Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a ‚Äúone off‚Äù defect.
The lids to not fit - you can get maybe two sides down and that is it. I also on two occasions found glass in my food. I had to toss the entire set. Surprising since it is an Amazon product.
"Between my teenagers and my 96 yo mother, given the scare about the toxins emitted from heating food in plastic, we tossed it all. This is one of the best all-around alternatives I've found. The lids lock on, and so they are a little difficult for my mother.  Two great things: that cabinet of plastics with the ever disappearing lids is clean, and I can rest assured at least this part of our daily living is more healthy."
"We have been trying to reduce our plastic use so we bought these. One of my bowls must have had a crack in it and shattered on top of my hand as I was getting it out of the cabinet. This glass breaks in very sharp shards. A severed tendon and a surgery later, I am out of work for several weeks and should regain mobility after a year of PT. I am now switching out all of my glass to reusable silicone. If you have this product, please be careful! This has been a very painful and expensive experience and I just want to prevent any one else from getting hurt."
"I read a number of the reviews of this product prior to purchasing and in all honesty had decided not too...except a friend of mine had glass dishes I really loved and when I aske her, she said this was the set she got. I decided to give them a try. Mine came well packaged and everything was in one piece. I haven't had any trouble with chipping so far (it's been about a week). I do only wash the lids by hand, never in the dishwasher, and they fit securely. You do need to apply a bit of pressure to get them open but that serves to prevent leaks. So far so good, I'll update this in about 3 months. --- So it's been 3 months and these have held up well. I am extra careful with them and I still only wash the lids by hand. I have been really pleased and would purchase again and recommend."
"Bought the 10 piece set, two of which came broken."
"I ordered these in January so I‚Äôd had them for about 7 months. I carry them to work almost everyday. I was fully expecting them to spill so I‚Äôd always put them in a waterproof/spill proof lunch box in my backpack to take to work. To my surprise, in the entire 7 months I‚Äôve had them they‚Äôve never spilled. I finally (surprised it took my clumsy self this long) dropped one of these. I dropped one of the bowls off the counter and saw it landing an inch away from my bare foot. I saw the life of my toes flash before my eyes. Sure enough, it just bounced around and didn‚Äôt even crack. We‚Äôre talking 3-4 feet off the counter on to the floor... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!? I‚Äôve both hand washed and ran these through the dishwasher and the seal is still A1. 15/10 recommend if you‚Äôre clumsy or don‚Äôt want your lunch all in your bag."
"Too difficult to open. If you have arthritis, stay away!"
"After my kids basically destroyed my plastic containers in the microwave and I could no longer scrub the tomato sauce red colour out, I knew it was time to get some glass containers. I was nervous about buying this ‚ÄúAmazon Basics‚Äù brand but am not disappointed with my purchase. These work well in the fridge, microwave and freezer. But just make sure you take the container out of the fridge and let it warm up slightly before putting it directly in the microwave. I‚Äôd not only buy these again but will look at other items to purchase from Amazon Basics."
"I LOVE these! Would highly recommend. Not only are they glass and so much better to use them plastic, they are completely airtight. Microwave so well. Clean so well. Also they look nice. I put these out when I have people over, and the glass bowls look very presentable. And it makes for an easy cleanup just to put the lids on in a Safeway and put it right in the fridge. I bought two packs of these because I‚Äôm that obsessed with this product!!  Very very durable, and I would highly recommend for any glassware. Not to mention the price is absolutely amazing!"
"Our fridge used to look like the food pantry blew up. I used to buy the cheapo plastic stuff you find at ""the mart"". I have lots of those left, with no lids, or lids with no same-size containers. Sound familiar? Every heat up leftover spaghetti sauce in a plastic container unthinkingly and now it looks like it has the blight? That will never come off. These glass containers are A.M.A.Z.I.N.G - and no, I'm not getting paid for this review - I wish I were. Our fridge is so well organized now, and you can heat up food in these heavy-duty glass containers no problemo. The lids are hard to loose, so we have not ended up with a lot of mismatched lid/containers. We love these darn things."
the lids are too weak and they break
"Ordered these and a similar set from Pyrex; these are better! However, I‚Äôm not sure the side-locking lids will stand the test of time (one has already broken). I have an old Pyrex set with stretch lids that seem more durable over the long haul (and easier to clean). I‚Äôve had those for 10+ years with no breakage. But these lids are better for storage / transporting food (they‚Äôre more leak proof). Hope this helps!"
"in all honesty, I was a tad bit hesitant to purchase an AmazonBasics product. For some reason I am trained to believe a generic Amazon brand cannot live up to Pyrex or Glasslock. BLOWN AWAY! Words that are not usually synonyms with storage containers. Starting with the shipping box- apart from a personal disdain for styrofoam - the simple/straightforward packaging was delivered with pieces resting inside each other along with a Care For slip was free of any other fluff to distract from the products. very nice. The products were lined with thin foam to prevent accidents during shipping, and the lids were shrink wrapped. After a rinse and soak in some bleach water, I removed the silicone rings air dried and put up for storage. I noticed that when cleaning water was getting under the glass lip on the outside, which added a few seconds to the cleaning process.  My first use of the product was taking lunch to work. very secure, very leakproof, and easy to heat. Overall the design, ease of use, BPA free traits have made these containters my new go to for any meal prep or food storage."
Being retired and single this is perfect for cooking a large quantity and freezing into smaller portions for me. I prefer glass containers because they go from freezer to oven. Easy to clean and when someone else shows up it's easy to take another out of the freezer. Great gift too!
"These are not the best space-saving dishes, but they are sturdy and definitely with a tight fit. I'm impressed that you can easily remove the gasket inside as well and throw all in the dishwasher WARNING: If you have serious arthritis in your hands, I wouldn't recommend. They are hard to close, and harder to open. I can still appreciate, as see being able to pack them despite the weight knowing they won't spill. GREAT OVERALL!"
"This is a great set and certainly equal to other more pricey brands. This is a set, so do be aware of the sizes, some of these dishes are on the small size, which is perfect for me as I am single. They are great for leftovers and lunches, and heat better in the microwave than plastic dishes do. They also hold the heat, so you don't feel like you have to race through your leftovers to eat them while they are still hot. I highly recommend these to everyone!"
Very pleased with these glass storage containers. The plastic tops sit on the glass lip securely and lock in place. Pleased with the items. They are dishwasher safe I am sure but I hand wash as I do not want any plastic warping and it takes just a few seconds.
"Needed storage containers for my Lake House. These are high quality, glass, with solid plastic lids. Leak proof. Much better tha similar plastic storage containers. Very inpressed with the quality. Go with GLASS. Ran them through the dishwaher before first use. Great product."
"We have some OXO bowls (similar to these) and the only difference I can find is a little lid tab (on the OXO). These bowls, in the variety of sizes) are proving themselves invaluable, saving much needed cabinet space and eliminating lots of plastic bowls ü§ó A great value for a great price!!"
The first package I received was damaged with half the lids cracked. Amazon customer service was great and I got a new set. The new set works well. Sometimes they seal so well they can be difficult to open. No issue for me but might make if difficult for others. Overall I plan to buy more to expand my collection. Do wish amazon offered a set of bigger containers as these are not large enough to pack a whole dinners leftovers or a salad in. The small ones are perfect for single serving and the large you can put a small meal in.
Love these containers these are way better than using stinking plastic containers they keep the food fresher plus they're easy to clean and you don't have to worry about odors from the previous food being in the container contaminating food that you put in the container later because it's glass
"These glass storage containers with locking lids are great! Very durable and clean up is a breeze. If I have to scrub food off, I just soak the container in hot, soapy water and that does the job. I like that you can storage food and use the same container to microwave the food and even eat right out of the container. The lids seal perfectly so I am very happy with this product. The items came when promised and I would buy from this seller again without hesitation."
This was my first set of this type of storage item. I was surprised how tightly the lids close and so easily opened. The glass is much more sanitary than the plastic I was using and easier to clean too. A great guy all in all and the assorted sizes are wonderful.
Keeps fruit lasting longer. I had blueberries and Raspberries transferred into these glass containers with a paper towel on bottom to absorb extra water and the fruit lasted 2 weeks longer than usual!! I freaking LOVE these! Completely leakproof
"I recently changed all my plastic to glass.... and what a life changing decision!!!! my food taste so much better, takes a while to go bad, holds in all the flavor, does not have that plastic taste. And its so so easy to clean, i love this so much! will be purchasing more in the future"
"dishes are great for baking and microwave, rather than plastic in the microwave. Then to also have a lid that fits snugly - it's great!"
It's holding up very well. I dropped one and it didn't break and the lids are holding up well to freezing and heating. I will say the lids are very hard to lock and open. Someone with hand problems like arthritis or such will have a hard time locking them and opening them.
"My daughter convinced me to try these and throw out all my mismatched plastic containers. So glad I did. These are great in every way -- perfect sizes, lids aren't cheapo, stack nicely. So unusual to open my cupboards and have my storage containers nice and tidy!!"
"These seal very tightly, look great and are just what I wanted to get away from using anything disposable. I am very pleased with the function, the quality, and the design. Will likely buy a second set."
Am giving up plastic storage containers due to the leeching issues. These are perfectly sized and make warming leftovers in the microwave a breeze. Easy to clean and doesn't stain like plastic.
"Exactly what I needed! Ordered a set for my daughter to take to her college dorm. When she decided to study from home this semester. I tried them out and loved them! They are a nice weight glass (not flimsy), perfect size to portion meals and leftovers, and easy to clean (dishwasher safe). Highly recommend."
I've had snapware for many years and liked it until they changed the seal they used which never worked well and now pyrex bought them.  But this from amazon uses the well made snapware gasket design which is really good and really seals the lid.
"I love these containers because the lids are easy to lock. I freeze in them, use in the microwave and use them to store in the refrigerator."
I love that they are the perfect size for snacks or left over meals. My only dislike is that the set does not come with an extra large lasagna pan.
I love them and very sturdy. I drop one on the floor and it didn‚Äôt break or chip. Nothing happened
My cut up veggies last so much longer when stored in one of these in the fridg. I got tired of the plastic containers as they don't last long before the inside starts to peel. One thing I don't like (and this is low on my list) is you can't take from fridg and heat the contents or it risks breakage .
"Really like the sizes and quality of the glass‚Äî‚Äîthick. The lids can be hard to secure, but I think once I use them often enough, they‚Äôll be fine. Otherwise, I just use my ‚Äúshower cap‚Äù covers. This was my final step in revising my kitchen food containers from plastic to glass."
Just what I was looking for. Have a different brand I bought years ago and wanted more but couldn't find the same brand. Got these and they are great. Like the sizes. Easy to clean. Great price.
"Works as advertised - probably better. Very secure positive seal, easy to clean."
Love the glass containers. I was using plastic but it doesn‚Äôt keep its shape if washed in the dishwasher. Lids disappear and that creates a problem. So I went to glass. Glass keeps its shape and for some reason pieces don‚Äôt disappear. The dishwasher does a great job of cleaning.
"amazon putitsnameon this product for good reason, high quality, many pieces, glass can go from fridge to microwave."
"Love these containers. I have always used glass, do not like plastic. The lids are little difficult to open and close as a have severe arthritis but it doesn't deter me."
"These are some heavy duty storage containers. The lids are very tightly fitted, so you know contents won't leak out. Very nice set of containers!"
The covers can be hard to deal with but they are air tight. The glass containers are perfect for everything.
"I've been using this set for some time now, and I am loving it! It's easy to clean, stores everything airtight, and is super convenient to heat my food in (my job doesn't have a microwave but we have a toaster oven)! I would absolutely recommend these over their plastic counterparts. They'll last forever!"
"My friend suggested these when I was looking for containers. I really love them. Good size selection, leak proof, dishwasher safe which was a must for me. Not too hard for my kids to close the lids."
These work great in the microwave. The lids lock 100% airtight and don't absorb color/flavor (I nuke veges w/ curry & Sriracha all the time). I also use the large container as cigar humidor and it's better than expensive wood humidors.
Awesome glass storage. Can be a bit tough to close lids but it works. Should of bought another set. Love them!
"I like the set of glass containers and got a fairly good deal on them. My only wish is that they were oven-safe to 450¬∞+ like Pyrex. I‚Äôve used a couple of them, but there was no deforming from the dishwasher to the lids like I see on my Pyrex bowl lids when I dry with heat."
Love these durable glass containers with snap down leak proof plastic lids. Glass container is dishwasher proof but prefer to wash lids in sink to prevent warping of plastic lids. Great improvement from snap on lids.
"I decided I was no longer going to use plastic bowls for work. Tried of bowls melting inside and staining. These were the answer, never stane or melt. Able to heat up in microwave and seal great , no leaks. Only issue is they could be heavy to carry but no pain no gain."
"We routinely have leftovers and we almost always take breakfast and lunch to work so quality containers are key for us.  The variety of sizes and no leak tops are great, and we‚Äôve learned that glass is better than plastic for durability and cleaning"
Love these! And the multiple size selection was portioned out perfect! I‚Äôve thrown away all plastic and transitioned to all glass! Side not: Tip: they are hard to open at first but I am noticing now they are loosening up. Just beware of this and use the side of your fingers not the tips so you don‚Äôt break a nail :)
"The lock feature almost locks too tight, but hey, better that than too loose. These are high quality and worth every penny. I'm tired of stained tupperware type storage containers and trying to get tomato sauce out of them, and these aren't that much more expensive. I'm sold."
These suckers will clamp down and seal great. Seal so well that when you remove the lid you have to remove the seal from the container to put back in the lid. This works out though because then you can make sure you are get all of the seal clean and not just the parts that are exposed to air.
Feels a little light and thin but seems durable. Have not chipped. Tight seal. But some liquid still makes its way out. Not a significant amount though.
I love the different sizes and what I can use them for mostly for storage in my kitchen.
"I‚Äôve used these for over a month now and I wish I had purchased them sooner! They are a thicker glass, though I am careful with them, and have a very tight seal when they are closed properly. I have to say I am a big fan. If anything happens I‚Äôll update the review."
This is a very versatile set. It is microwavable and easy to clean. These were the two things I wanted and why I got rid of a lot of my other containers.
"Brought as an Xmas gift. MNL loves them. She‚Äôs cooks A lot, and always has leftovers. These come in handy as they are very durable."
I had purchased these for myself in the past and liked them so well that I ordered some as a wedding gift!
Built very well and exactly what we needed to get rid of our plastic food storage. These are very nice looking and a much healthier choice.
"The packaging is exceptional. Very secure. The items are a perfect fit and solid for liquids. The containers are scent tight, air tight, and inhibit feezer burn. The glass is thick and durable."
They are the best for storing leftovers. They don't turn colors like plastic storage containers do if you have a tomato food you are storing. My daughter-in-law gave me a set. I have enjoyed them and my mother saw them and wanted some so l ordered this set.
Easy to clean. Durable. Pretty. Why pay more?
My daughter decided to move out from her mother's house (daughter is in her second year of law school) and move to an apartment very close to where I live. One of the items she asked for her birthday was some Tupperware storage containers. I decided to go with the Amazon Basics alternative since she enjoys cooking and frankly glass is a better storage option than plastic. She was very happy with the choice...
"I love that they can go in dishwasher, top shelf I‚Äôm been very pleased, great product"
they are very nice!
I use these for leftovers mostly but also use for vegetables and fruit. They are durable but they are glass also.
"OK...full disclosure...I bought 2 different brands of food storage containers for my pantry. This brand is by FAR the best on the market! I love that the containers are clear and not opaque. It is very easy to see what is inside and how much of each product you have left. The labels are cute and random different shapes. I really liked that. The stickers for the labels were easy to remove. The chalk marker has a nice fine tip that makes label making easy to read. I also really like the closing mechanism on the containers. The other brand I bought was really a struggle to put the lids on securely. These, I have full confidence that when I reach for my rice and tip the container that the lid is snug and those nightmare accidental spills simply will not happen. The closure would even be easy for someone with arthritis or shaky hands to use. I highly recommend this product as it is 100% the best quality food storage container on the market. You will have a forever customer with me!"
"The ROLLS ROYCE of food storage! üíñüíñüíñ  Absolutely love these containers from Chef‚Äôs path!! Have been searching for a good set for quite some time and am happy I stumbled upon these.  I feel these containers are of a higher quality than others and the price is much more affordable.  I really like the fact that the lid handles are made up of durable plastic  The assortment of sizes is a plus, they‚Äôre easy to stack one on another and are rather durable. The locking mechanism works well to seal but not difficult like others I‚Äôve tried to open.  The Pen, chalkboard Labels & measuring spoon set are a great addition to the Set. Everything you might need for pantry organization has been provided.  The sizes of the containers are also just perfect for my needs.  I also really liked that the company includes a great note with your purchase and contacts you by email after purchase to check that you are happy  I feel like these are really going to hold up well over time and serve as great staple pieces in my pantry. I would definitely make this purchase again and am already thinking about ordering more to make my pantry even more streamlined and organized!"
"Absolutely love these containers! I am big on the smell of plastic and these areüëå. They have no smell, no after test of plastic, and are airtight-keeping everything fresh! Even the box they can in was very study and organized!! Highly recommend and will definitely order again!!"
"2020 Pandemic Pantry Project. I waited a while to write this review. I watched a video of one of the consumers and read all of the reviews but, not before looking at many other brands of storage containers. I started with the largest set. Did the water test. It's true, no leaks! I live in south Florida. I needed something that would work in this climate. Rest assured, these do!! I love puffcorn. They are like cheesepuffs but lighter. I put a bag in a container and, a week later, they were just as fresh as the day I originally put them in it. If you are considering these, DO NOT HESITATE!! You won't be sorry. OH, and the customer service is outstanding. Waleed, if you read this, thank you again for the complete new set that you sent to replace ONE piece that was broken during shipping. Amazing. I have purchased 5 different sets for my pantry needs and am over the moon. You even receive labels, a chalk marker and a set of measuring cups or spoons ,depending on the set you choose. I'm even considering purchasing more of the tall, slim pasta sets which come with a tool to help you measure the amount of pasta for different serving sizes. They really think of everything! Thank you again, Chefspath! 5 stars.  UPDATE: 16 Months later and this product still doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend the Chefs Path containers. I have since also purchased the new style Chefs Path pasta containers. They work as well as the original sets that I have purchased. The new style containers, for pasta, are long and the lids don't fit the original tall containers. The pasta containers do stack well which means you save even more space in your pantry. By far, the Chefs Path containers are the best purchase I have ever made through Amazon. If you live in a tropical climate and are considering these containers, don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed."
"Let‚Äôs start with the cons, there aren‚Äôt many: these aren‚Äôt worth $70, these are like snap fit containers. They leave large gaps between them wasting probably 1/4th of yourself space which you‚Äôll could fill with little things like seasoning envelopes but you will get a very cluttered look, alternatively if you‚Äôre physically impaired this may be a pro as it makes taking the thing off the shelf very easy and third they‚Äôre quite difficult to pull apart when you receive them to the point it has an instructional video, which I didn‚Äôt look at, but all the videos in the world won‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt have the hand strength to pull them apart - not good for the elderly or physically impaired. Otherwise I think they‚Äôre fabulous, they‚Äôre neat, clean, feel good in your hand, look nice, I like that you can put the label where you want so I placed mine if the side for my kids but where I don‚Äôt have to see them looking cluttered because I know what everything is. The tops seal easily and well and even with physical impairment or lack of hand strength would be relatively easy to open, none of mine were missing seals. Definitely worth a look if you want to drop $70 on some tall snap wear but the $50 price point is where it should be."
"I absolutely LOVE that all of the containers use the same size lid! No more searching for multiple sized lids! ***Waterbottle in the photo is for size reference. Not all the items are in the photo--I had already started to wash and dry. Order comes with 6 of each size, 24 containers and lids. Labels in the photo were a separate order from a different company. I did not use the chalkboard labels that came with this order.*** Durable and airtight and spill-proof too! I knocked some over before I transferred them all to the pantry...no breakage, no spillage. I totally already ordered a second set. Some of the smaller sizes would be perfect for bathroom/first aid storage. ***Note: make sure to let the lids dry COMPLETELY after washing. The channel with the rubber gasket around the lid can hold a little water so look out before sealing up your dry goods!"
"These are nice quality and can fit a wide array of food in them. My only complaint is the picture shown makes them appear to be clear plastic and while yes, they are, it‚Äôs not as clear as the photo. If that makes sense. It‚Äôs not clear bard plastic is has the whiteish appearance to it. They are fine, I‚Äôm just being picky. The quality is really wonderful and they work for what I needed."
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about not only these containers but the company and customer service too! The containers are great quality. The kids fit great and remain airtight. GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR. We looked at several containers online and thought these were the best value. We were a little worried about what we would get but figured we could return them if we didn‚Äôt like them. Boy, what a pleasant surprise! These containers are a good thickness and the sizes are perfect. We love them. MOST IMPORTANTLY, this company‚Äôs customer service is off the chart!! They say they pride themselves on their customer service and THEY MEAN IT! Once we ordered we received a message from the Co-Founder ensuring everything was good and we loved our containers. When we replied back with questions, he promptly replied, answered our questions. There was some confusion and I thought we didn‚Äôt get what we ordered because my wife ran off with containers right away. The Co-Founder went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction - both before and after I discovered there truly wasn‚Äôt a problem. This company‚Äôs home page of their website has a place to send them messages. No digging through pages or searching for contact information, their contact info is right there like they welcome your comments. Many companies could take a lesson in customer service from them. I highly recommend their products!"
"Organized my whole pantry with these! I bought three sets. I love them. I like that the marker is chalk so if you need to change the label just take a damp towel and it wipes off. Getting bigger ones for cereal and chips. The ones here don‚Äôt work great for that. Perfect for pasta, snacks, baking supplies (not flour or sugar, not big enough) and beans and rice."
I have been using them for a few weeks now and LOVE THEM!! They make my pantry and cupboards look so much better and they are so organized now. I have already ordered 2 more sets! When I received my order and one of the containers was broken. I emailed the company directly because that is what the letter that comes with the containers asks you to do. They were fantastic. It did take a couple of days for them to get back to me but they are a small business and I think it was within reason. They were super easy to work with and got me another set of containers right away. I promise you will be satisfied with your purchase.
I liked them however they do not hold a full bag of flour or a full bag of sugar
"I got the big set, when I unpackaged it, my heart sank at the thought of washing and drying all of these. I have a portable dishwasher and would've only been able to fit half and not the tall containers in at a time. So I handwashed them all which got rid of the plastic smell, and then hand dried them because I didn't have room to have them covering every inch of counter space for the next 4 days to dry. This involved 3 thick dish towels and several paper towels.  Finally it came time to fill them! I started with my baking cupboard - standard above the sink size with a shelf in the middle. Tall ones didn't fit standing up and BARELY FIT on their side (makes the cupboard door hang open about 1 mm). They are awkward on their side because of their odd tapered shape and bulky lids.  I've never liked the 4 snap lids but sometimes you make adjustments for organization's sake. Some sizing findings- I fit two bags of brown sugar in one tall container. I fit one jumbo and half a regular bag of chocolate chips in a second smallest container. A 3lb bag of sugar almost fit in a tall one. a standard box of corn starch that was 1/4 used barely fit in a small one. I transferred as much as I could from my baking cupboard, then moved on to my snack cupboard, and then miscellaneous cupboard. I had 5 containers of various sizes left over and that was after using 2 small ones without lids to organize some of my silicone stretch lids and reusable ziplock bags.  As expected, these were terrible to dry. Even after leaving out and then hand drying with a towel and then paper towel, water gets in/around/under the silicone ring in the lid no matter what. That's a major flaw and is going to create mold/mildew.  The shape works depending on your cabinet height and depth.  The stickers and marker work OK but the marker takes forever to dry and mine smudged easily unless I let it sit 5+ minutes before peeling up and applying.  PROS: Can only help organization. Secure and air tight. Comes with everything you need but no extra labels.  CONS: shape is odd, drying is a problem, moisture in the lids is a problem, they are not 100% recycled materials, and they come with an insane amount of plastic waste for packaging. Every single container is wrapped in plastic, the marker and measuring cups is wrapped in non-recyclable plastic, as is every individual sheet of labels! This is not necessary and counter-productive.  I got the big set, when I unpackaged it, my heart sank at the thought of washing and drying all of these.

This is not necessary and counter-productive.  Update 11/2020: unfortunately these aren't as airtight/moisture tight as I had first thought. My sugars and salt get hard/solid and clumpy. The lids come off if only one flap is loosened as well. I will still continue to use them but I won't be getting any more. I have 9 year old glass containers from ikea with no-clamp lids with silicon seals that keep dry goods 100% dry and were much cheaper."
"If I could give this a ZERO RATING I would!! I bought these because they had more good reviews than bad. I should have listened to the BAD reviewers! I finally got around to cleaning my pantry and was excited to use these. Unfortunately, These are ALL SMALL containers! SEE PHOTO OF PASTA IN CONTATINER! How am I supposed to get the lid on without breaking up the pasta? NOW I'M OUT $45 BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE RETURNED!!!!! They are hard to close and some won't close all the way and they smell!! I guess that's why they have a no return policy. I will do as my husband told me next time I order from Amazon,"" Make sure that you can return it before you purchase."" DON'T BUY THESE, YOU CAN GET SOME FROM THE DOLLAR STORE FOR LESS!!!!!"
"Bought these to store tall things in fridge door: celery, scallions, fennel, etc. Three of them fit in the racks just fine; can stack other containers on top. Used the fourth one for dried pasta in the pantry. Just what I was looking for!"
I love this set. I did a ton of research before deciding on this set. I was super excited about it. I was looking at their smaller set of 6 but then would need at least 2 packs. At that point it was only 2 dollars more to get the 28 piece vs 12. So I was super happy and impressed. When I got these one lid was broken but I contacted their support and they emailed me right away and said they would send a new one. Awesome customer service for sure. I love the set.
"We selected these containers for their design. The narrow design was important to us given we had narrow cabinets. They have the same sized lids which make it easier to find the right lid and makes these stackable.  The build quality appears very good. Flexible yet strong. I haven't used the labels and given the containers are transparent, not sure I will use them.  One of the containers came broken. It was shipped in the original product packaging without the standard Amazon box and bubble wrap. No surprise it broke.  I contacted the seller and sent the picture of the broken container. He promptly shipped a replacement box with seven containers. Great customer service."
"What I like about these particular containers is the fact that the lids lock and there are airtight. I can access my pasta easily and they fit nicely on my counter top. I used to store them in their original packaging and wrap them in plastic wrap to try and keep the weevils at bay but it didn‚Äôt work so well. Fed up with these buggies, I ordered a set of four back in June 2020, and loved them so much I placed another order for two more sets this month. November 2020. Which I split between my two kids and myself. I do add a couple of bay leaves to the pasta which also keeps the weevils at bay. Get it? Teehee ü§≠. They also come with pasta measuring sticks (which I‚Äôve never seen and never use but that‚Äôs cool too) and labels with writing marker. Definitely a keeper."
These containers are great. They have a rubber seal that can hold water after washing so look out for that before filling them but otherwise they are perfect for organizing all of the many dry ingredients I have in the pantry. I purchased two sets which is quite excessive for most pantries but any other fellow whole food plant based cooks will understand this need for excess
"When my first set came, I immediately ordered a second, then a third...and...the fourth one is arriving today. ü§£ I live that the length and width of each container is uniform-the same lid fits every single size!!! They lock super tight. I wasn‚Äôt planning to use the chalkboard labels and marker that come with, but once I started I couldn‚Äôt stop. Thrilled with the product and the excellent, responsive service from the company. Looking forward to more products from them!"
"Pests such a little moths have been a problem in the past and it is necessary to protect my food supply from them so I need something with a good seal and that will help to maximize my available shelf space. I like to keep enough dry food on hand as preparation for an emergency or a disaster and try to keep the supplies rotated. I ordered the 14-piece set which actually has 14 pieces not counting the lids. That sets this product apart from the beginning as most other companies count the lids as well as the container. True that there are a number of small containers but that's what I wanted. The small containers work in my plan to maximize available space. So does the square shape and the ability to stack them to fit the spaces neatly. The labels save a lot of time and look much neater than those I make myself. I live in an earthquake prone area, so these are appropriate for that reason as well. They are less likely to fall and much less likely to break than other containers. My set came with 2 broken tabs and missing the label kit. I emailed the customer support and got a prompt response. I was also hoping I could purchase extra lids in the future is more of them broke with long time use. The replacements came quickly as promised and I was surprised to get a generous additional supply as a bonus. That rarely happens, but that seems to be the way this company operates to earn all the 5-star reviews. I anticipate being a repeat customer and also will be giving some to friends to try out. Generosity begets generosity. It's also a good business policy."
"I love the clear containers and am SUPER happy with the four-way lid closures. I am packing for a major move and was worried about my pantry staples going bad or spilling. After a brief try out period and multiple home testing for seal security, I am happy to say I am no longer worried about the safety of my supplies.  I am very happly with the Chef's Path company. They were very friendly and eager to assure that I got what I was expecting and happy with their product. I give them a big thumbs up!!!"
"When these arrived I was instantly excited to get started on my pantry. I ready so many reviews on this brand before committing and I‚Äôm glad I did! The box and packaging was very nice, while getting the containers apart was a two person job (I have nerve issues and weakness in arms/hands), washing was a breeze. The seal comes out of the lids so you can really get all the crevices dried thoroughly. I then went to work trying to pick the lucky winners from the pantry that would get their new home inside these nifty containers. It took me an hour probably total to get everything done the way I wanted (I‚Äôm a little obsessive about organization), but once I was done these 14 containers helped me gain an entire shelf in my pantry! That night I wound up ordering two more sets and plan to order the $70 set eventually as well! I really love the airtight seals and the quality of these containers far exceeds what I expected for the price point. Obviously if you do the math buying the bigger sets gets you more bang for your buck but if you just need a few containers to finish off your collection these seriously are well worth the price! I saw some reviews complain about the shape and how it leaves unused space in their pantry. I honestly think the spacing is necessary and makes grabbing a single container out easy for any age from toddler chubby hands to grown man hands to my nerve damaged hands. And as I already mentioned, I gained an entire shelf just with these 14 containers. So I don‚Äôt find the shape to be a deterrent at all for me. I‚Äôm truly impressed by the quality, packaging, customer service, all of it! I‚Äôve already bragged to quite a few of my friends. If you‚Äôre on the fence because these aren‚Äôt a name brand, don‚Äôt be... you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"After ordering these, I was very pleased with their sturdiness, and the ability to really seal these containers, however, I would have preferred that they were not so tapered toward their base. These containers are super duper except that they are tapered too much at their base. They're a bit top heavy and fall over easily. Other than that one feature - I thought they were excellent, air-tight containers."

They fit the things I need very well. I held one of them under a bowl full of water and no water got in. The only thing I wish could be better are the rubber seals. It'd be better if they were thicker to make it even more airtight/waterproof and to make it easier to clean the lid completely. You need to use a toothpick to take out the rubber seal.
Misleading advertisement. Clearly quality is not as advertised. You can see that item received is not the same as pictured.
I feel that the container's are just as nice in person. The sizes are accurate. It is the beginning of organizing my pantry. All the tops are one size fit all so I don't have to worry about size. The tops snap on all four sides easily. They are dishwasher safe and easy to wipe clean if needed. I will get a smaller set after I see what more that I need. I also received a nice letter from the growing family business if I have any issues or concerns. I am glad to say that I am happy and excited. Good job Chefs Path!
"These food storage sets are amazing. I ordered both this Multi-size 14-piece set and the Large 4-piece set: - They're very well made. The plastic is thick and durable, very inflexible in comparison to cheaper plastic containers. - The lids seal perfectly to the containers without being difficult to snap open and shut. - The stacking is so satisfying! - I loved the packaging. The boxes both sets came in were sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, and very space conscious. - The ONLY downside to this was that the containers were packed tightly together and a little hard to separate, less so for the smaller ones. However, this is something the company must have been aware of because they included an insert with a site to visit for tips on separating the containers, and even though I didn't need it, the thoughtfulness was really nice. - That said, there was just a very personal feel to the whole package with the insert that introduces the company and makes it feel like Chef's Path genuinely cares about every customer. - The teaspoon and tablespoon measuring set, the labels, and the marker that was included with the set was a very nice touch. All in all, a fantastic product and an even more fantastic company! I'll be adding more containers to my collection in the future, and they'll be my go-to for any food storage needs in the long run."
"I was looking forward to using these containers for everything-- flour, tea, catnip, all sorts of stuff. When I opened the box and got to the lids, there was a weird, burning chemical smell.  I soaked them for hours and the smell is still there. I will admit that I deal with hypersensitivity to things like perfume and artificial flavors and dyes. This could be why I am noticing such a strong smell on the lids, so your individual experience may vary. My mother and husband also smell it, but not as strongly as I do.  Even if you're lucky enough to not notice a weird smell, it is obvious that there is something strange in the lid seal. I really don't want that tainting my dry goods. I will be returning these and looking for something less sketchy."
"When I ordered these, I never thought I'd be able to use them all, but I ordered them anyway, because of the good reviews and the price for the amount of containers being sold. I started dehydrating vegetables from my garden this year, instead of canning, so when I ordered these, they were to put dehydrated tomato slices in. As you can see in the picture, I decided this would work better for everything, so I can get what I need each time and not have to worry about vacuum sealing again each time. I'm using some to put candy bars and M&M's in (we'll pretend it's for when the grandkids come to visit) I didn't give any stars for freshness, because I just got them today, but I'll come back and update that once I can honestly answer it. As it says in the headline, I'm pleased so far. They are sturdy, they seal nicely, and since I don't have a dishwasher, they, like everything else, they are a pain in the, you know, that thing, to clean, but this is no fault of the manufacturer. I wonder if they could send me a good woman? We could switch off every other day washing dishes. If she'd help pull weeds in the garden, that would be a bonus."
"I received the chefs path storage dry food containers, I love the sturdy packing, they came in and when I opened the box they were thick sturdy plastic and lids. I am very very very pleased. I really like the labels and marker they provide, so I can organize my pantry with these wonderful labels. I would highly recommend. Don't go to big lots, homestore places like come to this company. They were quick and the product look just like the picture. I am very well satisfied customer üëç. Mrs. James"
"I loooooove these containers, they make my pantry look super neat and organized!! I bought these tall containers plus two boxes of the smaller ones. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G quality and seal. I used these to store snacks and baking supplies and they definitely keep the freshness of the product. I also love that you could use them in the fridge! I put my blueberries/blackberries/strawberries in the smaller containers. Keeps my refrigerator organized.  One of the containers had a little dent on them and the customer service went above and beyond! A+ from beginning to the end. They sent me a new box without hassle. Super please w/ this product and the customer service provided! Will definitely be buying more in the future, I‚Äôm addicted to organizing my kitchen stuffüòÇ"
"Have others like this and love them. But I received these today and one is cracked. Can‚Äôt find a like to complain so I‚Äôm posting here hoping for a replacement. I do like these and don‚Äôt want to return all of them because of one being cracked, but would like it made good. Update and changed to 5 stars. The company contacted me and replaced the cracked one, they actually sent an entire set and wanted nothing returned. They were prompt to reply and I absolutely love the containers. Highly recommend them and the company."
"I love these containers. If you‚Äôre trying to organize your pantry these are a must! I have different containers from other brands. The other brand is clear, hard plastic whereas these are not ‚Äúas see through‚Äù if that makes sense. The problem with the other brand is that the plastic cracks very easily where as these are much more durable. I like the fact that it comes with many different sizes the smaller size can be used as Tupperware for leftovers. The labels and markers work well. I find that to erase the marker to write something new, windex works well. Just spray a little drop and rub it in with your finger then wipe. The containers have a good seal to keep food fresh. The best part though, is the customer service. In my original order one of the lids arrived broken. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement lid. Instead of sending me a lid or 2, they ended up sending me a whole other set! That is very sweet of them to do! As a small business owner myself, I really appreciate that type of customer care because I always go above and beyond for my clients, so it‚Äôs great to see other companies do that as well. I also liked the set of measuring spoons that came with it. They are colorful and whymsical. Since I already have 2 sets that I use for cooking/baking I put these in the containers with the appropriate serving for that item, this way it‚Äôs always in there and ready for me to use. For ex. I put the spoons in my maca, lions mane, ashwagandha, spirulina and all the things I use for my smoothies. So that worked out great."
"This is a top notch company that stands behind its product. I highly recommend purchasing and doing continued business with Chefs Path. They stand firmly behind their products and respond incredibly fast to concerns or questions. I say this because I had the pleasure of experiencing this great service first hand. It's time to support family businesses instead of the big box stores. This is truly a family business that deserves to stay afloat during these tough times. Their product is fantastic and their customer support is stupendous and genuine, they really do care! Support them and purchase their fabulous products, dont hesitate, this is the best!"
"Good quality with great style. These were just as I expected and they work perfectly in the intended space. I was actually surprised that I was able to use them all so quickly as I thought I couldn‚Äôt possibly have enough to fill them all, but I did! I love that they are stackable and I love the chalkboard stickers with the included pen. You can easily wet erase, dry, and label again. These containers, though pricey, are actually economical comparatively. A popular brand container of the same size as the largest in this set runs for $18. Yes, they are clear and have special closing mechanism but if you are on a budget as I am, the Chef‚Äôs Path are far worth it in comparison. Some things to note, these are not perfectly clear plastic, they are slightly opaque which I was aware of when I made my purchase but once filled they look great and it doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least. I love that they are decorative since they are on exposed shelving in my kitchen. I‚Äôm going to add some baskets on my lowest shelf to complete the look. I would recommend!"
"Honestly I just barely got these, and I'm really excited. I am not a tidy person, not because I don't care but because I have a hard time organizing large spaces. I find containers to be immensely helpful. Every time I find something I can containerize, my world gets more organized. That's one of the reasons I'm excited for these containers.  They're not hard to get apart. All you have to do is hold the top one, and pull gently on the ones on the bottom. Don't try to remove the bottom one first. If you hold on to the top, and gently pull on it once on the bottom, gravity will do it's thing. It might take a few seconds, but it's actually kind of fun to do.  We have a big problem with rodents in this house. They got in over the winter, and we're really having a rough time with them. My brother's goal is to poison them, my goal is to bore them to death. I'm very excited that I can put any open food in a container that mice will not be able to get into easily. I mean I could have a really wanted to, but it would be much easier to go find something else to eat. I am extremely excited about these. As I go on, I'll come back and tell you what other cool things I found out about him.  The picture that you can't identify, is the needles for insulin pens. I have had a really big problem with losing the Box they come in. This way the Box stays put, I can find my needles, they don't end up on the ground, and I have a clear view of how many I have left. Freaking awesome!!!"
"I purchased the set of 24 containers and I couldn‚Äôt love it more. The sizes are great for all of your storage needs. They are very affordable compared to other storage systems and the quality of the product is excellent. I cleaned my pantry and I find myself opening the door just to look at how organized it is. No more misc. bags or boxes everywhere. Everything is neatly stored in clear containers with locking lids and write on labels. They are super easy to wash by hand or just throw in the dishwasher. Although, I found the tallest ones would not fit in my dishwasher. The customer service at this company is amazing. I will probably buy another set soon."
"I ordered these to organize my pantry and keep things fresh with the airtight feature. The product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well. Since the container are nested inside each other, I thought it was going to be difficult to separate them but there was instructions provided in the box with a link to a video to show how to easily separate the containers. That was very helpful!  I washed the containers before using them and noticed that water was trapped under the rubber seal. This was an easy fix as I just removed the black, rubber seal and allowed to air dry. The rubber seal is easy to both remove and replace.  The containers are the thickness of Rubbermaid and Tupperware storage products and they stack very well and are easy to open and close. The various sizes make it easy to store a wide variety of foods. The black, rubber seal helps lock in food freshness and is just the right thickness.  Very happy with these! Highly recommended!!!"
"Wow, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set. I really wish I could afford to pick up more right now, they are perfect!!! I didn't find them small at all, the reason the box that comes in the mail is smaller in size than some might expect is because they package them perfectly inside each other. They can be a bit tough to get out of the packaging because they are packed tightly, (they do included a card with a link to show best way to get them apart), but once you get them out you have the perfect set!!! They're sturdy, this, airtight, clean lines, washed nicely in the dishwasher. They come with labels and a chalk marker, easy to use. Mine are neatly put away inside my pantry but look great out and viewable as well. I want them in every size/shape they come in so I could do the whole pantry!!! I'm in love with this set. I even suggested it to my daughter who bought a slightly different set from the same company, for her apartment and LOVES THEM TOO, they have many different sizes too meet just about any need to might have. I used mine for three different kinds of pasta the spaghetti in the tallest, I also have egg noodles an elbow macaroni in the two step down sizes. I also used it for candy/snacks for my son who has special needs, he will now be able to get his own instead of struggling with a bag to open all the time. Very happy with my purchase and the sizes I received, as the measurements given in pics and description were spot on. I'm hoping to get the two large container set that my daughter got for my flour and sugar."
"I recently tried these containers....and I understand all the rage! I appreciated the description that stated their sizes, which allowed my to decide what could be stored in them and the amounts. Although they are not clear containers as they are advertised - which is more aesthetically pleasing - they are clear enough to easily see what is in them. The plastic seems durable and the lids seem to seal pretty good. I also appreciated the packaging, which had soft dividers between each container - allowing them to come apart smoothly and hassle free. The set is for average sized items (as opposed to the larger 'family' sized boxes or bags of food) so they are intended for typical proportions. Lastly, the nice, multi-shaped label stickers and colorful measuring spoons were lovely additions of detail that was not overlooked and was much appreciated. Time and usage will ultimately determine how good these containers are but so far I really like them."

"I scour the reviews before buying products and was pretty convinced these would be what I wanted. They're excellent. Strong plastic, airtight seals, and easy to open and close (i.e. you don't have to make sure the ""tabs"" line up on each side when you're pushing them down). Also, I think it's great that they come WITH the ""chalkboard"" labels and the white pen. Nice bonus! It got two of my kitchen cabinets cleaned up & organized in a very short time. I'm definitely planning to buy more. Also was impressed with the immediate attention from the company. Way to go, Chef's Path!"
"I am an organization snob‚Ä¶ Meaning everything needs to be in its place and everything needs to have a place. I have a very small pantry with a very deep shelves and was getting tired of rummaging through things to find anything let alone having to reach all the way back to get some thing I needed. I love the way but these sizes work well with each other. The tall ones go on the back the next size down goes in front of those and so on. If you put the labels right underneath the clip where the lid is you‚Äôll be able to see everything. And the price for this set couldn‚Äôt be any better. Some of you may say that $70 is a lot for plastic bins‚Ä¶ But if you go and look at other individual bins from other sellers you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre going to pay $10-$12 for one bin. If you do the math you‚Äôre actually only paying a little under $3.00 per container. They are a good quality material, they seal well so food will stay fresh and they are very easy to clean. I have already ordered the set of 4 cereal bins and have a few more of their items in my wish list cart. Chef‚Äôs Path is the reason my pantry will finally be organized they way I‚Äôve always wanted it to be."
"These. Containers. Are. Awesome! I would've never bought these before, but we rehabbed our kitchen and we now have a large pantry in the kitchen. So I wanted it to look nice and organized and thought, what the heck I'll try it. I don't know why I never used things like this before. It is so organized and clean and everything fits together in the pantry drawer. The containers themselves are very sturdy. After I washed them, there was no evidence of any kind of plastic smell, still haven't noticed that after weeks in my pantry. The lids are fairly easy to navigate. I have RA and my hands can hurt a lot from time to time, but these lids are not difficult to open at all. Highly recommend!"

"I bought these a few months ago to help organize my pantry better. I live out in Indiana and am surrounded by fields. Certain times of the year are known for mice trying to get in your house. I have had problems with them getting in my pantry and destroying food. This allows me to have an organized pantry and to keep my food safe. I have dropped them by accident on the laminate floor(not often) and they have held up well. The labels are fantastic so I know exactly what is in there. It is easy for anyone looking in my pantry to easily find something. The tall ones have been great for spaghetti, lasagna, manicotti, and even cereal. I used to have the tall Rubbermaid containers, but those took up a lot of space. These hold a lot and don't take up near as much room. I can easily put several side by side. I also purchased the next size down because I loved these so much. If you are looking to organize your pantry and need something functional and reasonably priced, I would definitely suggest these."
I got my containers and love them. I noticed I was missing one of the smaller container from the set and contacted the seller via email and explained. They were quick to resolve it and said they were sending out one to me. To my surprise it was a whole new set of the containers. Was not expecting that and emailed back thank you and was only expecting just the missing container but they insisted on 100% customer satisfaction which I was and more so. Great product and does as it says and great customer service!
*BUYER BEWARE * NOTHING. LIKE. THE. PICTURE.  If you‚Äôre looking to make your pantry aesthetically pleasing and think you‚Äôll be receiving a product that looks like the picture‚Äî DO NOT PURCHASE!!! These are just regular Tupperware- they are not clear like in the picture!!!!!!!
"I have been busy mom and not able to shop in stores, which is why I ended up with these. Cheap trick and shame on amazon for letting customers be fooled. Some day amazon will also doom for such tricks. To dear buyers, Buy them only if you are ok for below flaws. 1)In ad photos they show clear plastic boxes, in real we get regular plastic. Plz see my photos. 2) Quality is cheap 3)All given dimensions are messed up. Much smaller in real. 4) Non refundable 5)Smells like chemical I know we all need to make money to live so I am just giving bad review and make peace with the boxes and use them. Next time I will get from my dear Costco where I can return even after a year...but tbh, who would return good quality."
"EDIT/UPDATE I originally gave 3 stars for receiving broken containers and had just emailed the customer service and was too impatient to wait for a response..... but, since getting ahold of them, and they responded quickly and corrected the issue with no problem!!!!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING!!!!!  ORIGINAL: I was so excited when i got these!!!! but as i went through and washed them and started to fill them i got down to the last couple stacks of the containers and a few were broke. which is very unfortunate because I really need to use all I can. was considering buying another pack until i ran into this issue. If they are broke from shipping, will they last through daily use of opening and closing? i would hate for them to start to break after use also. unfortunately I may send the whole thing back and try again else where."
"I have been hoping to bring some order to my pantry for awhile and have always loved the idea of most everything in clear consistent containers. These made the transition cost effective and convenient. I love the sizes, and the seal from the lids is secure. They stack well and look nice. I also didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôd be more convenient when I actually need to measure ingredients because of the wide rigid openings - it‚Äôs really easy to get spoons and measuring utensils in and out and leveled off, or to control how fast/slow contents pour out compared to many items‚Äô original packaging. I know that sounds silly and it‚Äôs not a huge thing but I‚Äôve been surprised by how often I‚Äôve appreciated that unexpected benefit in the last week since I‚Äôve been using them. The seller‚Äôs customer service is also awesome. I had one container that was broken when it arrived, and the seller was easy to work with and quick to work out a replacement option for me. I would definitely recommend."
"1/18/21 - Upon contacting the seller, we were made whole in a very timely manner. Customer Service was great and we'd order again from this seller.  We received this item and all of the containers and lids were accounted for. There were no broken lids as others have mentioned. However, there were no labels or marker which was one of the main draws to this particular item. We have other measuring spoons so that's not a big deal but the concern comes into play when something is supposed to be included but isn't. We contacted the firm directly to request replacements of the missing pieces but have not received a response. We don't recommend this item based upon the lack of items and response."
"While I love OXO storage containers, they can get pricey when you need a handful of them. I found these on a deal and took a chance .  These storage containers are truly airtight. I put pretzels that were already opened in one over three weeks ago and they aren't stale at all. This was my number one must.y containers had to actually keep dry goods fresh. These do the job very well.  The tops secure shut by the four heavy duty tabs. They are sometimes tough to open so if that's important to you these may not be for you. I have found that they seem to have gotten easier to open since I have been using them. Hopefully it's because they needed to be worked a bit and not because the seal fails slowly. I've had them for 5 weeks and so far so good. I'll update in a few months.  They are thick and seem really durable. My son dropped two already and they were fine. For the price and amount you get combined with the quality I am really very happy with this purchase and would definitely repurchase."
"I needed something to corral all my pasta, cereal, baking supplies, etc. I have a set of another brand that I use on my flour, sugar, etc, for baking. Their biggest containers barely held 5 lbs of flour, and then if you smooshed/shook in the last couple of cups. I had no problem getting reasonable quantities into this set. For my larger stash of dry goods (rice, pasta, flour, bulk baking mixes etc) I purchased their other containers which will hold gobs more. Their XXL size holds a gallon & a half each. More than enough for rice, flours, sugar, beans, etc. Or even the jumbo bagged cereals. Their XL size holds a just over a gallon as well. The bodies and lids are translucent, not crystal clear as some have complained, but you can still see the volume of your product. The lids come in only a few sizes so that you can leave search for that 1 lid that only fits that container, in the dust.  I had one container that arrived broken and I contacted the sell with a picture and the order number. They quickly and efficiently credited to my account the cost of the single container. (I figure I will slap some packing tape over the cracked portion, and use it to hold office supplies.) I purchased a total of 4 sets of the 24, 4 sets of the XL, and 4 sets of the jumbo XXL, and their flatter noodle pack that holds spaghetti, lasagna, or linguine noodles easily.  I would highly recommend Chef's Path's products to anyone trying to simplify and organize their kitchen. The free labels & measuring cups/spoons are a nice addition."
"My pantry was a jumble of bags tossed all over each other and was a pain to find anything. These are exactly what I needed to organize everything. They're a great size, very tight seal around the lid yet easy to open/close because of the style of the lids. One of the containers arrived broken, so I messaged the seller and they sent me an entirely new set the same day. I couldn't be happier!"
"Pros: Overall, this set of panty containers is great. Easy to clean, easy to fill and pour, and the lids fit and snap perfect. Love that all the lids are the same size. I cannot speak to the longevity or freshness of products long term as I just received. But they feel like quality made products. The chalk labels are an added bonus and adds to the cohesive look. Cons: two containers arrived broken. See photos. The plastic appears to be cracked from shipping and the broken plastic was at the bottom of the box. This gives me concern about longevity of the plastic. However, there was no padding in the shipping box, so this could be a shipping fault and no fault on the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the damaged tops do not allow the lids to fit properly or latch. I am waiting to hear back from the company as to a fix for this issue as these were not inexpensive containers. Also, it seems that with washing the lids, water collects along the seam with the seal. Hopefully this does not affect the seal or the product stored in the container."
"Used these and ""can steps"" (spice shelf) to organize my pantry last weekend. Even the small size holds a nice amount. Love the black customizable labels and chalk pen. A reminder - when washing for the first time, make sure you take out the rubber gasket in the top or moisture will get caught in there. Dry well and replace the gasket. Fabulous value for a great look and clean lines in the pantry. Like that they are clear and not opaque like some others I found here on Amazon. Even though they have labels, it's nice to see how much product you have with just a quick look!"
"** Update: I was contacted by the seller a few days after emailing them. They‚Äôre sending me a replacement lid and the customer service rep was very helpful. I would recommend this product based on their customer service alone. **  I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to open up all the containers yet but so far the second bunch I opened one of the lids came damaged. I contacted the seller the other day and haven‚Äôt heard from them yet so I‚Äôll update when/if they respond.  These containers are nice, I bought them on a sale and wouldn‚Äôt have paid full price for them just because I feel like it‚Äôs kind of pricey for plastic. The lids do end up taking more space than expected since you can‚Äôt line up the containers flush together. The sizes are decent for what I need them for but I wouldn‚Äôt get them if you buy a lot of bulk items unless you‚Äôre okay with using multiple containers for one type of item.  Although there are some issues, they are easy to clean and the seal does come out of the lid easily if you have long nails or a toothpick. I would make sure the lid was 100% dry before using or you might catch unwanted moisture between the lid and the seal."
"This was exactly what I needed to finally get my cupboards organized. It was impossible to find anything in the messy pile of opened, half used, bags and boxes of food. Now I can see and get to everything in my cupboard. In the future, I will probably only the two middle sizes, since those were the ones I really needed more than the others. I also ordered some of the really big containers for my bulk stuff.  Pros: These really are airtight. They are easy to clean because the little gasket that makes them airtight comes out of the lid for washing and drying. The lids are universal, which is convenient. It comes with the labels and markers. The labels are sturdy and reusable, just wipe the marker off with a damp cloth. One set of these was almost enough to reorganize all my cupboards.  Cons: The tall containers are really tall. I had to readjust the shelves in my cupboard. I wish these were as deep as the cabinets, but instead I have them in the cupboard two-deep."
"First, these are great quality. Sturdy, airtight and easy to use at a good price. My 3 star rating is because it is difficult to know the size of these containers. I had wanted to use these on a 12‚Äù shelf in my pantry and these are jus a smidge (1/2‚Äù too tall. I never saw a height for these on the sight- only the package dimensions and the volume they contain. I assumed they would be about as tall as the spaghetti. That leaves about 2‚Äù above the spaghetti & more room for the spaghetti to shift around. I‚Äôd love to order more from this company but the size of containers is important to maximize the space in my cupboard."
"I rarely write reviews as there tends to be many others already there and mine would just get lost in the pile but after receiving my storage containers I was very happy and pleased with the product that I am taking the time to write. I will admit, I was most attracted to the quantity of containers for the great price. I just assumed they were going to be thin and cheap but I wasn't looking for anything heavy duty that would get constant daily use so I wasn't too concerned. When I received the shipment, there was a very good looking sturdy designed box that had safety seal stickers which indicated if the package was ever opened, so I know I was not getting a returned item. The carton instantly made the product look like I was getting quality. The effort and expense to package plastic containers this well wasn't necessary. Upon opening the box, all the containers were stacked and while a little difficult to separate, each were wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent any scratches. The capacity of each container worked out almost exactly to match the boxes of pasta I was putting them in there so I was able to save a lot of room in my cabinet stacking the containers. The lids closed tight and the snap seemed strong and secure, like it will not break off after a few times of flexing it. There was a bonus in there too with label stickers, marking pen and measuring spoons, coupons for future orders and a nice note from the family owners of the business. Overall I very pleased with my purchase and would definitely buy the same brand again when I need more. I highly recommend these containers for the great quality and price. I was a great deal!"
"I purchased these containers and was a little leary about how they'd look and whether or not they'd be enough to contain everything that I needed to put in them in my pantry. Yesterday I sorted through most of my pantry and I was SO happy that these containers worked out perfectly! They're dishwasher safe, which is great. After I was sure they were thoroughly dry, I put my dry goods (cereal, crackers etc) in them and organized the top of my pantry. It not only held everything I needed it to, I have plenty of containers left over to work on the rest of my pantry and/or fridge. They look great, they're very easy to use, and they seem air tight. I love the little chalkboard labels and white pen that they come with. Super easy to use and it looks really cute. I read some of the reviews that said they have an odor, but they don't. They aren't clear per se, but they're ""frosted"" so although you can see through them, they're not perfectly clear, which is ok with me. Shipping was super fast and everything came in intact, nothing broken or missing. There was a nice note from the sellers also, guaranteeing 100% satisfaction. I would definitely order from this company again and would order these containers again. I highly recommend them if you're an organizer like me."
"I never have the time to write reviews but I had to write one for this because this product has made me soooo happy!!! I wish I took a before photo but let‚Äôs just day it was a mess in my pantry. I have a tiny pantry and just piled everything in there. Making it hard for me to find things and worst of all, forgetting things I had already bough to the point they‚Äôd gone bad and I didn‚Äôt even realize until I decided to do this overhaul.  This activity was actually fun. My four year old daughter helped me transfer boxes and packets into these storage containers (Full disclosure I had been using the cereal containers from a different company for some time already).  The snapping kids are great and easy for even my four year old to operate. I love that the labels can be rewritten depending on what you buy next. Just wipe with a little water and it‚Äôs good as new and ready for whatever new product is inside.  This has transformed my pantry and I can clearly see what I have and what I‚Äôm running low on. Dramatically changed my pantry and it is a must for tiny pantry‚Äôs like mine.  I recommend getting this large set as it was perfect for almost everything in my pantry. This is the best investment to start your pantry storage then if you need more you can buy the smaller sets. But if you start with those you‚Äôll likely need more and could wind up spending more as you try to piece it together.  I also got a can rack from another company and the door rack was previously installed by the last homeowner so I used that to put my bottles and sauce packets. This pairs well with wire shelf liners too for a seamless and solid foundation. You guys have a customer for life in me. Thank you!!!"
"I gave this product three stars because I was super disappointed to receive one of the tallest containers broken. These long ones were the very reason that I purchased the set and now I have to throw one away. They were also smaller than they looked in the photos. On the positive side, I can definitely find good use for these storage containers. I especiallylike the airtight covers. I just hate the fact that I lost one of my favorite ones. Wish I could get it replaced but I live in Trinidad. It will cost me more to send it back!  Update I have to raise the stars on my review of this product. I reached out to the seller via email with pictures of the damages to the containers received. I was pleasantly surprised to hear back within hours from the seller who resent an entire set for me. The set is in great condition and I could not be more pleased with their service. They really do care about their customers. Thank you so much for resolving this matter!"
"I have had these circular, pink canisters since I graduated from college in 1994. They've been fine except that they aren't air tight. Being almost fifty (GASP), I figured it was time to up my food storeage game. I saw these and decided to take a chance. They're great; certainly air tight feature since the snapping takes a few tries to line it up and get it right. The look more sleek on my rolling pantry and certainly more grown up. I'm certainly happy with my purchase and I will probably order other sizes individually (If I can) moving foward to store other items that come in cardboard containers. #YouWontRegretIt"
"I‚Äôve bought from this company before and I‚Äôve had only great luck with them. Several of the really negative reviews said they were all the same size, but as you can see, mine are exactly as advertised with the four sizes. I‚Äôve bought their other variety which I really love that are air tight, and are made of clear, hard plastic and a totally different air tight lid, which I kind of like better. And while they‚Äôre expensive, compare them to Tupperware and they‚Äôre inexpensive. Tupperware used to be the only decent airtight storage, but they‚Äôre truly unaffordable, and they‚Äôre not even rated in the top 10. This storage company is rated at the top for air tightness, which is why I buy these in the first place ...to keep flour and perishables from getting destroyed."
I needed air tight containers to store my dry goods and these fit the bill. Great four sided lock lids def keep everything air tight which is what I needed. The shipping was quick and they all arrived Un-damaged as they were very well packed. I appreciate that the lids are universal and each lid fits all of the sizes- so no hunting for the right size lid. I also like the reusable chalk pen and labels. It allows me to put the product expiration date on each one so I know how fresh it is. Having the dry goods stored this way also helps me see what we already have in stock - we were sadly buying what we already had so this makes it easy to see what we have and what we need. These are very sturdy and great quality and really are air tight. The fact that they are stackable is a huge plus for saving storage space.
"These are comparable to the lock and lock storage containers. The largest size, in my opinion are not large enough for flour, cornmeal, or cereal, but they are large enough for rice, dried beans, pasta, etc. This set is not for warehouse club shoppers. But, if you buy normal sized packages from the grocery store this set will accommodate most items and for the number of containers you get, the price isn‚Äôt bad. The quality appears to be good, the lids are interchangeable, and the depth is exactly the same which makes for a great presentation as well as good functionality. I would buy this set again, even with the $70 price tag."
"(Quick disclaimer: The labels used in the photo are not the labels included with the containers. I had ordered them without realizing the set came with its own and, because I had already used them for other organizers in my home I decided to use them for these as well. The labels included fit the size of these containers much better) okay now that‚Äôs over, I love these. My partner complained that he doesn‚Äôt like the taper at the end bc it feels like wasting space when they don‚Äôt fit perfectly. I disagree, primarily due to the height of the shelf I put cereal on. I like being able to get my fingers between them at the bottom to slide them out. I don‚Äôt wanna reach all the way to the top so I can tip it towards me. To each their own, but I think they‚Äôre pretty perfect, the seal hasn‚Äôt failed me yet and aesthetically I love not having so many boxes turned every which way so I can‚Äôt see the labels. It‚Äôs great. If I ever need more I‚Äôll probably get more of the same set."
"These containers are an organizer-freak‚Äôs dream. There are 24 containers, all plastic, rectangle, 4 different sizes but the lids are all the same size - which is so nice!  Being plastic means they won‚Äôt break easily and they‚Äôre not too heavy and don‚Äôt overweigh my shelving in my apartment pantry.  I loved the chalk stickers and how easy it was to write and erase on them.  It was a bit difficult to get the tops on at first, and a few of the containers were stuck together when I took them out of the box. But thankfully, my husband was able to fix that! The tops get easier too.  10/10 recommend if you‚Äôre crazy about being organized! Can‚Äôt beat the price for the amount you get."
""
"Economical, seem to be pretty sturdy. Disappointed because the do not look like the picture and in the description they say they are CLEAR! As you can see they are not."
"Love these containers more than I thought I would. Great quality, clean and organized look. The lids are all the same size so that's a great thing. No having to search for matching container/lid combo."
"My 17yr son is, probably, a bit on the OCD side of organization and desperately wanted a ""tiktok"" kitchen...basically an obsessively organized kitchen. He threw what he wanted in the cart and mommy slipped the bank card. I was super impressed with these, in particular. The are air tight, not too bad to look at, sturdy or stable or whatever you want to call it, and all the different sizes are perfect for organizing a pantry! I am buying a second set for my oldest who just bought her first house!"
""
"The lids fit all containers, and that delights my hubby. He hates searching through lids to find the right one. I liked them so much, I bought two more sets from this company. They stack nicely, and the range of sizes works perfectly. I appreciate how well they are packed for shipping, nothing is broken or stuck together. We understand the snugness from the bags is necessary to keep the plastic from bonding to each other. A great value,and I recommend."
"When we moved into this house, I was so concerned about our tiny pantry since our previous pantry was almost twice the size. Finding items and storing items was a challenge. I purchased 3 items to fix the problem: a can rack, an over the door shelf system, and these storage bins. Hands down the best purchase for immediate relief of the chaos in our tiny pantry were these storage bins!!!! #1 - They are transparent so you see what you have. #2 - They are stackable and equal in width. #3- They come with labels. You may not fully understand how much space product packaging takes up in your pantry until you get rid of it. After my first day organizing our pantry, I had a whole row with almost nothing on it. I plan to buy more of these containers in the future after figuring the sizes I will need."
"This airtight food storage container set is an incredible buy. I love it! It is airtight to keep things fresh inside. The lids snap into place. A few had a tight fit at first, but overall it was all good.  I‚Äôve recently gone through my entire kitchen and between this and a few other sets of various sizes, I have moved nearly all I have into these stackable containers. That includes things in the refrigerator, too. It was hard to keep shelves and cupboards clean with kids in the house, but with these there is almost no mess to be made. It is easier to find things, too. The clean shelves give me peace of mind. Also, these are clear so it is obvious when I am running low on something - and much easier to make a grocery list.  The sizes of this particular set were really useful and I would definitely buy it again if I have need for more. It was a good value."
"These are very sturdy, inexpensive and clear enough to see what‚Äôs in them. They come with labels so you can see what you have. Lids fit nice and tight. I wasn‚Äôt able to use all the tall ones as we don‚Äôt eat cereal or a lot of pasta but I‚Äôm sure I can find another use for them. I‚Äôm quite satisfied with my purchase."
"I purchased this set with the idea of getting my pantry in order. What I wasn't expecting was the number of containers, the quality and durability of same.  The lids fit tight, so if you have dexterity issues, be advised. The snaps are tight, not snug.  The entire set were easily cleaned and I had no difficulty in separating them prior to handwashing the entire set.  If you are looking for a durable set that can be used anywhere in the home (I have some in the bathroom) it is worth checking these out."
"I completely reorganized my pantry & I am in love with how it turned out, these containers helped me save so much space. I bought these & another set (from the same store) with larger containers so I could get everything organized & it turned out beautifully. The containers all showed up in perfect condition, I was worried because some of the reviews said they had cracked our broken containers but I had no issues with any of mine, they did come with the labels & marker but I chose not to use them. The containers seem to be of good quality too, they seem sturdy & airtight, they are a little oddly shaped in my opinion but I don‚Äôt mind that much. Overall, very pleased with my purchase & thrilled with how my pantry looks now!"
"I needed help in my pantry and these containers have made it look so much better in there. Everything is so much more organized than before. They have labels that you can write what is on each one. The lids have an awesome seal to them. I store my chips in them and I have not had to throw out any due to them getting stale. I was afraid there would be a smell, but they are great! I do want to get another set in the future."
"Love these containers for our pantry. I know people have complain that they aren‚Äôt truly clear, but that doesn‚Äôt really bother me. They are clear enough to see what‚Äôs inside. I prefer having sturdy containers for flours, sugars and other baking ingredients over trying to scoop out of the bag, and it keeps the ingredients fresher longer. My only concern is that the lid locks feel a little flimsy. I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to evaluate if they will break off, but so far these are great and the price was better than many others I looked at."

I was having problems with little weevils getting in pasta and rice. These are airtight and I think they were a great value for the amount. They are not as clear as shown in the photo though.
I love them but they came broken so I got in contact with the manufacture to see if they can replace them so we will see!!! So update I contacted the company and they resolved my issue and I love this storage containers they fit perfectly in my pantry and now have so much more space in my pantry I love them and I also like that they can be flipped upside down for more room!!!!
"Very sturdy and easy to clean. You can easily take out the rubber seal and clean it, also Very easy to reinstall. As for the container themselves I'm very happy. The labels are nice but the pen for writing leave something to be desired and to me they are a bonus anyway so no harm no foul. I may buy more and they are great for gifts."
If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs easy to clean and uniformed looking this is it. They aren‚Äôt 100% crystal clear but they aren‚Äôt cloudy. They are airtight and hold on liquid also. I use one of them to store my beans In the fridge for the week and it doesn‚Äôt leak. The rubber seal comes off the lid for cleaning also. When you first get them they are a little tough to get them apart but with a little common sense and using the paper between them they slide out with no struggle needed.
"These are perfect and have helped my organize my pantry area so much better than it was! No, they are not as clear as in the photos, but I honestly don't even notice, I'm so happy with the organization and being able to see everything that I have now! Highly recommend! Only wish there were more smaller ones in the set, but I'll likely be ordering more anyway!!!"
This is an update to my review yesterday. I love the products and I'm very satisfied. It make my cabinets more rooms and organized. When I received my ordered yesterday I'm very excited but the exciment turn into disappointment when I found out that one of the files of the containers are all damaged. So I chat with their costume service regardings the problems and they very helpful. I was so amazed how fast they send the replacement. They send me another sets of the containers within 24 hours. They make my day completed. So excited to finishing my organization. Great products with excellent costumer service. It's worth it! Definitely recommend it to my family and friends. Thank you so much for the immediate action. I loved it!
"You‚Äôll love these. They‚Äôre sturdy, great sizes, & of extreme importance to me - the closing mechanism on the tops of these are superior because they close completely, you listen for the click as each side closes, & you know your product inside is protected & airtight. An organized pantry is such a beautiful thing!"
"These made my baking cabinet look like a dream! They all have the same size lid which makes them so easy to fill. I love the labels but I used a paint marker instead of the provided chalk marker, which I found to be too light. I had a smaller set of the pricier containers but they are honestly too heavy to move in and out of the cabinet all the time. These are sturdy but lightweight at the same time. They have a nice airtight seal. I‚Äôm thrilled with this purchase! Really satisfied my need for getting my life together, one cabinet at a time."
I got mine delivered today and put them to use tonight! I absolutely love them! It was so satisfying to organize my pantry! Although there were 4 of them that were chipped. Nothing major. Just around the outside rim. No cracks or anything that would let air in. Kinda sucks for the price but you can‚Äôt really notice. I will definitely be buying more!ü§û
"These are great for storing food items such as dry pasta, brown sugar, etc. They seal air tight and come with labels you can apply. My only complaint is the containers are dishwasher safe but because of rubber seal the lids have to be hand washed. I would purchase these again."
"Definitely hard to get apart, I just ran hot water on the side for less than a minute. That way the inside of the containers don't get wet. Not as big as I thought they would be but great for snack boxes sizes and the smallest ones are good for nuts, raisins etc"
"I purchased the 24 piece set Saturday got them on Sunday and organized the pantry. They are easy to use perfect for all remotes of food. Very glad I bought them! I‚Äôm going to get more of different sizes for cereal, oats, sugar, flour etc. would recommend!"

I had an infestation of pantry moths and they are horrible! So I ordered these to keep our food sealed and free of their nasty larvae. Life saver!!! I‚Äôm going to order more. I love that they come with labels and my pantry looks amazing and organized. My kids freaked out when they saw how neat it was. 100% recommend!!!
This is the 2 nd time I hav purchased these. I have them in my pantry. I also have them in my baking area. I will be using these in my new fridge when it comes too.
I got these to organize my cabinets and to start putting my chips in because my boyfriend has a bad habit of leaving the bag open . We LOVE them!! You can write on them with the sticker & marker they give you ! They look so much better than a bunch of chip bags laying around! We use it for so much more than chips though! Definitely recommend !
Love how my pantry looks with these. The different size varieties are great. They snap on & off very easily. Great for snacks for my kids. I did not use the stick on labels since it‚Äôs obvious what‚Äôs inside
I bought these during black Friday sale. Def worth it. I've had an issues with those grain moths. I like that they are all rectangular and airtight with 4 way clamps on the lid.
Love how these made my cabinet space more organized. It‚Äôs so much easier to find what I need.
This is exactly what my folks needed to keep their dry goods fresh and not get stale. Easy snap on/off tops. Definitely recommend üòä
"The products are definitely super cute, clear just like I like it. The only downside is that they don‚Äôt have the same size (like the little ones of stacked are not the same size as the big one). So me and my OCD kinda don‚Äôt like this üòÇ"
"Very durable, easy to clean and very sturdy. I was doubtful that it‚Äôd be air tight but two weeks in and my cereal and snacks are just as fresh as the day I transferred them into the containers. Would recommend"
"Being away from home means critters move in and take over the pantry‚Ä¶what a mess! These are the perfect solution: affordable,sturdy,available in many sizes,and easy to clean. I‚Äôm wishing I had done this ages ago! I want to be prepared for Emergencies and these will be the way I keep the pantry full of fresh supplies."
"These containers hold up well, and the different sizes work great for different food boxes like cereal, crackers, granola, etc."
"I love these containers, just wish they were German Shepard proof. Ordered more to replace the one that got chewed Love love the labels"
Gave as Christmas gifts to daughter & granddaughter. They just loved them. Gave them more storage room in their pantries. The price was right for all the containers that you receive.
I really like this set! I marked it down ny one star under sturdiness because one unit arrived broken but overall I'm happy with the set.
I was hoping that they would be like glass clear. But they‚Äôre hazy. I still love them tho.
I like the quality of the plastic.... easy to use and looks nice with the availability to quickly see what is getting low.
I changed the look of my old pantry with this modern touch. Price of $45 is really worth.
Using these containers gave me a lot more space in the pantry! The lids are super sturdy. Love the labels and white pen.
These are amazing well worth the money. My cabinet looks simply marvelous.
Took me sometime to right the review but here goes. These containers work well I recommend my only issue being when I finally decided to open and use them long after buying them only then I realized that I got the package with two of the lids damaged
The lids seem to be very durable. Only suggestion is to include a better chalk pen for the labels
Love the way it fits in my cabinets and I'm able to organize so much stuff with it.
Love the assortment of sizes and different types of stickers for labeling if you choose to do so. Makes it easy for my kids to refill and keep track of what we are low on for shopping
These have made rearranging my mudroom a breeze. They hold almost anything you need to store.
I live in an RV so the pantry is TINY!! This really helped me utilize the vertical space i have and left plenty of room in front of the containers for things like cans and peanut butter. Now i can grab things without everything else toppling over. So happy i bought this!
"I used this container set to store spices, powders & different lentils. Labels are great & being clear plastic is very helpful. Pleased with this set."
Excellent value for the number of containers that are included. I would definitely order again from this company.
I love the airtight lids and the slender containers. They fit in tight spaces. The labels make them so much prettier
They really keep food fresh and I like the size of the containers
This product has been perfect. It stores food and keeps it safe from bugs. I thought the smallest size container might be too small but it actually is the perfect size for the contents from a box of noodles or bag of nuts. A whole box of cereal fits in the tallest size containers. They are clear and not foggy. Everything came as expected! Very happy with my purchase.
Love the freshness lick on the lid
Great product. I actually ended up buying more because they are very versatile.
Reasonably priced and soooooo handy in my pantry!
I'm in love...real love lol ‚ù§Ô∏è buy it!
Works great. Seems to be keeping my food fresh. Not clear not the picture. Works great.
Good quality. Everything fits securely and is well organized
"Muy pr√°cticos, eficientes hermetismo de la tapa. Muy buena calidad del material."
Couldn't have asked for something better to organize the pantry.
Absolutely love these! Did not regret this purchase. Buy it! Don‚Äôt think about it.
"Great product, good for organizing and keeps food fresh."
Have been able to organize my pantry to hold more items and being able to select at a glance is great.
"Loved the set , very practical and loved the idea of having the measurements at the sides of the containers"
I was wanting to organize my pantry and this set is exactly what I was looking for. Fits nicely in the pull out drawers. I also purchased another set from a different manufacture for my flours and sugars. I had previously decided that the largest containers in this set would not be large enough to hold a 5lb bag of sugar or flour. I‚Äôm glad I stuck with my decision in combining the two different sets. Everything fits well and is all organized. Very pleased how it turned out. Quality of this set is good and the locking lids work well. They seal well and are easy to open and close.
"Perfect for everything. Various sizes, easy to clean and use. Makes everything look organized and clean. Best product and love the labels they come with."
These containers are great. I love the different sizes that came in the box. They look small but they hold alot. The price is a little bit on the high side but they worked great. If you want to get organized then buy these contain
Redone and organized my pantry.. these made it super fun easy and successful..
I loved the air tight lids and their durability. The amount of containers for the cost were awesome had enough to share with a family member. I wish a few of them could of been wider than tall other than that I would recommend these containers to someone else. They would also make a great gift.
I have ordered this one and really like the quality of this product. Its strong and air tight is good too.
"Looks like these are clear from the photos, but they are a little cloudier."
These containers are great for keeping food safe from pests and keeping it fresh
"I got these to keep cereal, rice, sugar, flour, etc in my pantry. They seem sturdy and look great too. It's a win-win."
These storage containers are great I'm in the process of redoing my pantry and I love these containers just enough for everything I have and the quality is perfect will definitely be buying more
"Me gusto mucho el producto , lo volveria a comprar."
"Works well, looks great!"
They minimize space so they‚Äôre great
"Exactly what I wanted. They are so handy and many sizes that fit everything. Easy to use, secure lids. Completely satisfied."
Love these! Makes organizing easy
Great containers!!!
Love these!
Llegaron en buen estado los productos .
I like everything about them. Mostly the variety of sizes and durability.
Love the organization with these and keeps food fresh.
Very nice set. Unfortunately 3 pieces arrived broken. The box was also damaged. The larger box it was in was not damaged.

There are no large and extra large containers. I received 20 of the smallest and 3 of the next smallest.
Wish they were clear. Used for dry food in my pantry.
Disappointed they don‚Äôt hold a box of cereal!
Super small. Way smaller than described. I measured them and they are not the size described. I returned
Is not clear containers like the pictures advertise. One came broken.
Well I wanted something for my flour and sugar and they said that‚Äôs what it was for and you cannot fit a bag of either in the containers.i thought they were bigger
Demaciados peque√±os
Product is by far misleading this product is much smalller than it shows on display. don‚Äôt spend your money on this product
"When our pantry gets messy it drives me bonkers. Not only can I never find what I need, but the look of it is enough to induce a bit of anxiety. I had ordered some storage containers but my last order was not enough to allow me to actually store and organize all of the food I wanted to. So, I decided to grab this set.  This comes with a total of 32 storage containers in various sizes ranging from tall to very small. The storage containers stack well which makes organization just that much easier. They lock easily, the fits and seals are all great and air tight. I also love that this set comes with chalkboard labels and a liquid chalk marker so you can label your containers. The amount of happiness this brought me when I saw how clean and organized my pantry looked was immeasurable. As another bonus these ago come with measuring spoons in a rainbow of colors which my daughter promptly claimed as her own.  Overall this is a great set that comes with quite a few containers, labels, and marker. If you're looking to really get your pantry and drawers organized, this set makes a great option."
"We have been buying extra flour and rice just to be safe with the war going on in Ukraine. These containers are perfect. I put flour, sugar, rice, pasta, noodles and then of course all my baking goods and these are just perfect. I love that they‚Äôre stackable.  Tons of different sizes. So you can do everything from nuts in a small container of baking soda and then you can switch to the long containers for cereal and anything really.  There are four sides for snap on lids. Each side slips underneath the plastic lip and hold tight. These are airtight. Fantastic for storing your food products.  Highly recommend for anyone looking to do any kind of food storage. They do come with the small stickers that you can write on with the included pen that is chalk. So you can actually erase them and write something different on them for later."
"I've been filling these containers up with loads of cereal, noodles, pasta, and various other ingredients and I still have containers left over. If you've got a large family then this will definitely suit your needs.  The plastic sides are thicker than I expected, it doesn't feel like the cheap thin plastic containers sold at grocery stores. The lids also feel pretty solid though I'm worried that if I put them in the dishwasher they'll warp. The box advises not dishwashing the lids so I'm probably going to stick with hand washing them.  Overall I can't really find any faults with these plastic storage containers yet. No defects when I received them and all of the containers are working as intended.  I'll update this review with a long term review in the future or if any of the containers crack/break from regular use."
"These are very good containers. They have revolutionized the organization of our kitchen and storage. I LOVE the labels they come with and as they send a bunch of them I have been able to use them on other storage items. The chalk ""pen"" it comes with is just great.  We live on the ocean and the humid air is the name of the game. Even using Mason jars the dampness gets in; clumped sugar or flour is to be expected. The tops and bottoms of these containers snap together just as you want, but this design of container is never air tight. So although nothing else can get it (i.e. mice or bugs) they are not a total solution for us.  One container came with the lip on the top and bottom broken, but that is a chance event."
"I liked the fact that no matter the size of the container they all share the same top. No having to look for the right sized top for these containers. The large ""spaghetti"" containers hold so much spaghetti... I think I put 4 1lb boxes in and still had room. A coupleof weeks ago, I obtained a similar pack of containers and love them. I have put deshelled sunflower seeds in my old containers and they haven't become stale, so I proceeded to put cereal, flour, and granola in these containers. If I were to put cookies or crackers in these, I would keep them in a ziploc baggie just to be safe. I will definitely continue to use them as pantry organizers."
"I had a cabinet full of five or six types of containers, all with lids just different enough to fool me into thinking they go with the container I'd be trying to close. I've tried multiple brands over the years, and as the lids break or the containers got discolored from pasta sauces, etc., I ended up with a random hodgepodge of container chaos. I LOVE these containers!! The lids are the same, so they match every single container. The containers themselves are sturdy, they have a firm lock even for soups and sauces, they stack well and they clean up nicely. The little chalkboard labels are very cute and a nice bonus. Very happy with this set!"
"These storage containers can stack nicely with each other when not in use. They also stack okay when filled. Their lids seal tightly and their tall shape makes them easy to fit into smaller spaces. I find these handy not just for food but for small electronic accessories and similar things.  The black labels and white marker this set comes with is more useful than you might realize at first. You might think you will remember but you'll probably forget if it was dry milk or powdered sugar or corn starch. For those type of dry ingredients, there is a slight inconvenience that many measuring cups just won't be able to scoop from these very easily."
I got these to use in my new kitchen I am moving in to. This is my second set of this brand.  I want clean and streamlined as well as practical and functional. I love how they perfectly stack with each other and feel steady ontop of each other. They feel like they would not be easily knocked over.  The set feels very sturdy. It is easy to snap the lids on and they feel very secure. It comes with the black label stickers and a white chalk marker to write on the labels so you can see and read what is in the container. It also comes with a set of scooping spoons.  I would buy this set again.
"I am using these to store dry good in my pantry. So far I am very pleased. I find them very easy to open and close. Occasionally I have had flours and such that have brought pantry moths into my home. By placing all of the items in these containers it isolates any contaminated items and keeps the problem from spreading. These moths can also com in from the outside, so storing items in these containers prevents the moths, or other pests, from contaminating anything stored in them.  Five stars."
"I ordered this set because I have a small pantry. My goal was to have the space organized and maximized. The containers are stackable which made my goal easy to accomplished. The containers themselves are very sturdy and the lids snap on tightly. As I was washing them (which they're easily cleaned) I thought the containers looked small but they all fit more than expected. I am really pleased and happy with this product, would highly recommend."
"I love the variety of sizes, and that they are stackable and basically the same footprint, with some taller and some shorter. This makes it so my tallest and the shorter ones - stacked - look very tidy next to each other. The seals are secure and easy to work. Labels stick well. The tallest ones don't fit in most of my shelves, but I do have a couple places that do work, so maybe measure your space to be sure it makes sense for you."
"The most wonderful thing about this set of containers is that they have the same base dimensions, so all the lids are the same. This is so much easier than dealing with different diameters and sizes of containers and lids. They arrived well packaged and without damage. I like the variety of the sizes, only differing from one another by how deep the container is. I liked these so much, I ordered another set."
"Literally just got these in, but wanted to go ahead and give my first impressions as there are two minor issues I‚Äôve found. 1. Conflicting information about being dishwasher safe. On one side of the product packaging on one side it says this is dishwasher safe, but then on the other side it says the lids are NOT dishwasher safe, and placing in the dishwasher could ruin the integrity of the containers. So I guess place just place the bins in the dishwasher, but we will just hand wash everything because my husband doesn‚Äôt have the attention span to remember that lids vs containers have different wash instructions. 2. As instructed I hand washed the lids, and water got trapped under the black seal. Very frustrating trying to get the water out of the lid. I ended up just setting those I had already washed aside and not submersing the rest in water to wash. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend storing ‚Äúsoup‚Äù like the product description says you can because it will get trapped in the lid.  The bins are see through, but slightly frosted. Easy to see the product, but don‚Äôt expect a totally clear view. Love the variety of sizes, the quantity of bins, and that these aren‚Äôt too big. While we have a pantry, the shimmed are not overly deep. These containers are perfect as they fit in the shelf without touching the edge. Kids fit securely, no defects, everything arrived wrapped, and clean. Overall I like these, but they need to make up their mind about the dishwasher. It‚Äôs either do or do not in our household."
I believe for this year number of storage containers that you get this is a fantastic value I did put water in one of them and did not get it to leak they were easy to rinse out and clean prior to usage also they seem pretty airtight to me  Overall this is a fantastic deal for the number of containers you get for food storage that are of good quality.
"I love having the different size air tight containers to store items in my pantry and they stack...love that. I was excited because they go in the freezer. It's a win-win. Labels measuring spoons are included, it a bonus to be able to label the containers. You may have different types or brands of spaghetti, the labels will come in handy. Recommend"
"So many containers I don‚Äôt even know what to do with them! So many sizes, love how the one lid fits every single container no matter the size. Stackable, easy to open and clean and just everything I wanted and needed. Comes with labels and a marker and could be used around the house for organizing just not food but for whatever you may need"
"These containers are great for just about anything you need to store! So far they seem to be okay in the dishwasher, I just take the silicone seals out and put them back after the containers dry. These are a lot like the Lock & Lock containers available from QVC, just much less expensive."
""
"This many containers in this many sizes at this price makes this a good bargain, especially because the containers are actually pretty sturdy and the airtight seal actually works. They even pass the liquid test.  The snap-on lids fit nice and secure. No matter the size of the container, they are ALL stackable with one another, which is fantastic. With five different sizes, it's pretty easy to find a size that fits your needs.  They're fairly sturdy, too. They ARE breakable if you abuse them -- stepping on them or dropping them with heavy contents inside -- but by and large you can drop them from your counter and they'll be fine.  Note that the taller ones are a bit of a pain to clean unless you have small hands.  Otherwise, big thumbs up! This is a great deal!"
It is wedding season and every registry for weddings we've been invited to has had these containers on them. This set has a really nice number of pieces for organization. Items stored are clearly visible and the included labels are a nice touch.
I am really happy with these containers. They come in different sizes and are stackable. The airtight lids helps keep food fresh. I love that it brings a chalk marker and labels. To erase the names on the labels just wipe with a damp cloth.
"I used these to transform the collection of disparate containers and random packages in my pantry into something much more organized and compact. They are airtight as promised so they're excellent for food storage. The containers seem relatively sturdy, but I don't know if they'll survive any strong impact. I've had similar containers that crack when dropped (especially if they have something heavy like flour or sugar in them) so I think despite being plastic and less prone to breaking than glass, one has to be careful.  These were easy to clean except the lids. They have deep-seated rubber seals which are great to create an airtight seal, but getting them to dry takes some time and effort. I wouldn't wash these in a dishwasher (I washed all of mine by hand) for fear of detergent making them cloudy or the jostling cracking them, but they don't have to be washed super often so that wasn't a big issue for me.  The labels seem to be made of vinyl and can be erased and re-written on, though they need to be removed for cleaning once applied. I don't know how many times they can be removed and replaced before they won't stick anymore, but a full sheet of extra labels is included. The pen wrote on the labels well enough, but it seems to be on the dry side and I don't know if it'll last beyond the initial labeling.  The only issue I had with these is that they are specifically designed for pantry use, but the mouths of all of the containers aren't large enough to comfortably fit a cup-sized measuring cup. You have to either pour from the top (which is awkward and messy) or use multiple measures which are smaller than a full cup. Other than that, I'm very pleased with this set and find it to be good value."
"Just look at these pictures and see for yourself. What a difference!  These are amazing quality. Strong containers and tough covers. What I love most about these containers is that all of the lids are the same size. So for one, they‚Äôre easily stackable, and two, you‚Äôre less likely to have mismatched and unusable containers/lids.  These are stackable, but they‚Äôre not securely stackable. So I wouldn‚Äôt recommend stacking heavy containers one on top of each other.  These are very tightly sealed, keeping food fresher for longer, as well as preventing crawlers from getting in.  Get this, and you will spend hours staring at your pantry in awe over the transformation!"
"Good value at the just under fifty dollar price tag.  Comes with more of the larger sizes than many sets.  Not a huge fan of the lids, for two reasons. I know that the flap things eventually wear out from previous sets like this and my family is often too lazy to close all four sides.  But if you want to try out using this sort of container, these are a great value for the price."
Containers are air-tight and lids snap on easily. Everything stacks together very nice and tightly. Great way to organize my limited pantry space. Labels are nice and peel off if needed.
"You get a lot of containers, so its a good deal. I just expected the bigger containers to be a bit bigger. They aren't even big enough to hold my cereal, which is the reason i got em."
"This air tight food storage is a great set, it is a great set, it keeps everything safe and airtight and it‚Äôs kept us organized. We love that factor and you can label everything too!"
"If you want to organize your pantry, these will help! The lids lock on all 4 sides & are all the same size, so there‚Äôs none of that matching thing - they all fit. Some information says dishwasher safe, but I prefer to hand wash - especially the lids with the tracks & edges where water can hide.  The assortment of sizes is excellent & the quantity is, too. They‚Äôre not clear, but more opaque which is fine. Under $50 for 28 containers is kind of a steal!  **Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it‚Äôs Helpful!** üòä"
Air tight and easy to use. These are fantastic and easy to stack/see. All the lids are the same size so finding what you need is easier.
"Is it clear? No, they're a bit cloudy.  Are they dishwasher safe? Sort of. The bottoms are, the lids are not (and two of the bigger sizes didn't fit anyway, so I hand-washed them).  Are they leak-proof? I'm not positive. The lids easily retain moisture, so I could see that getting dicey.  All that being said, they look nice once they're full of food. I needed some thin containers for my non-standard open shelving, and this set had the perfect height and width to them. My cupboard was completely full before, and now there's nearly an entire full shelf (plus I have some leftover containers!) Can't recommend it enough, but keep the caveats I posted in mind if those things matter to you."
"For nearly all of my adult life, I was simply getting Gladware or Ziplock, letting them slowly deteriorate over the course of a few months, recycling them (or losing them), lather rinse repeat. It finally occurred to me to splurge on some good ones. I'm not one to review things very often, let alone food storage containers, but here we are. I've been so impressed and satisfied with these in just a few months that I feel compelled to tell y'all about them. They're super airtight, the plastic is crystal clear, and they've each been through the wash a dozen times with no particular sign of wear and tear yet. Usually by this point, the Ziplocs are cloudy, warped, have holes, etc. But these guys, they just keep ticking. We've put soup directly in them, frozen them, you name it. Worth the extra few bucks to keep a few more items out of the landfill."
"This is my 3rd set because I ADORE them! Tight fit, stack perfectly in my fridge, freeze well, microwave well with vented sides when latches are up! They have been dropped, tipped over and quite frankly brutally beaten up by my crew and I haven't cracked or broken one to date! Even better the lids store well! Honestly the best containers I've owned! (Gazes in to cabinet and realizes adulting is weird when you are this excited to review plastic containers ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)"
"I loved these so much that I ordered a second set. They are leak proof for me to haul my lunch around and really easy to clean because they go in the dishwasher. Plus they cut the cord between me and the plastic ware that would tumble out onto my head any time I opened the darn cupboard! Using them I have a couple of ""Iearnings""....first, when planning to put in the freezer, make sure you leave plenty of room for your food to expand (see picture; second, some foods put out a gas (I've noticed ths especially with berries) and they can pop the lock after a few days if left alone. That means that you need to eat your berries every day, right?! Seriously, these are great and I've noticed no discoloration with use."
"I tossed all my old containers because they kept staining, retaining smell, and would be ‚Äúmicrowavable‚Äù but when I microwaved food in them the plastic would warp and bubble. These do none of that! They are incredibly easy to clean and don‚Äôt retain smell. My boyfriend put a red sauce in two of the smallest containers and they got lost in the fridge for over a month. They cleaned up really easy. Also, it doesn‚Äôt spill at all thanks to the clips on the side. I‚Äôm buying another set after this review!"
I sent this to one of my adult daughters. She was shocked. She was going to buy some containers when they arrived. She loves them. I have 3 of the larger ones I bought a Costco when they came out. They were dirt cheap then. This set is a good value. I keep crackers in mine and they really seal and stay fresh. I bought some for the boat and moisture dies not get in. I love the good Rubbermaid. I have 3 huge sets with the good lids. Love they way they stack. I have used Tupperware for 50 years. Bought most of it in the thrift stores. It does not hold a candle to Rubbermaid. I sent the Tupperware home with the kids and grand kids. The great grand kids are still at home. It is one way to get rid of my Tupperware. LOL
"these seal up great, far superior to other brands on the market i have used, update on my previous review, after 6 months of use, normal cleaning never dropped or thrown around. The plastic is stress fracturing along the sides and bottom and cracking around the corners"
"I originally liked the product a lot, and it worked well for my needs. Unfortunately after about 1 year of normal to light use--almost all five lids are leaking due to cracks. One to three pieces 3 or four times a week. Washed in the dishwasher used for an adult's lunch. Supposedly this has a lifetime warrantee. I will be contacting the manufacture to attempt to get a replacement or a refund."
Poor durability. Very disappointed because these containers lock and seal very well. Took lid out of the drawer today and the entire thing is cracked. Never put in dishwasher or microwave. Seems to have shattered inside the plastic from pressing the lid onto the container.
"I have now ordered 3 sets of these and thrown all other containers in the trash.  Simply. they spoil you for anything else. Will go from freezer to microwave by just flipping the side catches to release the steam. As you remove portions, just move remainder to next smaller size and pop this one in the dishwasher.  Sturdy. Air tight. Stack beautifully in both the cupboard and refer. Will last a lifetime.  I could go on for hours extolling their virtues."
"We bought one 10-piece set of these. After using them for a while we got another set and tossed a bunch of older containers. Let me list the advantages of these: . can be used in the microwave - direct refrigerator to microwave . seal very well . transparent to see what is inside . clean up perfectly in the dishwasher . have not (yet, at least) gotten any stains from things like tomato sauce  They are much more versatile than any plastic containers we had before and we don't worry about edges chipping like with glass containers we have used.  These really meet all of our needs for food storage."
"Originally I bought a couple of these containers to use with my lunchbag for daily lunches. Other containers leak, or have lids that pop off unexpectedly, or tend to stain and age poorly. These containers are more expensive, but in my opinion, well worth the premium.  The containers are substantial... even when full, they don't bend or flex like cheaper alternatives. The lids seal tightly, but are easy to open and close. The hinged locks on either side of the lid also contain vents that expell air when the lid is closed, and function as a vent when reheating items in the microwave. Simply lift up the locks and put the item in the microwave to reheat without fear of popping, splattering or dripping. The lid also helps to keep the heat in and heat your items more quickly.  I regularly carry homemade soups and pasta for lunch. I've never experienced any leak or problem. After many, many uses, the containers look just like new. They've not stained or aged in any way... they don't even show any scratches or marring from use. The fact that they're perfectly clear means that you can finally know exactly what's in that container in the refrigerator... no more guessing. I've purchased several more of these containers in a variety of sizes, eliminating the cheap containers altogether from my pantry."
"If I could give this product 10 stars I would! I have never had containers that I love so much. It's crazy that a set of containers can make me so happy but it will do the same for you when you get them. Perfect shape...they don't stain or smell, they stack so beautifully in the cabinet....you can use them for anything and everything and I do! I have literally gotten rid of every single other container I have and replaced them with these and I still want to buy more."
"These containers are absolutely perfect!  When I make dinner, I portion out leftovers into the small 1.3 cup containers, write the date on the top in chalk pen, and pop them in the freezer. They're the perfect size to bring with me to work for lunch, and being able to grab them out of the freezer, put them straight into my lunchbox, and then pop them into the microwave for lunch is super convenient! I haven't had any issues with freezer burn or the containers getting too hot at all! I've actually purchased two additional packs of just these size because they're just so perfect! I have about 20 of them all together now.  The medium 3.2 cup containers are also a great size! I portion out veggies for the week into them, and stack them in the refrigerator, then grab one a day for snacks at work. The seal is good enough that even fruits and veggies that I chop up on Sunday night are fresh enough to bring to work on Friday, which means I'm not having to meal prep more than once a week. I've got about 8 of these.  The big 9.6 cup containers are good for preshredding chicken, freezing things like soups, stocks, or the fruits and veggies I like to blend for smoothies, and storing leftovers from big meals (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc). I don't use these ones as much.  The little tiny .5 cup ones are great for bringing sauces to work (and I've never had a spill!), Portioning out kids snacks, storing servings of precut fruits and veggies, etc. I think I'm going to buy more of these ones as well.  All of the containers are super washable, and can be pretty much be easily wiped clean with a sponge and a little bit of soap, or they're totally dishwasher safe. I've never had any melting or warping issues.  Definitely worth the price tag for these! I can see them lasting a long time!"
"Totally love these containers! Just had to order 5 more of the 3.1 cup size.  Awesome features, such as the vent holes under the latches. Seal tight with no leaking. Easy to clean. Stackable. I use them for everything from recipe prep, to freezer storage.  Five months in and they‚Äôre still like new. No staining or cracking.  Pricey but worth it.  Update 02/13/2022. Sadly, several pieces of my beloved Brilliance containers are scratched badly and I‚Äôm afraid they might crack/break completely. Just contacted Rubbermaid and hope they have some answers and resolution. Posting photos of all sides of one container.  Update 03/21/2022. Rubbermaid replaced the scratched containers. Hopefully, they‚Äôll be able to resolve whatever is causing the scratching problem, because I really love these containers."
"I gotta say I was so mad at myself when these arrived cause I thought they were meant to be glass, saying that, these are fantastic and am totally happy.  The thing I love about these is this: the fact that the seals on the lid lock in means I can put the lid on and put the chicken I just pulled apart in the fridge and leave the clips up which allows any steam ect to still get out and not make sooo much condensation, its so smart.  Anyway, I'm currently going through my container cupboards and getting rid of my older ones, I think im.even gonna buy another set cause they seriously store down to nothing, that's my 2nd fave thing. I could get 6 sets and that might take up the same space as my old ones, this set sits in itself perfectly."
"Like so many other people, over the years we've used everything from expensive storage containers to mid-grade storage containers, to take-out, Cool-Whip and butter containers in a pinch. I really didn't have high expectations of these containers when we first purchased them, but these things are amazing!! We bought our first set quite a while ago, maybe a couple of years ago or more, and they have held up amazingly well. I don't exactly treat them with kid gloves, and they are abused, dropped, slammed on the counter, thrown in the dishwasher, and used again. I haven't frozen anything in mine but they are frequently cycling through the fridge, dishwasher and back to the cabinet. I haven't had ANY cracks or leaks. We love them so much that we bought another storage set so I could get rid of all those other brand-name and odds-and-ends containers junking up my cabinets. I couldn't be happier with these containers! We like them so much that we just bought a set of the pantry storage containers to move messy things like sugar and flour into. I expect they will be every bit as amazing as this storage set!"
"I love these containers. I have had glass ones (heavy and don‚Äôt seal or store easily) a myriad of other plastic containers. I gave them all away once I found these. They stack nicely - we freeze them, dishwash them, microwave them, store all sorts of colored sauces and they don‚Äôt stain or smell. They have held up so well - I have been pleasantly surprised. The sides that snap shut can be left up to vent when heating in the microwave (that is brilliant‚Ä¶why don‚Äôt all containers do this)? I will use them to just melt butter sometimes in the microwave for recipes rather than having the butter splatter all over or try using that awkward round cover everyone has in their microwave to cover food that gets dirty and disgusting.  They seal so easily and they don‚Äôt leak either‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had the ‚Äúother‚Äù containers with snap lids on the sides that are a bit of a pain to close, ones with buttons in the middle that never really seal that well and are a pain to clean.  These are just so easy to use and actually work! I highly recommend them and came on here to buy more actually because these are the containers I have been looking for. The one downside is if you like to reheat things in the oven these obviously wouldn‚Äôt work because they are plastic but they have solved my container needs."
"I had a set of glass containers but they kept chipping, they were heavy, and I always worried they'd break.  These are the perfect size for my needs. I haven't used the big one yet, but will of I bring a dish to pass. The next ones down I use daily as a perfect container for one meal. The next smaller are great for left overs. The tiniest ones I use to store sauces on the side so my meals don't get soggy.  My only disappointment is that if you eat from this container it is easily scratched. I had some chicken and didn't want to dirty a separate plate. Lesson learned.  The tops fit extremely tightly and then snap close as well. I can't imagine them ever leaking. And I use them in the microwave with the vented tops.  So, if you want great set of containers for storage, these are perfect. I'd recommend eating from a plate to avoid scratches.  I paid $36 but see now that they cost much, much more. Not sure I'd be pleased if I had paid more than $40. However, at my price point they are great!"
"I‚Äôve been using these for almost a year for my husband lunches and they are awesome! Nothing stains or leaves behind a bad smell (even fish), they are durable, the seals are great and the clasp are still super tight after all this time. I just served 2 of these 10 pc sets so I could have the large and small sizes as well.  Dump the $1 store crap and buy these, they hold up, are leak proof and heat up without even removing the lid, just pop open the clasps and there are vent holes below them."
"I don't understand why it is so hard for companies to make containers that make sense the way these do. Very few offer sets that don't include round units. Round is not an efficient shape for my fridge or pantry. Rubbermaid does it with this line. Yea! These containers come in glass and plastic. The reason I chose them is that they only have three lid sizes for all the containers which saves storage chaos, they are not round, the lids clip on securely I use the glass units in the fridge and the plastic for pantry, and they are microwave, freezer, and dishwashersafe. So nice. The one thing I would like is for someone to bring these to my house and do all the pantry organization, lol. I love them."
"These containers are fantastic. I love how clear they are and they definitely seem well-made. The delivery packaging was undamaged, but the product packaging appeared to have been attacked by a bear or possibly a shark. Items were missing and heavily scratched. Replacement exchange request through Amazon was super easy, but not sure how or why they would have packaged the item like this to begin with. Definitely not the driver's fault. The outer delivery box was pristine. Product recommended without a doubt and I've ordered several sets from this collection. Check for bears at the warehouse. Staff could be in danger."
"I was tired of the cheap semi-reusable Ziploc style containers that stain easy, get tossed, and feel greasy no matter how much you clean them. These turned out to be the perfect step up!  The price for number and quality of containers can't be beat. They're made of a hard plastic and seem to be really stain resistant. The seals are amazing. When you here the latches click you can be confident they won't leak. I was also pleasantly surprised how much I can fit into the larger ones. The smaller containers work great for left over food prep, toppings, or sauces. I wish the package I chose had one less small container for just the next size up.  They stack well and shaped to fit in the various books and crannies of your fridge or shelves. Storing the lids can be tricky since the lid locking mechanism prevents them from stacking, but I have a container for lids so I didn't mind. I would note that ""Big Container"" has determined marketing number pieces vs containers is the way to go. This seems like a dark marketing practice to make you feel like you're going to get more and then need to order more. Just make sure you pay attention to this. I you order 14 pieces you'll likely get 7 containers and 7 lids. It's pretty clear but based on comments of people complaining I thought I'd point that out. Rubbermaid if you need marketing advice give me a shout :P  If I had any"
"These things are AMAZING. My husband is wondering why I didn't buy these a long time ago. Totally airtight, watertight, and only two side locking not the 4 sides lock that often won't lock if not on perfectly... None of that positioning calculus here! I use the little ones for sauce or milk to go with his packed lunch for work, the small ones for sides or dessert or the part of his meal that doesn't need to go on the microwave, and the second largest for meals. The big one for storing leftovers if there's enough to warrant the size.  It's flawless and I'm about to buy more right now that's why I remembered to write this review. We LOVE these where have they been all my life?!  And stay crystal clear and clean when when I send him to work with LASAGNA and wash nearly in the dishwasher no special care necessary. Winning!"
"I have been using these for about 3 years and let me tell you, after a month with these beauties I pitched my other containers and replaced them ALL with these. Not once have I regretted that.  You actually get an airtight seal and it really helps keep foods fresh, even keeps guac from browning. After 3 years I have not had a single problem with these containers and they all still look brand new. If you put effort into your cooking and baking do yourself a favor and put your hard work in these containers, you will not be disappointed."
"I bought these containers after watching a review of ‚ÄúThe Best Food Storage Containers‚Äù on a cooking show, and I‚Äôm glad I did. A while back, I purchased a similar style storage system with glass containers and thought they were great; however they only lasted a few years, then started to crack, chip, and even break in half in the dishwasher. At first, I was reluctant to go back to plastic due to the common staining and warping issues, but I‚Äôm glad I did.  First off, the Tritan plastic in these containers seems to be far superior to standard plastic food storage containers. It is harder, clearer, and studier. I‚Äôve been using these a few months and have seen no scratching or staining, even with storing chili and soup. My favorite part is the lids. They are tight fitting and make a solid seal on the container. When you pop the clasps and pull to remove the lid, you hear a vacuum-seal type noise. Before ever storing food, I filled several of the containers with water, put the lids on, and shook them like crazy. There was no leaking whatsoever. I actually prefer these containers to glass as they are lighter, and I don't think they are prone to cracking and chipping.  I can think of no negatives regarding these containers. If you are looking for an alternative to the flimsy plastic containers that only last a short time and don‚Äôt want to deal with breaking and chipping glass, these are for you. I highly recommend these for your food storage needs."
"I had genuine concerns about the quantity of space I would need to store this set, concerns were completely unfounded! Actually amazed at how little space it took the containers in their lids! Because of the diet that my husband and I have been always eat salads every single day. I could never make the salads the night before because other containers the mixture of the vegetables everything would get soggy, nothing would be crisp. Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth with these! I actually could make a salad including cut up cucumbers lettuce radishes three different kinds of greens, and tomatoes and a full five days later the salad was still every bit as good as the morning I made them. These are worth their weight in gold. And being beautifully clear I can see exactly what‚Äôs in my refrigerator. I wash them in the top rack of the dishwasher. I see no clouding of the plastic from etching. I have since thrown out every other food storage container I owned. I have so much more space in my cabinets. I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased!"
"I love love love these containers. Hubby had bought a set about a year ago that we just started using. Well, I fell in love. So I recently purchased another set. The seal is incredible, no leaking, airtight, and food items are kept fresh for days on end. Love the crystal clear view and sturdiness as well. I stored a piece of left over cucumber in one of these babies and it kept fresh for over a week, just like fresh picked. Did the same with a piece of avocado which did not turn brown at all. My son took BBQ chicken with sauce for lunch to school and later excitedly bragged how the container did not leak (which we feared) and food looked fresh. Now he's wanting to take home cooked meals to school more often. I plan on purchasing more sets to replace all the other mismatched, ineffective containers in my cupboards."
"Like most people you acquire many different types of storage containers, you may like or dislike certain features of each container.  But then comes Brilliance by Rubbermaid and it changes the storage container conundrum. I cannot think of one thing that Rubbermaid hasn‚Äôt thought of. The containers are easy to use with a closure that is easy to use and is airtight. You can freeze anything you make in them and reheat in them in a microwave. The only thing you cannot do with Brilliance is put them in the oven! Clean up Brilliance on the top rack of your dishwasher and they are stain resistant. Have used them to store Stuffed Cabbage, dropped them in the freezer and after reheating in the microwave Brilliance was totally stain free. My plastic containers are all stained from tomato based foods but Brilliance did not stain.  I have now purchased additional Brilliance containers in a multitude of sizes to replace my ugly stained and wrecked containers. I am extremely pleased with the Brilliance product and they are made in the USA. Rubbermaid has knocked this one out of the park with Brilliance product line and Rubbermaid is making a difference as Brilliance is made in the USA and employs our fellow citizens."
"Quite happy with the Brilliance products, and we're slowly buying more, although if I were to do it over again I would purchase glass versions. The biggest issue is that they do tend to hold onto a scent for a few washes or uses; for example, when using them to store some fresh flash pickles, they smelled like pickles for weeks. Was hoping they would avoid this issue as it was part of the reason we moved away from the traditional Rubbermaid.  The more expensive glass versions still can have the issue with scents too due to the plastic tops and clamps, but definitely not as bad.  Haven't tried microwaving them, but they certainly work fine in the dishwasher and have shown no cloudiness yet."
"Covid has driven me to organize my closets and pantry. I started off with a plastic set of BRILLIANCE food storage bc I had used a different version for leftovers years before. The more I sorted thru the pantry the more I ordered. I‚Äôm guessing I ordered some form of this item on four occasions.  These are awesome at air-proofing my dry goods and do not leak when used for ‚Äúwet‚Äù leftovers. (Seriously, I flipped and shook leftover soup over my sink with zero leaks!w  My advice would be to figure out how many and what size to order BEFORE ordering. If price is an issue there are many similar items available at a lower price. Read the reviews. Watch for sales. I have no regrets tho."
While I absolutely cannot say enough about these food storage containers and I absolutely love them I only have one complaint and a very small one. So first the containers are very durable the tops fit very well and stack very neatly. I absolutely love the sizes they're perfect for what we need and I will definitely be buying another set. Now my only complaint is that one of the containers came with a very small crack in the bottom. The craft did not go all the way through it look like the Box had just been dropped and it was a very like crap. I haven't made too much of it because I will simply use this container to store dry goods and as I mentioned it doesn't go all the way through the container. I have not bothered to contact customer service about this issue because it's not a big enough issue for me to worry about at this point. I bought these containers after seeing them at a friend's house and having them recommended to me and they are as good as I was told.
"Doing great so far, but it has been less than a month. I am not sure they are going to hold up after use in the freezer. I hear a lot of crackling..... seems like they are very stressed. They are definitely air tight....nearly hurt my fingers trying to open after being in the freezer. Not recommended if you have arthritis....can be difficult to open. I notice the ratings for stars are not connected to durability, rather air tight or leakage. It's been a few weeks, but will update my review at a later date. These are being heavily used, so will be a good judge to see how they hold up ""over time. I have to make my dog's food, so rotating weekly. Large batches stored approx 3 weeks."
"LOVE these containers. For storage, they nest well together, lids stack ok but wonky due to the fabulous seal and locking lid, worth it! I will be purchasing more of the 2.5 cup size: perfect for lunches at work. The lids lock and they are truly airtight and leakproof. I throw soup in my bag on its side daily. All of my coworkers now own these, I only wish I would have provided an affiliate link! You'll be clearing your tupperware bin of the old stuff and restocking with these. They have not stained for me. I reheat everything in them in the microwave~just pop up the locking wings for steam to escape. Dishwasher safe after a rinse, perfect!"
"We had used the pop-top Tupperware to cook in the microwave, but they kept cracking or got unsightly. These are a great replacement!  They can go from the fridge into the microwave! To vent, you just place the top on without locking down the sides. It‚Äôs perfect!  The only downside I found was in the portion size. You gave micro, small, large and extra large. I wish there was a medium‚Ä¶but we use all sizes."
"I have always used Rubbermaid and over time they always needs to be replaced. I actually cook in these at time and even after cooking in the microwave, they look like new! Like the set so much I bout two of the addition 4 packs in the 4.7 cup size.  A little warning, if you pack them with hot food and put them in the fridge, leave one of the vents open! Close it the next day after it have cooled down. Being airtight the vacuum could harm the containers.  Some of the damage I saw in the other reviews looked like the user failed to do this.  If you want the best, look no farther."
"I really love these. Plan on buying more. I have noticed that my fruit has lasted much longer in these containers. The fact that they are clear helps when looking for something to eat in the fridge. If your on the fence, buy them. I‚Äôm tossing all my old plastic and replacing little by little with these. My only complaint is the really small containers are pretty useless. Good for taking dressing for lunch but other than that, I‚Äôd rather have less of those and one bigger size."
"Rubbermaid containers made out of this hardplastic material are the best. They hold up forever, not like the other ones made out of the ""soft"" plastik. I bought a set of these years ago, the ones with the ""normal"" lids, and they're still in great shape, well... the few pieces I have left. Because, if you take someone food in on of these containers, i guarantee you won't get the container back. People tend to keep these, because they are so nice. Yes, a few I had to throw out, because my mother(82) can ""fry"" food in the microwave, (Know what I mean ;) cooks too long and too hot in there) and that is just not good for any plastic container. No too big of a fan of these clamp down lids, they are just a bit more difficult to clean , but oh well, not a perfect world, is it?! All in all definetely would buy again!!"
"I can't believe it took me so long to get some storage containers like this. I've been struggling with those round ones with the blue lids for a few years and I think I only have 1 of them left.  We don't have a lot of cupboard space in my kitchen so I am always looking at ways to better organize it. It's a big bonus that these can all stack nicely within the largest container in my cupboard. I find that the mix of sizes are perfect for me. The smaller ones are great for any kids leftovers and the larger one is great for a bigger meal thats being prepped, or a large amount of leftovers.  These seem like they have a great seal and they've been super easy to clean as well. I am sure these are fine to put in the dishwasher but I always worry they are going to get a little warped, so I wash these by hand. I am super happy with these so far."
"I can't say enough about these storage bowls! I sent leftover home with my dad in one and he asked me to buy him a set, so when I did they were on sale and I got me another set! These are seriously used daily in our home! I also meal prep so these go to work with me daily also!! Never leaked!  Also my dad is a truck driver and takes his lunch in one everyday!"
"So simce Covid has closed most restaurants near work, Santa bought these Rubbermaid containers for Christmas. Today‚Äôs plan: Meatloaf and spagetti for lunches and scrambled eggs for breakfast. They come in a variety of sizes and so far I really like them, because they stack in the cabinet and the freezer. I prefer the 1.3 cup size because it holds a serving of soup, meat or veggies quite nicely. The smaller size .5 cup is perfect to take dressing or other condiments. They don‚Äôt spill if turned sideways. The larger sizes are perfect to store leftovers or for salads for lunches. Trying not to waste food during a pandemic, and also like the fact that they only take up two shelves because they stack and smaller sizes can go in larger sizes. Microwave for 30 seconds at a time to avoid overheating."
"I love these. They‚Äôre great for prepping lunches, or just throwing things into the fridge. They are truly locking and leak proof. Cleaning around the grommet can be annoying sometimes, but it‚Äôs minor. I wound up buying more to completely replace all of the storage container in my house, and have enough variety for lunches."
"I needed new storage containers because for some reason we did not have all the lids to match the old ones anymore. I bought this set to start us off and I brag about them all the time. I love them a little more than I should! They are sturdy, they click closed and don't leak, I love that I can see what is inside of them clearly, and you can microwave with the lid on and not get food spatter inside the microwave. If you are in need of food storage I highly recommend them."
"Normally I opt glass or metal over plastic but in my kid's school they do not allow glass lunch box and I could not find easy to use metal one. So I had to buy a plastic. Considering it is BPA free, I preferred this brand. Easy to use, and totally leak free. I am really positively surprised. Now I use this boxes when I go anywhere to keep snacks for whole family, lighter than glass so more convenient to use it."
"I love my brilliance containers! I now have 3 full sets of these 5 containers because after having just one set for quite a few years and loving them I just had to take advantage of the decent price and bought two more. They suction closed really well and have such a tight seal that they are actually just a little tough to open sometimes but that's okay because I know they are sealed well. I use them in the freezer and love how they stack either in the fridge, freezer, or just for storage. I also love that I can see what's in them so easily. I put them in the dishwasher and nothing seems to stain them, not even spaghetti sauce. I got rid of a lot of my other containers to make room for these."
"I travel for work, I like to use something that last longer than the normal cheap plastic containers that just end up getting thrown away after awhile. This set really fits the bill here.  These look like glass upon appearance. However they are much lighter. Which I really like. They seem very durable. What I really love about this set is the lids. They seal so well, and are so easy to use! You can tell Rubbermaid took a lot of time engineering these to be great. They are about a thousand times better than the throw away container lids. These are so secure. I really like soup, the middle size of this set is perfect for soup, I don't have to worry about it spilling out of these even one little bit! They seal airtight, and very securely.  I couldn't be more pleased with this set."
"I go through Tupperware rather quickly. I used to buy glass storage containers before, but the lids were the weak point. They do not last. Plus there is always the risk of dropping one and seeing it shattered. Not good if you have children walking barefoot around the house.  We started buying these. They are holding up well. The lids are superb. They create a fantastic seal which allows the food to remain warmer for longer. The don't absorb any colors or smells. We will see how they hold up overtime."
"I bought these because we were at a friends house for dinner and she packed up the left overs for us in these and GAVE THEM AWAY. I'm still so shocked over this. It felt like Christmas. I loved the two she sent leftovers in so much I immediately texted her asking where she got them. She sent the link and I love them so much I threw away all other food storage containers. They are the perfect size for everything and I use them for lunch, meal prep, and just general living. I do not give mine away though!!!"
"PROS: I don't like the pricing, but the value for a proper seal makes it somewhat fair. Be sure and measure out the sizes, some of these containers are really tiny. These are the best food storage containers I've used in my 40+ years of cooking - and I've tried them all. You can hear the air rush out of the larger pieces when you seal and hear the air rush back when opened. CONS: High priced for me. I'm not sure how tough they are if dropped. They feel sturdy but breakable. People with long fingernails might have problems opening the locks."
"Love these containers. We had so many different plastic containers it was driving me nuts with all the different lids and trying to match them up . Plus I hated when most of the ones we had got stained and Smokey looking. I decided to replace them . I found this item at another brand name store. I bought one to try it out. Loved it. Then I looked on Amazon for them and they had them in sets so I ordered a variety of 5 sets. They are as clear as glass and the cover suction is great. I washed all of them in the dishwasher , they came out clear like glass. Covers have air vents when you lift up the tabs so no need to take off the covers to place in microwave. I know some may think they are pricey compared to others but they are sure worth the little extra money."
I bought these for my parents. My Mom packs a lunch for my Dad daily and he is a truck driver. His food needs to be in a sturdy container as his work & lunch bags get jumbled and tossed around while traveling from his personal vehicle to his work tractor daily. The containers look sleek and function great! The lids really lock in place and have proven to be completely leak proof so far. I like that the containers themselves are clear and make finding his food easily in his bags. He's had them for a few months and they continue to be durable and they clean up easily after use. These were a great purchase and I'm planning on gradually replacing some of my own flimsier plastic Rubbermaid containers for these.
"These are nice for storing leftovers in the fridge. However, you can use them for all kinds of storage. They have a tight seal and they are fine in the microwave. I bought too many sizes. What I use most frequently are 9.6, 7.8, 4.7 and 3.2 cup sizes. They all nest except the 7.8 cup sizes. Can't figure out why, but I intend to report this to Rubbermaid. I found a solution though. The nesting is important because I keep mine in a large drawer."
"I liked these so much i bought a set for my sister. They seem to have a good seal. The black handle looking parts on the side that flip up cover air holes, which locks the top on. They can be a little tough to open sometimes, but I don't mind this. It actually makes me more confident that the top will stay in place when I want it to. The lids kind of take up a bit of the room on the inside of the tubs so you can't fill them up completely and just throw a lid on. You have to leave a little room for the lid. This is only really affects the small sized tubs, as they have very little room to begin with.  The big container is a really good size for big leftover meals. The medium size gets used all the time for apples or rice or whatever. The small size is pretty small. I sometimes use it for raspberries, maybe nuts. Honestly, the small size is sooo small they are kinda meh. I haven't found much to put into them. I use them more as little tiny bowls and don't think I've actually used them for storage. I would gladly trade the two smaller ones for another medium tub.  These are the first tupperware type containers I've owned so I can't really compare them to others. But I am happy with my purchase."
"When I first recieved these I was impressed with the quality. Even though it's plastic and not glass, the plastic is very solid and cleans easily. I immediately ordered another set. Here's why.  The seal on these is fantastic. If you like to cook food in advance and then store it these containers are great as they force all the air out and then seal and you get an air tight seal. Food stays fresh in these and there isn't any leaking. You will look forward to eating what you stored inside. And they clean up quickly and easily. They are solid and look like they will last for some time.  I have been using these for about a month now and have been impressed with them. I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality food storage."
"These are great containers. I‚Äôm giving them 5 stars because they are sturdy, easy to clean, they keep food fresh and are definitely microwave and dishwasher safe. My only quip is stack ability and size. The first set I ordered came with these teeny tiny little things that hold maybe 1/2 cup or less of whatever. I know for myself they are pretty much useless. Others may get great use out of them and if so good for them. The second set I ordered was better as it was less expensive and had only the bigger containers which was exactly what I needed. They are also not so good for stacking and storing. Even if we do put everything in the largest container and stack them from there whenever you need one you have to pretty much empty it all out and find the corresponding container and lid. So I‚Äôm still giving them 5 stars as these issues I‚Äôve explained are small ones and may not apply to everyone."
"I've been needing to replace my Tupperware so when I saw this set I decided to try it. It is very sturdy material and I like it better than the more flexible, thinner Rubbermaid Tupperware. It cleans very easy. I was impressed that it is truly leak proof. The size of the containers in this set is perfect! It's a little more expensive than some of the other Rubbermaid but it is well worth it as it is more durable and will very likely last much longer. I will definitely be purchasing more of these in different sizes. I want to get the larger ones for dry food storage next. I definitely recommend purchasing these."
"These surprised me. I avoid plastic for many reasons, but I gave these a shot because they were on sale and the reviews were strong. I bought a 2nd set at regular price because I like them so much.  The top clicks closed securely. I've never had leaks despite bringing soups and salsa and the like with me for lunch. They work very well in the freezer. The little vents that are hidden under the locks were a pleasant surprise. It makes microwaving that much easier.  I wish they had a set that was ""specific"" for meal prep.. Like a set of ten that only had 5 medium and 5 smalls. I don't use and haven't used the big shoebox size container."
"Don‚Äôt tell my moma but I‚Äôm putting all her 5000 pieces of hand me down Tupperware in the storage unit. I know she has a lot of money in it but she bought so much over so many years that none of it matches. Plus it‚Äôs bulky. It‚Äôs so nice to have the Rubbermaid pieces that are compact, leakproof, and they all match! It‚Äôs beyond wonderful to look in my cabinet and fridge and see all these uniform matching pieces and nothing sticks out like a sore thumb. Honey just call me Martha Stewart!!!"
"Love these. Easy to store in the fridge and in the cabinet. Love that they are clear, but our favorite parts are the steam vents. They go straight from the fridge to the microwave with just a flip of the top clips. We don't have to mess with splatters or microwave covers. We have had them about a month. The only problem we hit was spaghetti sauce. Microwaving that in the same container two nights in a row resulted in stains on the lid. They are permanent. We have decided this will be the only container we use for spaghetti sauce. It's still worth keeping them as everything else (even soup with tomato) has done well. Also, love the lid locks as we have not spilled ANYTHING and the fridge is odor free. In fact, we liked them enough we ordered another set with different sizes."
"I hesitated on spending the money on these because I just assumed they were ""the average Rubbermaid containers"" I was wrong, in a big way, since purchasing I have thrown out the old ones with the red lids and purchased another set of these. I have purchased the red lid set several years in a row because they were lower in price and I realized I should have just purchased these and saved money in the long run. I put a quart of almond milk and drove over an hour with no leakage. These containers are very easy to clean by hand or in a dishwasher, with no greasy residue. So far they are keeping those stale smells away, and I use them to transport salads with onions and they do not reek of that old onion smell. So far these are keepers I highly recommend."
"Purchased them first for myself and now for my daughter and daughter in law and best friend as gifts. I swear, I cut a head of lettuce and placed it in the large one and it lasted over a month fresh as the day I bought it. Same with a banana (doing experiment) and it worked, lasted a week longer. I chop up a whole onion in the beginning of the week to use while making dinners during the week, and they‚Äôre all fresh from day one. I couldn‚Äôt do that with any other container. And doesn‚Äôt smell up the fridge either. I love love love these."
"Received 5 containers with 5 snap/stay closed lids that have built in seals for no leakage. They arrived in the Rubbermaid box. They are non-bending containers and lids (hard, solid, semi-thick plastic). If you drop the containers they might crack like glass (not shatter), but maybe not. We haven‚Äôt used them yet. See photos."
The best sealed tight stackable containers. We live in RV. space is vital. These help Refrig and cabinets. Organize stackable and freshness from the great deal. Could use some different sizes Perfect and made in the USA. CANT GO WRONG  Ps don‚Äôt try to lift from seals. Lift off by corners
"Finally purchased a matching set of re-usable storage containers. Grew increasingly frustrated searching through a zillion cheap plastic containers with cracked, ill-fitting or non-existent lids that leaked. These Rubbermaid containers are ideal. Many different size, matching leak-proof locking lids, transparent, sturdy, stackable, safe for freezing, microwaving, and the dishwasher! This set is well worth the price. Thank you Rubbermaid. I don‚Äôt need anger management class any longer. Hahaha!,"
"They are made of a hard plastic. The seal is very strong and there's an audible hiss of air when you close the lid. There are two tiny holes on the lids under the clasps if you wish to microwave food and I suspect to have an easier release of the vacuum. I don't intend to use it for fluids only dry goods and dairy products. My fridge has no cheese /deli drawer and this is perfect to seal in the freshness. I've included photographs of the packaging it comes in, the seal, the holes in the lid and it's current use in my fridge."
"I purchased the pantry organizers and loved them so much that I decided to get these storage pieces. Knowing what to expect, I bough two orders. I was not disappointed when they arrived. I knew that they would keep my food fresh from my previous experience with the product. I see a world where I use this product for many to organize my entire kitchen from the pantry to the refrigerator."
"I am slowly replacing all of my storage food containers with these. They are such a game changer! They stack up in my refrigerator neatly without taking up any more space than they have to. They definitely keep food fresh or longer. I noticed cucumbers I had stored in the large container for a couple of weeks literally tasted like they just came out of the garden! If we do have a tumble in the refrigerator, there‚Äôs no leaks. They wash well, and they are durable as I‚Äôve dropped a couple with no consequences. Everybody in my family has now been turned onto these, they are great investment and once you buy your first set you will not want to use anything else."
"I love these containers! I wanted them for a long time but couldn't justify buying them when I had containers. Then finally I broke down and ordered them anyway. I am so happy I did! I love being able to see inside easily and not have to open a container to identify what's inside. The lids fit tightly but are really easy to put on--just sit them on top and push down in the middle, no fighting with the last corner to go down. Reheating is wonderful, too, because all you have to do is pop the latches and pop in the microwave. You don't have to mess with getting the lid to balance just so, and taking stuff out with the lid still on means no more hot moisture drips on your hands. They are also perfect sizes for everything. If I had more room in the cabinet, I'd have another set!"
Is the best ever! I have recommended these to my friends and family. I use it for everything leftovers and packing our cooler. The seals remain watertight in the ice in the cooler. No more soggy sandwiches or cheese . It‚Äôs great to rewarm stuff in the microwave. It doesn‚Äôt mark or stain. One thing is to consider if you are storing onions and leave them in there for a long time the gasket will smell. I like them because they are rectangular and my fridge is not round. Stacks nicely for storage.
I love that the items are glass with a thick seal on the top of the plastic lid that is removable so they can go into the dishwasher. I clean the seal by hand to help preserve it. Also one of the best for small storage since they all fit into each other. One set is square and the other set is rectangular so wonderful also for the friderator. Made life so much easier than all the plastic containers of varying sizes and lid shapes falling all over. No more falls from the cabinet coming at me as I try to find the right one!
Right up until we used these containers. Now I have a new favorite type! I thought the fastening feature of the lids was going to be wonky and get in the way but I was wrong on both accounts. These containers stack and store well and they work wonderfully. I love how they almost vacuum seal the contents! We're already talking about getting a second set and I'll recommend this type to all my family and friends. Thanks!!
"To be clear, I have no issue with Wise Company and their products. This is specifically related to the seller and what they're shipping (see photo) in place of what is being sold. I ordered the Wise Company Long Term Emergency Food Supply, Breakfast and Entree Variety, Twelve-120 Serving Buckets. However, what I received was Twelve- ReadyWise Emergency Food Supply 124-serving variety buckets (incl. entree, beverage, and desserts). This sounds like a good deal on its face. Except, the received buckets only contain 64 entree servings, weigh 27% less by volume, and are worth only about half of what was paid. (For 12 buckets, this is almost $1,000 difference.) Amazon sellers are shipping substitute items which by the serving count look right but are fundamentally different in quantities and calorie content. Buyers don't notice the discrepancy and the seller gets to pocket the difference. I refused the delivery at the truck and was refunded immediately. I went directly to Readywise and repurchased from them."
"We thought we were getting all breakfast and entree‚Äôs, but instead we got breakfast, entrees, pudding, juice and milk. We paid an awful lot for non food products so instead of all meals we got a variety of items. Be careful, somehow things are being substituted without our knowledge. What little food we have tried has a great flavor, we mainly got this for its long term storage."
"You know you can live for a whole year on $50 worth of rice and beans, right?"
"It‚Äôs on me that I did not read the reviews before ordering. Half of the ‚Äúservings‚Äù are orange juice and pudding. Agree with other reviews that I have no issues with Wise, but the reseller."
"What they advertise is not what you get. What you get is valued on Amazon at a one bucket price of $110.00 with free shipping. 110 x12 = $1,320.00. What I paid for but did not receive cost $1,914.90 for 12 buckets. That is a $594.90 steal that Sailing East cons you to pay for by promising one item then sending you something else of far less value. The cheaper item they substitute with is 12 buckets of ReadyWise 124 serving Preparedness packs. All 12 of them if you get 12, I first got only 10 are exactly the same not the 6 of one, 6 of another variety they advertise. You lose a lot of the total per bucket weight in food and also get a lot of powder drink filler inside, instead of food. No Lasagna, Ala King, Chili, or Granola. The serving size in the new product is horrible. What totaled as 72 servings before is 80 servings now. The claim that a serving package feeds four could only be true if feeding 4 small grade school children. You get scammed on the calorie content too."
"I will be covered on my food basics for several months if anything crazy happens, this is good piece of mind for me.... on this one basic need. Still have others things to prepare with"
Very happy
Long term food storage for energency use.
"I did not like the limits placed on the number of products I could buy at one time. However, I plan to purchase some more product next month if it is available."
"This is not a knock on wise. It is a knock on how the product is shown and written up. I wish I had not bought this. I just went by Costco and saw this available there. I could have bought 33 buckets for the price I paid for 12 buckets here.  I think that the adds for this confuse most people. This says 1440 servings. Unless you count desert and drinks as food, there is no way this could feed 2 people for 1 year or a family of 4 for 6 months. If you limit yourself to 2 meals a day, this could last a year for one person. In Xylella's review of this product she shows the label that is on top of the bucket. Review that lebel and you will see that a large portion of servings are of the desert and drink variety. They should label it in such a way that you can see how many servings of entrees, breakfast, desert, and drinks.  Saying this order 1440 servings is misleading. They should have said this ""768 servings of food 384 servings of pudding, yogurt, and fruit (bonus pudding and fruit added to the number) 528 servings of beverages."" Saying that would give the buyer a better idea about what was they are buying. In my case I would not have bought it at this price."
"There isn't much I don't buy from Amazon. I do however, check around first. Concerning this product from Amazon...There is better for less if you do a little research."
"I've bought a bunch of brand name food containers in the past & basically they're all junk. Brands like Ziploc and Rubbermaid don't seal well and break after a brief amount of usage. The multitude of different colors and types of containers I've collected have create clutter and disorganization in my kitchen. I decided to take the initiative and replace all of my junky food containers and replace them with a professional set. Enter the Fifame brand food storage container set. What I like about this set: -BPA free -Every container in the set uses the same size lid (no more mix & match) -Excellent design to minimize space, units are stackable to keep kitchen organized and save space -Leakproof, lockable seal with heavy duty silicone rubber seal -Easy to clean and thick & sturdy construction  I recommend this set and plan to purchase another one to further organize my pantry."
"Pros - Great price for the quality and amount of containers received. - Seem durable and made out of thick plastic. - Lids seem to have a very strong seal (I haven't tested liquids or if they're leak proof) and everything I've stored thus far (several weeks now) tastes as fresh as the day I opened the package. - Lid size is universal; all the lids fit on all the various sizes (only height changes, the top opening width remains the same on all the pieces). - Very helpful in organizing dry goods (I haven't tried anything wet). - Kids had tons of fun helping me clean up the pantry and said filling each container was ""very satisfying.""  Cons - Contents of new cereal boxes may or may not fit depending on volume. I mistakenly went by weight volume and thought cereal would easily fit in one large container but it typically doesn't and I have to use two, but it depends on the cereal size and shape. For instance, an 18 oz. box of Life cereal fits perfectly in one large container, however a 14.7 oz of Apple Jacks does not--I have to use one large container and one of the smallest containers to fit it all (see pic).  - Unwrapping these bad boys ain't no joke! I am not elderly nor have any dexterity or hand-control issues and when I read reviews about how hard they are to unwrap, I assumed those people had arthritis or something. Nope--the containers come wrapped in thin plastic sheets and then are stacked inside each other so they create a vacuum seal that is hard to release. After several frustrating minutes and contemplating my immense, mortal weakness, I finally figured out a trick (see picture): 1. Sitting on the floor, place the stacked containers gently between your knees, with the open side facing the floor. 2. On the most-bottom container closest to the floor, very gently squeeze the plastic just above the opening (not the lip, since that is hard, rigid plastic). (This breaks the vacuum seal between the plastic wrap and containers.) 3. Lift up on the containers up and pull them apart."
"These are well made , easy to use, open and close . I liked my first set so much that I thanking to order a another one. I bought several food containers from different vendors at Amazon. This product, so far, has been the best in durability and versatility department. I use these cannisters for dry storage, it's not meant for liquids. The cannister part is washable can find what I need right away. This product is at the top of my list for storage containers."
"I've got a housefull - 2 kids (growing boys), 1 husband and a mother-in-law so you can imagine how chaotic that can be trying to keep everything stored in its place. I had been looking at getting a set of these forever but they were just so expensive. A friend of mine set me onto this set and honestly I won't look back.  The pros - everything now has a place, the stickers are wipe clean and don't peel off in the wash (I don't have a dishwasher so I can't tell you if they stay on in that) they store in the fridge and in the cupboards and most of all they save my sanity!!  The Cons - there really aren't a whole lot of cons. I would have liked to have gotten more of the larger size ones instead of the three snack size ones, the lids can be a little iffy to get on but just like with a good pair of shoes once you work at them a bit they go on just fine.  Really recommend getting these for anyone that needs to be organized!"
"Disrgard the peeps here who can't read a description or just generally do not understand how products like these work. No they are not crystal clear. They are clear plastic and exactly what I expected for the price. They come stacked together and may take a little effort to pull apart but it is not impossible and certainly not worth all the whining some other reviewers have done.  If you need good, air-tight containers at a great price this is a great option."
"Out of the box, they look good and they feel durable. They seem air tight. Everything was there (containers, lids, scoops, labels and marker).  For the price, there are only a few other options close to the piece count so I'm hopeful these will last and we can order a second set for our RV/Camper dry goods.  Seller reached out to me to fix an issue we had quickly, highly recommend."
I have other organizational products but these are my favorite by far. The lids are all interchangeable so I don‚Äôt have to search and they are airtight so my food stays fresh! I use them in my cupboards and fridge. Easy to clean and comes with a bunch of different labels and a pen for them!
"I decided to organize my pantry as whenever I see my mom's I get envious lol. Took a day to do so and used these. The sizes are great, nice and airtight, and I love the little labels! Note that I only labeled the containers that I am going to keep the same food in over and over, otherwise you can see through the sides just fine to see what is in there. Overall very pleased!"
These containers are easy to open and close and you can see the food without opening them.. my pantry looks organized and the airtight storage means it keeps the food fresher. I love them. It's a great value.
"Absolutely love these. I love that all the lids fit all the sizes, that the silicone gasket comes out for easy and thorough cleaning. These have made my pantry and my cabinets so much more organized. Definitely recommend!"
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this product. Air tight! I put water in it to test and no leaks. Many different sizes. All kids are the same size. The only thing I‚Äôve noticed is sometimes I have to switch one lid for another because it won‚Äôt close and stay closed. No a big problem because the kid seems to fit on another one.
Every spring there's a bug problem at my apartment complex. I'm putting all my pantry items in them to keep them safe from bugs. There perfect for this. They came in good condition and are very well made.
The pen is kind of light for the labels and I wish there were more bigger ones but honestly this is a good deal and these are really nice containers!
"These worked great for REALLY organizing our pantry. I thought the set was too big when I started unpacking it, but now that I've filled them all I may buy another to get the remaining items in the pantry."
"These food containers are just what I was looking for to organize my kitchen cabinets. I am using them for sugar, flour, cornmeal, oats, rice, pasta, etc‚Ä¶they work perfectly for my needs."
These made my small pantry much more organized and it's easier to find things now! You may need to order another larger set for flour and sugar though if you routinely keep these items
My cabinets are so organized now and have so much extra space!! I love these. I don‚Äôt know what took me so long to order these!! Life changing
"These containers are just as described. It's important to loosen the tops before using, just move the flaps back and forth a few times. They have made some much needed space in our pantry."
"My pantry is finally organized!!! This product is amazing worth every penny I have a very small pantry and now everything fits. What I loved the most is every lid fits all the containers ü•∞ Very affordable, durable and the labels were a plus!"
"Love this airtight containers. It helps to satisfy my Kitchen cabinets organizing OCD. Well made, stacks nicely, saves space and makes panty looks nice by reducing the clutter."
Nice fresh holders. I like the way they stack. They are heavy when u fill them. Caps seal real tight. These are great. I love them.
Nice for s mm all Pantry's . Various sizes did work out.. only wasn't aware of snap on lids but still like and will use.
I had to get these for our pantry because of a mice problem we were having. It has been a life saver and helped us organize. I also love that is comes with stickers so you can label them if you want to.
"Great variety of sizes, perfect that the lids are all same size."
"I would definitely recommend these containers, they are absolutely perfect for what I needed them for!!!!"
I am using these to store a lot of rice and flour they are great. Very thick and air tight
"Sizes are great, lids fit well and love that lids fit all containers!"
"I have had these for a few weeks now and my cookies have not gone stale! This looks great in my kitchen and keeps my cabinets in order (just the way I like it!) the lids were difficult to get on at first, but after that they work great."
"I have only had for about a month. So far, so good."
"Locks, stacks & cleans easily. As with most plastics spray w/cooking spray before storing red food products i.e. sauces, etc.. Beware, non returnable item."
Love these!!! Airtight keeps food fresh no matter what is stored in them. Highly recommended.
"I was skeptical to buy these because of some of the reviews but they are perfect for what I was needing, good quality, and even better pricing. Very happy with this purchase!!!"
"Came as advertised. As others have said, they are not as clear as the pictures look. The only down side for me is that they are not as stackable as I thought they would be. The lids are flat on top."
"Lleg√≥ justo a tiempo, son muy c√≥modos para almacenar"
Helped my organization 10 fold.
I think they are good so far. I‚Äôve only had them for about a month. They do every thing I want them to. The lids were kinda tricky. But I watched a video from the company on that and no problems
This product does ok for the most part. Would like to have more smaller and bigger ones.
"I looked at a lot of different storage sets and ultimately went with this one because it contained more larger containers than other sets. So glad I did. They are clear, air tight, and they come with cute scoops and labels. I would definitely recommend."
"Fabulous organization for pantry, very easy to use. There are so many different sizes that fit all needs. Labels should be a bit larger but overall a great product for organization. They are airtight and easily stackable."
My daughter had purchased these and told me how great they were so I bought a set. I absolutely love the variety of sizes and how durable they are. I wanted to reorganize my cabinets and they worked GREAT. I highly recommend!
These are great for your money. Only $52 for a variety of different sizes. I was looking at getting oxo containers but these are way more affordable and come with a lot in total! I also enjoy that they are airtight so my food will stay fresh. I love them!
Great storage containers. Items stay fresh!
This set of food storage containers are absolutely what my pantry was needing.
I love all the lids are the same size except for the large containers. And u can see what's in each one! Also you can erase the label and rewrite on it!
Finally able to organize my pantry. Containers are easy to use and easy to clean.
"They are functional, good quality, I just would have liked them bigger"
Quality of item was first-class! Remarkably quick delivery. Select packaging. A+!
My kids always break my storage containers so far it has survived the past month normally it wouldn‚Äôt.
Just what I needed to get my pantry in order
Was in love at first sight and happy ever since. Bought a set for a housewarming gift because I love mine.
So I make jello gummies! Different flavors and now I will be selling them for a craft show I will be doing this Christmas. I wanted bags that weren't too small and not too big. These were the perfect size for me to make samples. They gold three oz of my gummies. I haven't tried to seal them yet. I heard to use a flat iron. That's the next step. I tried a lighter didn't work.
We've bought this 3xs and only 1 was defective. They are entirely smell proof. They open and seal perfectly several times. We have tested this out repeatedly without fail. My only complaint is that I wish it came in white or other colors
"Hanser ""Premium Products"" lol junk junk junk. The bags are defective and won't open. When and if I do get them to open the resealable portion falls off the one side of the bags it self rendering them on unable to reseal. See photos"
Fanfuckingtastic. Deff ordering some.bigger bags to fit half ounce and ounces asap. My customers love the presentation.
- Odour does not escape - 7 grams of chunky bud or loose leaf fits easily.  *** The name on the back of the package is a poor choice and I cover it with the prescription label.
Pretty good. Not the size I was looking for a bit on the smaller side but I found use for them and they seem to work well.
Top Notch! Quality bags. I get alot of use out of them. I can reuse it. Love the matte look. And I don't mind the Hanser name on the bag because I can just cover it with a label. All around kick ass product! Will buy again! Thank you Hanser !!!!
Very useful I use it at my cbd store
Gets the job done! Amazing product!
"I add a little sticker to these bags and it greatly increases bag appeal, especially after you vac seal the top. Only complaint is the little Hanser logo, but I cover it up with the stickers."
I bought 3 sizes and each are perfect and look professional.
Sooooooo I‚Äôve been buying Mylar smell proof bags from amazing for almost a year now and I‚Äôve tried many types and a lot of them are different in many way this one tops all of them for the simple fact that they have different sizes they also have see through windows in the front I‚Äôm definitely sticking to these bags
I bought these to put my bath products in that I create for my own home business and they are wonderful! Perfect for my products! Very sturdy and makes my product look cute! My customers love them! Will be buying again!
"Great product, and fast delivery. I will purchase from this family-owned business again, and again."
I‚Äôm not sure if you guys noticed or not but I‚Äôm extremely happy to ship with you guys . I‚Äôve reordered the same item over 5 times and look forward to ordering more. Please and thank you for continuing to blessed the world with your product..üôèüôè
Just what I ordered and everything that‚Äôs described. And for a good price can‚Äôt beat it.
"Perfect for what we use them for, glad you decided to make your marking smaller but still wish it wasnt there at all. Doesnt affect functionality and other than that they present well."
I ordered the wrong size . But that was my fault . They are exactly as they should be . And came in no time . Thanks
Nice packaging - Bit more expensive than other sellers but the material is worth it. Exactly what I expected
Dimensions are spot on. These are remarkable effective and durable.
"Love these bags and for price & quantity, I am now only using these from now on!!!!........."
I really like these bags perfect size for my treats. Love the quality of them and the color.
Good
The baggies look even better in person. They feel professional and it makes presentation great.
Best product I bought in long time that actually works just as it‚Äôs advertised. I will definitely be buying more this month and months to come.!
"Arrived on time as advertised. Smell proof when sealed with a heat sealer. Not sealed, you need to put your nose to the zipper to smell the contents."
"I love these bags, they are very smell proof which is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for and hold a very good amount."
I love the quality and the design. It's not thin like the other brands I've bought before and it definitely keeps the smell inside.
Nice
I would love to buy smaller versions of this same bag . About 3 inches wide 4 inches Tall type of Bag . I would definitely buy them
Very good designed bags and get here within 2 days every time ! I will keep shopping
Great quality. Will be ordering again soon.
Perfect!!
"Order these recently and love them overall. Only the slightly smallest detail change would be to have the option between a clear or opaque back. The hemp flowers we place our bags in, you can see the buds through, but not 100%. It's not a problem but would have preferred a clear back so you can fully see the content inside. Other than that very small detail, everything else is GREAT! Hope to see more products soon."
they are sturdy but a little small. i will be looking for bigger ones. but great bag
Overall great product holds together well no defects
The size/space inside the bag & the bags are smell proof for putting spices in when I take them to work!
Definitely the real deal..
Good quality and bigger than expected
Super clean and good quality bags definitely will buy again
Awesome product!
Great item
Very good product keeps smell in bag good design also
They work.
Good product Good price
Great
Good quality
I am very pleased with the quality of product in the HANSER | Smell Proof Odorless Mylar Resealable Foil Pouch Bags. I especially like the clear Window and the fact that it is airtight for food. I am a distributor for a Global weight-loss Coffee and Cocoa product. This is the perfect choice to make up samples of product to distribute. I don't have to worry about the product losing its value and know that it will keep fresh. Thank you for providing this great product to help me with my success. I highly recommend.
"I have purchased multiple times, the product can be very sturdy and durable. First few times quality was great, was very happy. Unfortunately last few times not so much, on one batch you couldnt open most of them without ruining/tearing seal (manufacturing/production issue) on the last one ordered they sent the wrong size.  Overall I gave them still 3 stars because the quality of the product is great, but the company's quality control is not evidently. Hoping they can fix these issues, I really want to continue to purchase and do business long term."
"These are JUNK! Arrived today and started to open to pack merchandise, out of 11 opened only 2 opened properly! The glue on one side comes off the packaging! DO NOT BUY!!!!!! Will be returning ASAP! They are overpriced for the lousy construction of the bags. I figured I‚Äôd pay a little more with this brand. Buyer beware!"
"Cool bags but the window isn‚Äôt super clear like some other bags I‚Äôve had , snugly fitted 3.5 grams of herbs and I‚Äôm not biggest fan of the material used . They get the job done tho"
"The bags are a great size for an 8th of material but can squeeze more if necessary. definitely lock in the smell. if not completely, almost fully. will keep fresh but obviously theres nothing like a mason jar for longer periods of time. at $0.17 a bag its a great deal. would purchase again"
Great product only thing I would change would be offering a larger size. This has nothing to do with this product just some hopefulness from a happy customer.
The bags themselves are nicely made and seem to work well. I haven‚Äôt tested the smell proof part but I will and plan to update my review.  The reason they have three stars is because they include their logo on the back and I want blank bags. The logo is huge! I‚Äôll use these and then look for blank bags. I‚Äôve never seen product bags with the bag company‚Äôs logo on them.
"The bags were great... When they could open and close. The ziplock seal would often come loose from the bag, making the seal useless. I was only able to used about half of these bags because upon opening the bag to put product in it, it would pull the seal from the bag entirely."
"As a small business owner myself, I look for the best products to package my old fashioned rock candy. Well look no further! 10/10 would AND WILL buy these again whenever I need more packaging.  The 4√ó6 bags hold my 4oz perfectly."
Comes faster than expected and best quality for the price
"Very durable, available in different sizes and absolutely the most air proof, odor sealing pouches I have ever bought. So sealing they are a bit tricky to open at first for some. I‚Äôll never use any other type!"
Impeccable value for the cost. The matte black finish has an incredible feel to it that will certainly add value to my product!  Love the packing solutions provided to my start up business by Hanser. I will be purchasing more shortly to continue expanding.  -J.Lambert Founder: E.C.O. Systems
These bags are a great value for the quality and quantity. They open up and can stand up and they work great. I've used them with a heat sealer and they worked great. No problems with them and they do the job. You can reseal them to keep your content fresh. One side has a clear window so you can view whatever is inside. Great quality I will continue to purchase
I have ordered this product several times will work the money will buy some more in the future.
Nice product will buy again when needed. I appreciate the easy size exchange. Thank you
"I was looking to find some good zip lock bags in this size with a window and when I came across these bags I thought I would give them a try. I am completely satisfied with these bags and they are exactly what I was looking for. I love that they‚Äôre matte black too. If you‚Äôre looking for a sleek and subtle ziplock bag, these are the ones. I absolutely recommend these Hanser bags."
"Really like these bags. They are well made and look great for the most part, just wish the Hanser branding was much smaller or not there at all. I'll buy these again if I can't find something without branding. In the meantime stickers will cover the branding on these."
"These bags are amazing! The quality is great, and I love the window so you actually see what's inside. I would definitely recommend these bags to everyone who wants to store something that smells since you can't smell anything once it's fully closed. I'll keep buying from this seller because I'm fully satisfied !"
get your work on like a professional.. never had a issue with these bags and they delivered fast.. thank you guys for a great product and i highly recommend
Be careful opening the bags the seal just rips apart makes it virtually useless can‚Äôt reseal after it‚Äôs open what‚Äôs the point...  I‚Äôve bought 300 of these bags and this is the only bad batch..
Odor leakage matches performance of a Ziploc bag. False advertising by Amazon.
Too small waste of money

Perfect for bag organization in an oversized drawer
I love this!!! Product is strong. I went for the one piece storage knowing I was going to mount it in the pantry (I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the open and close top closure one) and it‚Äôs is a space saver for sure. I was able to fit a whole box of each in the appropriate slot. I love it so much I‚Äôm going to be getting the storage one for tin foil and such to make even more room on the pantry shelves
"No more squished, torn baggie boxes! This is a very clever organizer and doesn't take up any more space than the separate boxes themselves. It's quite lightweight, but feels plenty sturdy for it's purpose. It takes a little effort when loading a full box of baggies into the appropriate slot, but once they are in it's a breeze to pull them out as you need them. Not something I went looking for, but I'm very glad to have found it."
Fits perfectly in my kitchen drawer. Easy to fill and keeps my plastic storage bags neatly organized. Makes grabbing the right size ziplock so easy with its nice labeling.
"I love this item so much! Our baggie drawer was so disorganized! Now it is so nice and neat! Every size baggie fits perfectly in it's assigned spot! I love showing it off to my friends! Very sturdy, easy to clean and make sure you measure before you buy!"
"If you like your drawers organized, this product is for you! So cute and sturdy. You feel kinda fancy when you open your drawer lol"
I like that it is heavy duty. Hung it on the inside of my pantry door with command strips. Works great and frees up a drawer in the kitchen.
Just wondering why I haven‚Äôt ordered this before! I absolutely recommend this to everyone!
This is the best thing ever.
"this is so cute, very functional"
So easy!!! Just take your storage bags out of the boxes and insert into pre labeled slots!!! Your drawer now has so much more space.
My wife loves it
Didn‚Äôt realize I needed this product until I got it on a whim and loved how it organized a drawer I came accustomed to being cluttered
Esthetically pleasing
"Love the way it cleans up the drawer, keeps everything tidy and organized."
Great product.
"The written words on it were not colored in sufficiently to give it a good quality appearance‚Äîsee photo. Although the box looked sturdy enough, the overlay bamboo top is rather flimsy. One piece cracked when I took out the bags to replace them with a different kind, and I had to re-glue it with wood glue. That said, the design is good and I purchased two more of these from a different manufacturer for Christmas gifts."
Unfortunately the quarts size slot is the exact same size as the snack and sandwich in length meaning I had to shove fewer bags with a fold into the chips
I loved what the product is made out of bamboo if I remember correctly but other than the gallon size working well the others just not so much. I had some quart size with slider closing that didn‚Äôt fit. The snack pack size fit well. Love the idea just didn‚Äôt work for me.
"Concept is great however was very disappointed that it was not sand down to a smooth finish, it was very rough and I had to sand it down in order to use it. As well as the quart size slot being too small to properly fit bags"
If you hang it on the wall everything falls out as the wholes are to open. I put cardboard in the slots to hold the bags in but still able to pull them out.
I love how neat an organized this looks but it arrived damaged. I thought it was a fluke but then the replacement arrived with similar cracks.
The space for the quart bags is too short so they bend and don‚Äôt fit many at all.
The only thing I did not like about this product was that the opening for the quart size plastic bags was the same size as the one for the sandwich size bags and the quart size bags did not fit into the item. Had to return it for that issue.
I have ordered 4 of these because I loved the idea of organizing the drawer. Each one was either cracked upon arrival or cracked soon after.
"Unfortunately, a piece of the wood was broken off on one side and is cracked on the other. More trouble to return it so just going to glue the wood piece back into it."
See photo. Would you like that hanging on your wall?
It's a good way to keep bags organized
"The item came out of the box damaged, with a piece of the bamboo front having chipped off during shipping. I glued it back on no problem. A week later, a large piece between two slots flew off when retrieving a bag. It's just flimsy bamboo that is poorly made.  Great concept, just don't buy this one."
Came cracked
This was cracked plus had no openings to put the boxes thru
The storage box is true to size all bags do fit inside but all around the openings and edges are rough and not sanded. The outside of the box is smooth with some sort of coating that makes it smooth and shiny with no splint wood. It does fit in my drawer and serves the purpose to have everything organized. But it's wide for a normal drawer to fit I do suggest checking the measurements before. But it also can be hung in the wall.
"This is one of those products where it's hard to determine if you really need it or not. I received this and wish I had it much sooner! This has done wonders for my drawer that I store all ziplocs in. I love that everything stays in one unit and I don't have to deal with all of the different size boxes. It is easy to load in the bags - the only issue I had was that the quart size bags don't fit as well as the other, they are too wide for the slot. I was using the ziploc brand zip top bags. I might try a different bran next to see if it fits better."
I was so excited to get this! I love organization and this box really cleaned up my drawer. Very sturdy and well built!
"I honestly thought it was silly to purchase this as the boxes worked just fine, so I thought! This helps keeps all the bags together and fits perfectly in our drawer. No gaps between small boxes or wedging the larger box in. It looks great, is sturdy and is easy to fill. Great purchase."
"Matches my cabinets perfect. Sturdy, durable, and etched labeling won‚Äôt wear off, so for the price and delivery, glad I picked this one!!! Can‚Äôt wait to stock up on the other sizes now!!!"
"The boxes the baggies come in always got squished, so while I was organizing my baggie drawer, I decided to order this. Looks great, love how each slot is labeled. Looks so much neater than the crushed boxes!"
"I never write reviews but this product is worth it! The bags fit well in the slots, and works well in my drawers. It's so nice to have the bags you need available and neatly organized. Would highly recommend :)"
This fits perfectly in my pantry and perfectly in the drawer
"These boxes are really beautiful and very stylish. I have them on display on my worktop. They have soft close lids, which are really easy to open and shut. They wash and dry well and are of excellent quality. You can see what is stored inside at a glance. I am so pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend them."
very stylish and nice üëå
"Die Marke Mepal ist einfach unschlagbar! Anfangs habe ich es eigentlich nur der Farbe wegen gekauft. Mittlerweile habe ich nur noch diese Beh√§lter zu Hause. Auslaufsicher und die Gr√∂√üen passen einfach perfekt. Die kleinste Dose sieht eher Mini aus, sollte man allerdings nicht untersch√§tzen! W√ºrde ich definitiv weiterempfehlen."
"Kam schnell an. Das Set ist super verarbeitet und sieht echt schick aus. L√§sst sich ganz leicht √∂ffnen, hatte erst einmal Bedenken, dass wirklich nichts ausl√§uft, da es mir optisch nicht so sicher erschien. Dem ist aber nicht so. Habe auch schon alles in die Sp√ºhlmaschine getan, bin sehr happy."
"Sehr ideal f√ºr luftdichten und auslaufsicheren Aufbewahrung von Resten nach einem Men√º. Super ist das gro√üe Sichtfenster! Damit braucht man die Dose nicht √∂ffnen um nachzuschauen, was drin ist."
"Wir haben schon mehrere dieser Dosen zuhause und sind nach wie vor von der Qualit√§t und dem Design √ºberzeugt. Im Set hat ein Deckel gefehlt, der Verk√§ufer tr√§gt hieran keine Schuld. Es war alles originalverpackt-da ist wohl beim Hersteller was schief gelaufen. Kann mal vorkommen. Der Verk√§ufer hat sofort freundlich und hilfsbereit L√∂sungsvorschl√§ge unterbreitet. Insgesamt also ein top Produkt und ein freundlicher Verk√§ufer. Gerne wieder!"
Produkte von MEPAL sehen sehr gut aus. Produkt entspricht den Erwartungen.
"Very resistant, easy to store as it takes little space and easy to wash and it doesn‚Äôt keep odors"
Top Qualit√§t
La qualit√© est au rendez-vous. Pratique et solide je recommande.
"Enfin des boites de conservation √† la foi pratiques, esth√©tiques et solides ! Je d√©sesp√©rais de trouver des boites pour remplacer celles que j'avais achet√©es chez Ik.. et qui ont franchement mal vieilli... Je suis ravie de cet achat, les boites sont id√©ales √† mon go√ªt, en plus des qualit√©s d√©crites ci-dessus elles s'empilent toutes et prennent donc peu de place dans le placard, c'est parfait !"
Obwohl die Versandverpackung den Transport unbesch√§digt √ºberstanden hat ist die Produktverpackung an verschiedenen Stellen besch√§digt! Wurde uns hier evtl. ein nicht neues Produkt geliefert?  Die Sch√ºsseln sind jedoch okay.
Ordentlich verschlie√übar und gute Gr√∂√üen. H√§lt was es verspricht und ist ideal f√ºr unterwegs. Ich nehme sie nur noch. üëç
Bin komplett auf Mepal umgestiegen. Finde es allemal besser als T....e.
"Nachdem ich nun meine K√ºchenschr√§nke ausgemistet habe, musste endlich etwas schickes her. Optisch sehen die schwarzen Boxen richtig klasse aus, Ich nutze Sie daheim und auch f√ºr unterwegs, von au√üen sind die Beh√§lter unverw√ºstlich. Ich habe die schon oft mit ins B√ºro genommen und von au√üen sind die Sch√ºsseln nach wie vor sch√∂n. Aber man muss sehr bei den Deckeln aufpassen, ein Mal den falschen Schwamm genutzt und schon sind die Deckel zerkratzt und vermackelt. Auch ohne Schwamm kriegen die Deckel bei jeder kleinsten Ber√ºhrung gleich kleine Kratzer, das ist total schade.  Auslaufsicher sind Sie auf jeden Fall, ich hatte schon Saucen und Aufl√§ufe in den Beh√§ltern und da ist nie nur ein Tropfen ausgelaufen, die Deckel sitzen wirklich bombenfest."
"Die Boxen sehen super aus, bis man darin einmal Curry auch nur kurz gelagert hat. Selbst bei den billigsten Vorg√§ngern war das nie ein Problem, nun sehen schon 2 nicht mehr wirklich gut aus‚Ä¶ wenn man dann noch den doch recht hohen Preis bedenkt ist das eigentlich ein No-Go!"
Did not check for leakproof yet just used a couple but love the sizes they came in and love the colored tops i think they are a great value ... oven and freezer and dishwasher safe which is all great! Tops are dishwasher safe which is one thing i was looking for. Just need a couple of larger ones now for storage of soups and stews
"I love this set. The variety of sizes are perfect for leftovers and meal prep. I prefer the glass to use in the microwave. I love that they're see through for ease of locating items in the fridge, plus they stack nicely and make the fridge look nice and organized. I have not experienced any leaking when I use them in my lunch bag. I've had them at least 6 months and use frequently, they seem to be holding up great in the dishwasher (lids on top rack)."
"I‚Äôm in the process of getting rid of my plastic containers, I bought these to see if I liked how they were made. Yes! They are durable, microwaveable, and dishwasher safe. I like their sizes, but it‚Äôll be nice to get ones a little bit bigger for other things.  I go to these more than I do with my plastic ones."
"Great glass food storage containers, that can go into the oven, microwave, and dishwasher too! The lids can‚Äôt go into the oven or microwave, but are tightly sealed when closed on the glass containers and keep food very fresh. These were exactly what I‚Äôd been wanting and needing. Multiple sizes are excellent and make it easy to stack them too."
These food storages are great. Love the sizes and colors. The silicone part of the lid comes out super easy and cleans well. I will definitely get a second set.
"Lids and containers are very solid, lids snap on very securely and no leaks! Nice assortment of sizes and I can feel better about less plastic contact with mine and my kids‚Äô food. Lids are holding up well after dishwasher, too. Would definitely buy again."
"These glass containers are great. They arrived in good condition, all individually wrapped. I have washed them twice including the lids which I place in the top rack of my dishwasher and they come out perfectly fine, and no warping."
"I bought these after a friend left a similar style container at my house.  They work great and are much more durable and easier to clean compared to the plastic containers we use to have. I was very happy with this purchase.  A couple of the lids were difficult to snap into place at first, but after a few uses it seems to have corrected itself."
I love using these at work. I started hating how icky my old plastics ones got so I switched to these 2 months ago and they‚Äôve been amazing! No weird residue after cleaning.
"If you love glass containers and the convenience of plastic tops that lock and are leak proof, these are for you. I personally love glass over all that plastic. Do this is Fabulous for me"
Well packed for shipping. Like the different color lids for the different sizes...takes the quess work Out of matching lids to containers.
"I've now gotten rid of all plastic storage products and use only these glass containers. I love them because they can go in the oven, on the table and in the fridge. They're pretty easy to clean. They were a great value, especially since so many containers came in the set!"
"I posted yesterday that I received the wrong tops for 2 of these bowls. 20 Pieces Glass Food Storage Container with Lids. Well I did receive them I just put them in a different place, so I want to take back my 1st post. These are wonderful containers. I will definitively [purchase more of these."
"They are great, can see what‚Äôs inside and they close ever so tightly keeping odors and freshness in. Love them."
These containers are easy to clean and keeps items fresh.
"I struggle with closing the lid on the yellow container, but so far no chips or breaks. I wash everything in the dishwasher and I left one with yogurt and fruit on its side in my backpack one day and didn‚Äôt have a terrible mess of my hand. If I had more storage space I would buy another set!"
These are wonderful and durable! Ordering another set!
"storage glass is more effective than plastic, etc. We love them and the varied sizes fit the needs our small refrigerator."
Sturdy and cute. These glass containers are best for leftovers
These are good quality and good sizes. Definitely worth the money
"I haven't tried to drop them yet, so I don't know about how durable they are, but they are fun with their colorful lids and they are easy to store."
Love these containers. Worth the money.
Get rid of all the old discolored plastic and get. This is all you need.
"Very impressed by the quality of the glass. Heats up food very evenly and also portions great. I‚Äôm not on a Whole30 diet or any other diet besides my own and it portions very well. I wish the lids had a moisture control mechanism but other than that, it‚Äôs a great product for a great price."
"This is my second set of these containers. I had the first set for several years, but over time they did chip, mainly because they were banging against each in the dishwasher or I was rough washing them by hand."
Just received; looks good; like the color coded tops; just had to get away from plastic containers which shed junk into the food.
"These bowls are well designed and seem to be of very high quality. They open and close nice and the lids seems to hold a tight seal. We will see over time if the lids hold up, but as of now they are really nice, especially for the price!"
"I love the different colors, keeps food nice and fresh from the durable seal"
"These glass food containers stack up in my fridge nicely, make lunch prep easy and they transport nicely. Glass is microwavable and easy to clean. I've dropped it a couple of time and so far, no breakage. The lids seal on nicely and keep the food fresh and keep my food from getting other fridge odors in."
"As√≠ como se ve son, se sienten de super buena calidad, encanta con ellos"
Like how these don't stain when heating up some food. Easy to clean.
Great quality of glass containers. Perfect sizes. Doesn‚Äôt get too hot in microwave.
Perfectly perfect
Takes up less space.
They are really good. Leak proof even when turned upside down. Store well in small spaces.
Air tight seal works exactly as should. Lids sometimes have water marks after cleaning
"Oh, these are awesome! A lifetime of crappy rubber storage containers has me over the moon and wondering why I didn't switch to glass sooner. Cute, easy to clean with just a bit more effort to get all the nooks of the lid, but not as bad as many other kinds of lids. My husband looked at me like I'd lost my mind when I literally did a little dance of excitement when I unpacked them.  Labeling it ""20 pieces"" is deceptive though. It's 10 storage containers. Counting the lids as pieces seems a bit shady.  Oh, and t a x the r i c h."
"Very pleased with this purchase. It's great that they can be used all the way from freezer to oven. No more worries about scratched up discolored plastic containers. Rectangular shape is nice as it allows better stacking and fit in our narrow side by side refrigerator. Lids fit very well. Haven't tested leak proof, but they have 4 over the side locks and a rubber gasket in the lid."
Trying to get away from plastic storage containers and these glass ones work perfectly!
Great product will order. More
"THEY WORK WELL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SO FAR SO GOOD"
Packaging was really good. Containers look clean and not scratched at all. Perfect buy
I do the Beachbody program so these are great for food prep. They are sturdy and easy to clean. Love them.
Great for taking leftovers to work for lunch. Small size for the fridge.
"Great quality - definitely leakproof, durable, dishwasher and microwave safe. Great value for the price!"
"I‚Äôm trying to get rid of the plastic in my life, it‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs a start. Even though the tops are plastic, the bottoms are glass, very easy to clean, dishwasher save and great for stacking in the fridge."
Great product. Only used a week but very pleased so far
"This is the second time that I ordered the same once. They are great. We use them in our condo in Florida with tropical climate, so they have to be airtight and easy opening and closing during use. They passed the test."
"Very well made, quality materials. Shipped very well packaged. Easy to see contents."
"I love these glass containers, I can see the food in them and they are very User friendly. Love them"
"Sturdy, well-made containers. The perfect range of sizes in the set--just what I was looking for. Lower price than name brands with the same quality."
I like not having the pits left by dishwashers that you get with plastic products.
Very high quality while less expensive than the name brands!
"Am replacing all my plastic containers with glass and these MCIRCO Airtight Glass containers are great. Dishwasher (not the lids) and oven-safe, plus I can safely reheat food in the microwave. Great buy!"
Securely locks. Looks great. Easy to clean
Too small
These are great and love that they are square!
"They are oven, microwavable, dishwasher safe & freezeable. Wonderful seal !"
Love them. Helps with left overs and smelly foods.
Excellent quality. Heavy glass and secure lids. Better than plastic.
very nice and secure lids. love that they are dishwasher safe
Well made and the color coding keeps the lids with the containers. Love it.
awesome
Keeps food fresh! Durable for sure. I dropped and nothing happened. Definitely air tight. I'll be purchasing more for sure!
We have tried other brands. This what decided to get. Love how much space they save up stack able. Buying another set. We like them so much.
Works great and the lids seal easily.
"Love this set. Very durable, easy to clean, easy to take lining off tops, and easy to close lids. I use out the lids in the dishwasher and I haven‚Äôt had an issue with closing the lids. Good buy"
Love
Handy easy to clean ....I love them
"These are the best. Well made, perfect sizes."
Excellent for my application. I basically use them to store (bag) my beef jerky. Works for me 100% and great quality.
They arrived caked together and hard as a rock. Absolutely useless.
"Lleg√≥ antes del d√≠a estimado, estoy contenta con el producto"
"I use this brand and 300cc packets and I loved them at first but I‚Äôm learning that they don‚Äôt last very long. I mean if you accidentally leave one out for 20 minutes it heats up and then it‚Äôs useless which the bag does state the 20 minutes deal, but‚Ä¶ So just trying to break down the packets into smaller vacuum bags takes a few minutes even though I work as fast as I can‚Ä¶I lost over 10 packs because it took me 20 minutes to finish. And I keep them in a resealable bag and have everything ready before I even start‚Ä¶. So, I have mixed reviews on product. They work, but they don‚Äôt last if you open a package a couple times and reseal it so you go through a lot of them."
I should have returned these the minute I opened the mailer and picked up the package. Couldn‚Äôt even bend the package. Hard as a rock. But we don‚Äôt have a printer or neighbors for printing return label. Both unable to get out somewhere to a printer for a return sticker. Really a bummer because we needed them and we paid for rock hard oxygen absorbers.
"I checked to make sure individually wrapped and they are not. They came divided in half in two separate shrink wrapped bags. You will either have to use half at a time, or have ready an air tight container to quickly transfer into."
These arrived at my house totally unusable. They were hard as rocks and had to be tossed in the garbage. Learn from my mistake and save your money! They were priced low for a reason!
Easy to use and fast shipping. Got my rice storage bucket fixed and stored in the pantry.
"Great product for my dehydrated food storage. As I sometimes have to re-use odd glass jars I've saved, these come in very handy."
I tried a few on here that said they were 500cc and they turned out to be fake. These are the real thing. I stored some in a sealed air-tight plastic container and they almost imploded it.
They don‚Äôt take up much space and work VERY well. Using to store food for prepping and they work fantastic!
"Order arrived completely opened, and the oxygen absorbers were hard as a rock."
Ended up sending back
Stale product....did not heat up when exposed to air. Don't trust that it works.
I've bought from several sellers & these were top notch! I will buy again for sure!
Received hard as a rock and unusable‚Ä¶
Delivery on time. Effective.
I put these in my dehydrated powders. I absorbed the moister and sealed the lid. Perfect!
Pkg well
Bueno mi experiencia no absorbente bien .
These never got hard just sitting on the counter.
"I use these in storing foods, these work as good as any I've purchased. I'm happy with them."
I divided the bag up for my filament storage to hopefully help with moisture. So far I haven't noticed any ill effects towards my prints however I still tend to toss my filament into a dryer before use. In the future I will probably move towards a reusable bead that can be heated for reuse.
These work like expected. I used them in my Mylar bags for food storage and they do what they are supposed to.
"I purchased the oxygen absorbers for my baking mixes so my dry goods wouldn't ruin. So far, these are working great! The packaging is better than others that I have bought from. The bag has a zip lock feature in order to re-seal the packets that you have not used. The actual packets came in a vacuum sealed bag (see pictures), which is great because I have came into situations in the past with other companies that did not vacuum seal the product. My oxygen absorbers were ruined by the time they arrived to my home. I appreciate this company's packaging!!!"
Product was right on.
They came packed airtight.
Worked perfectly for my needs.
Perfect smaller size for long term storage. Use 2 to 3 for larger packages. These are a smaller size so prefect for using multiples without being bulky.
"Returned. Product was used, had already absorbed moisture. Package was heavy when it arrived."
"These work great, I highly reccomend. I used it to refrigarate my meat and keep it fresher for longer. The flavor says it all. My food stays super fresh and savory"
Make sure all of your buckets are ready to seal before you open these.
"Good size, packets have kept a 40 lb bag of dog food fresh. Keeping all my pets treats super fresh. I put 2 in their carob üç™ container and they are actually soft instead of super hard. My üêïs are loving all their jerky softer & chewy. My üêà treats aren't cement from air exposure. I tried before just having them in containers, but they still got hard, stale quickly. Now even the pill pockets are slightly less dry. I just ü§î there is nothing that can help keep pill pockets from drying out. Next package I'm going to try 2 air packets with them and the jerky. Hopefully they will be even softer and fresher for my pups. I definitely recommend this brand and size if putting into containers. It has worked well for me. I'm even going to use them in my succulent dirt mixture to keep it from drying out. So many uses for these packets. Put them in with the clothing your boxing up for winter/summer (why not) put one in a shoe box. Some clothing and shoes come with these, sure they are not the food grade ones. I feel safer having food grade ones around my stuff in case one of my pets would try and grab one. Definitely recommend this product üëçü§ô"
I've had no problems with these absorbers
I love my containers. They are not crystal clear or sheer but you can see through them. They are airtight. The lids are easy to close. They align perfect. I almost didn't order because some reviews said the lids had issues. I have no issues at all. I can't tell you if they are leak profof because I am not using them with any liquid. I love that it came with labels and can change the label name if necessary. As you can see in the picture I used them to organize my food pantry.
"Great value for the money, great size selection, quality construct, and durable vinyl stickers for labeling with the provided liquid chalk marker. I love that all the lids are THE EXACT SAME SIZE (just the depth of each container varies from small - smedium - med - large). This was my first pantry organizer purchase and made me realize I need more in a bigger size! LOL ; )"
"These containers are just what I needed! Had all these baking items in their original bags across 2 moving boxes‚Ä¶found these containers-at a good price point and purchased some contact paper‚Äî-is this even the same pantry?! So satisfying, our new house is becoming our home"
"This works perfect for pantry storage. Lids are airtight and prevent spills if cannister drops on floor! And lids fit all sizes! Only drawback is they aren't crystal clear, but a tacky looking opaque. Otherwise perfect."
"I bought two sets of these specifically to have a better view of items and manageable organization of our pantry. I have had them for about 5 months now. Keeps crackers, cereals and etc fresh to date. I use black sticker labels and write with white chalk marker of each item in its container. They wash easy, lids are secured and manageable. Love these!"
I was not expecting these to be as great as they are. They look and behave like much more expensive storage containers.
They are really good quality. They keep the food fresher and are not hard to open or close. Sometimes they are a little hard but I have arthritis so it's not the product. And the lids are easy to determine how to place so that makes it easier.
These are a game changer. My cabinet is so organized now! I am ordering more for other cabinets.
"These are of a high quality material, super sturdy, the lids really hold and I love they came with labels and the white marker. My cabinet was in desperate need of organization and these did the job perfectly. I would highly recommend this product."
"When I received these containers, I expected ‚Äúsee threw‚Äù clear plastic containers, the ones I received are milky foggy in color, NO labels came with mine , JUST containers. And I ordered this exact set. I‚Äôm an upset, if I wanted this crap I would have went to the 99 cent store."
I absolutely love these containers. I‚Äôve used both the stickers and chalk marker that comes with it as well as printing my own labels with my cricut. They are great on space and easy to open and close.
These are terrific. I don‚Äôt put them in a dishwasher or microwave so I couldn‚Äôt answer to that. They store my dry goods so very well.
So far so good. Appears to be well made. I am storing flour and sugar so far. I'm hoping these keep moisture and insects out.
Found out I had mice purchased a ton of these they do the job nicely and now no mice are getting into my food thank you
"Not quite big enough for my flour and sugar, but organized my cabinet quite nicely"
"Love these! They have cute little labels and a marker included. No problems, they do exactly what they are meant to do."
These are really nice containers and the price is great for how many you get.
"The kids are nice, containers thick and stack nicely. The labels that come are cute and easily remove to use elsewhere or reposition. The white marker for the labels is nice! Not a dollar store product at all. I love them so much I ordered a second set. My cabinets are all organized and food will last so much longer."
I like these food storage containers easily see what‚Äôs inside and labeling. Great item if you‚Äôre looking to organize your pantry or Cupboards
This is a very good set of containers good tight seals and a reasonable price too
"Product stacked real nice in our cupboards, nice to be able to see through them and the lids were snap on with air tight seals."
Perfect for small spaces absolutely love this product my cupboards are organized
Great quality and seal so well will be ordering more
Love that my son can open and close these. Labels are very nice.
I got these to keep my food stored nicely and for long periods of time. I‚Äôm happy with the ease of being able to seal the lids and take them off without making a mess
"Great product, as describe air tight, great to keep my pantry organized."
"What a great set of containers!! The cost was incredible, the product is quality, & the organization they provided is amazing!! Ordering another set right now!!!"
My cabinet is so organized. Thinking of buying another set for snacks and to finish pantry!
Good product for their purpose. Storing dried goods in pantry.
I am very happy with my recent purchase of these containers. I love the variety of sizes and the quality of the airtigt lids. I will probably purchase an additional set.
Works really well in my pantry to keep things well organized. So far they seem to be very airtight. Well made product and a fair price.
All are great just one is busted. The tall one.
These containers are worth the price. They seem to seal tightly. I like them and look forward to continuing to use them for years.
I love these containers! Perfect for organizing your cabinets and pantry
I love these storage containers. They do the job and look great!
Super muy buenas puede Guardar y Organizar Toda mi Despensa y me encanta que sellan muy bien puedes poner que contienen
Don't hesitate! These are exactly as pictured and described! They have transformed my pantry into an organized magical place! I even purchased another set!
Great for organization and very strong
Used for storage in our RV pantry. It works awesome!
Great product. I love that it comes with the stickers & chalk markers..many sizes too!
I loved storage containers and filled it as soon as I got it. Works great and loved the labels it came with.
"Me encant√≥!!! Cierran s√∫per bien, tienen buen tama√±o y ahora mi despensa luce mucho m√°s ordenada y limpia. Lo recomiendo al 100%"
"I love how arranged it makes my pantry Look. Plus, it is aesthetically pleasing. I highly recommend. It did not arrive damaged...this was important for me."
Best products I have purchased for my kitchen. Fresh food sealed tight. Thank You
"Lids do not stay shut, therefore are not airtight. Package came damaged. Pieces were hard to pull apart also.  Oh and they are Non-Refundable and non-returnable. Save your money."
Love these absolutely perfect
buen material
Like the product but did not receive the stickers or white chalk pen.
Great
Love these containers
"These are good storage containers. I wish they were a little bigger but still okay... not crystal clear plastic but it's still okay... my sister in law saw them when she came visit and she liked them... she asked me for the product link to buy a set for herself:)... when I first opened the box it seemed like all the containers were the same size, but you have to take them all out one by one to discover they are all in there... 6 of each 4 sizes available. Just wanted to clarify that because I saw other reviews saying they got all the same size... which it's not true... they just need to open all up... :) GOD BLESS EVERYONE."
"Product is pretty solid for its price point, very affordable and they helped tidy up my pantry. However the lids aren't very air tight, so I'm concerned about moisture in the long run. The seal isn't as tight a fit as I would like. The container lids also create a lot of dead space between the containers when you line them up, creating wasted space that wasn't there before. I was tempted to return them because of this, but I already ditched the original containers for all my shelf products. So check that they fit in your intended storage space prior to cleaning and filling them up."
"They were difficult to separate when they first arrived as they came one inside the other, but once out, they‚Äôre great. They are all exactly the same size (except for height) so you don‚Äôt have to worry about switching out the lids as they fit all! I have experienced a few not clicking in the full way, but they usually pop in after some finagling. They stack pretty well. The only time it might not is if a lid is slightly bowed (only one of mine is). Otherwise, I definitely recommend for the price of it! üëç"
"Updated to four stars since I received the replacement and I am satisfied with the product. They worked out well for my pantry organization project. Original review: Be cautious. I received 16oz containers instead of the 24 containers in the various sizes listed. Interestingly enough, the outside of the box had a picture of the correct item, but I knew something was off by the box size. I opened these and realized they were all the same and very small. Cannot use. I have ordered a replacement and I will update this review as soon as (or if) the correct item is received."
They are not clear as described. They are very much opaque. AND they claim it has flammable liquids or gases so the Amazon system won‚Äôt let you return them. They clearly do not have flammable gas or liquid - scam. Will have to call Amazon to remedy - but DO NOT BUY.
The description and images show assorted sizes but that is not what I received. I received had 24 of all the small ones. Containers were also not transparent but very opaque and I would have struggled to see what was in each one. Returned item.
The tallest ones are tapered so it causes a lot of wasted space and things don't sit right around them- makes it kinda messy and unstable. Other than that the rest are perfect. Even they're good for cereal.... I just don't get that much cereal.
"All in all a great deal. However I rate these at 4 stars because the lids are very, very tricky to snap shut. At first I thought all the lids were not fitting at all... but the issue is, you have to hold the tupper firmly, while squeezing the lid to snap shut on each side. This goes for every single tupper. I have all snapware and have never struggled to close them, with the exception of this set. I'm really hoping that in time they will get easier to shut after some use. They do work, it's just whether you'll want to deal with this issue."
"Great value, lots of pieces and definitely using them. 2 of the largest ones were broken all the way down the side.  It wasn‚Äôt enough for me to return for a replacement but just kind of sucks because those large ones are what I‚Äôm using most."
"I tried to separate these container from packaging. They were so tightly snug fitting into each other that I cracked some by trying to take them apart. I tried cold water. Warm water. I then tried lightly tapping the edge of container against the toweled countertop edge. Still, pieces cracked. So frustrating. I have yet to fill them, but the airtight seal does not seem very airtight to me when secured. We shall see."
"This is the second time I've ordered these storage boxes. I like 'em. Seem to seal well and stack nicely. To get them apart when they arrive, just sit them in a sink of hot water and slide them apart one at a time."
"These are perfect for 5 lb bags of four and sugar, large container of oatmeal. I also use them for storing a ‚Äústandard‚Äù batch of 3 or 4 dozen cookies. They are airtight but not too difficult to open. If you are storing something heavy, like 5 lbs of flour, you can‚Äôt lift them via the lid ‚Äúwings‚Äù that snap down or you could accidentally unsnap that part of the lid and end up with flour everywhere. But as long as you grab the container and not lift by the lid, they are awesome. The lid does have to be perfectly seated before you snap them shut and it‚Äôs a tight fit to push down the wings so someone with arthritis may find that a bit challenging versus a regular lid but I really like the lock down lid feature. Obviously these are big and they do not nest so when not is use they do take a lot of room to store. They did have an odor when arrived but hand washing and they were fine. The included measuring cups are worthless for actually measuring anything because the markings can‚Äôt be read but work ok for a quick scoop."
"These food containers are exactly what I have been looking for. They are all the same, large size. Most of the containers similar to these come in a variety of sizes, most of them way too small to hold a 5 lb bag of sugar or flour. They are airtight so it keeps any bugs out of whatever I store. We have a mountain home so this container protects whatever is inside. Love the large size! A bonus is that the containers come with a measuring cup inside for each and every container. Before use I ran them through the dishwasher, putting the lids on the top rack. They went through the dishwasher and heated drying cycle perfectly! I highly recommend these containers!"
"So I picked up these to house my growing collection of healthy flours. They‚Äôre air tight and keep the flour nice and clean. They hold a ton of flour, about five pounds of conventional flour. The thing I deducted a star over is the measuring cups. They‚Äôre basically useless except as scoops. It‚Äôs hard to even out the measurements and it‚Äôs really hard to read the cups when they‚Äôre covered in flour.  10/10 for storage and safety of flour 8/10 on the chalkboard labels (there are extras! But it‚Äôs hard to read sort of) 3/10 on measure cup scoops"
"Wow, these container are study and easy to lock down. Came with measuring cups which I will leave in each container. Can see through so I know when to buy supplies again. Fits perfectly in my cabinet. Using to store my all purpose flour, bread flour, wheat flour and sugar. Holds 5 pounds plus of each. Now I know everything will be fresh."
"I love the size of these and the lids snaps on firmly so I‚Äôm not worried about spoilage. They are very sturdy. My only complaint is that when they come two of the four of them are stuck inside each other so strongly that there are nearly impossible to pull apart. I had to order a replacement set and found the same thing happening. I can‚Äôt explain why it happens to two and not to the other two but there it is. After two people tried, I brought over a strong man and he was able to do it. Other than that, fabulous"
"When I am baking, I feel like I am a contestant on a baking show. These bins are just like what I see being used on TV. I painted my kitchen cabinets and knew immediately that I was going to need to containers for my baking goods. I was still using my hand me down containers that were 40+ years old. Props to those containers for lasting as long as they did, but what a fresh new look my kitchen received with these bins! The chalkboard labels are fun to work with and can be easily replaced, if needed. The lids lock on quickly and easily, keeping whatever is inside fresh and ready to use. Get some for your kitchen today!!"
We have issues with ants that seem to like bread and we live in a very dry climate.I bought these to keep the bread fresh (and away from the ants) and not dry out. A loaf and 1/2 fit perfect. Also the big box of ‚Äúgoldfish‚Äù fit in one as the ants also seem to love them!? The containers snap close on all four sides very snuggly.
Impossible to separate. Came stacked together. I will revise my review if the seller has a fast solution.
"I've been on a pantry organizing bender. All my flours, sugars, cereals, chocolate chips, rice, etc. were already in bins and I was left with a few boxes of Saltine and Ritz crackers. I'm moving out of my home after 16 years and going to travel in an RV full-time, so I need to store my pantry items in a way that protects them from humidity since RVs tend to get humid inside. I didn't like the individual sleeve cracker containers and ordered these in the hopes that I could fit a sleeve in them without opening it, but I was willing to have loose crackers if necessary. They fit perfectly. There's about 1/4 an inch between the top of the sleeves holding the crackers and the bottom of the lid.  These will hold up and I expect they'll still be in good shape in a few years when I stop traveling and buy another house. I am very pleased. I didn't need the 4th one for crackers so I dropped an extra bag of bread flour in it. The whole 5 lb bag fit without opening it. Also, one of the canister sets I ordered said it came with measuring cups and didn't. This one said it came with measuring scoops and they were included. Also, the side of the canister has measurements on it, so if you kept flour or sugar in it and wanted a quick way to see if you had enough for a specific recipe, a quick glance would give you the information you need. I would buy these again (although I don't think I""ll need to) and I recommend them."
"Sometimes ordering items such as these online is difficult, even with sizing info available. I was pleasantly surprised, that the size was indeed extra large. For reference, two boxes of the family sized wheat thins fit just fine in one of these. I do feel that they are airtight, although I haven't tested it. The tops fit properly and are easy to get on/off. Pleased with my purchase."
"I own a home bakery and my mudroom is my pantry. I needed something to hold all my mix ins that was air tight and would be easily accessible. For my needs I wouldn‚Äôt use these for flour or sugar as I use 50 pound totes for that, but for a standard family kitchen I could see these being put to great use for flour, sugar coffee etc.  As a professional home baker, I‚Äôve had a hard time finding something that fits my commercial needs that can be stored in a limited space residential based bakery. Gallon zip lock bags are ok but not ideal for stacking and being able to see my product at a glance and don‚Äôt really hold enough. Standard Tupperware is too small for the bulk amount I keep in stock. I‚Äôve tried other storage containers and they were flimsy, too small and never air tight. These are perfect!!! The best size to hold My bulk chocolate chips and other mix ins. Air tight, stackable and keeps my product visible and easily accessible. I will be buying a few sets!!"
"We buy lots of food in bulk and often use either mason jars or Pop top plastic containers, and I like both of those options, but the pop tops are kind of annoying to clean and were expensive, and the mason jars we can't easily scoop out (Flour, sugar, etc). I ordered these because we need more bulk storage and they were cheaper than the pop top ones we buy. I'm happy we did, Stuck them in the dishwasher right when we got them, they turned out fine, Now we use one for flour, one for rice, and one to keep loafs of bread in that we bake, (So our dogs don't eat it!) It is working well for all those purposes, seems sturdy and no issues at all. My husband likes them more than the pop top because they are simple and easy to clean. We've only had them a couple weeks, but they seem sturdy so I'm hoping they last a long time. I wud definitely buy again."
"I needed an airtight container for flour and sugar. After looking at numerous containers in stores and online, I decided the number of high reviews for this product probably made it a safe bet. And the price was really good as well. I was surprised to see they came with a measuring cup for each container. To be honest, I will most likely use them as scoops as the markings on the cups is really hard to read. But I will use them as scoops for sure. The labels are cute and they give you plenty along with a white marker. These hold a 5 pound bag of flour easily. Presently I use them for all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar and pasta. Lids fit securely. They stack nicely. I hand washed them. Overall very pleased with this purchase."
"These containers are exactly what I have been looking for! They are the perfect size for holding five pounds of flour, and they will more than hold a standard bag of sugar. (I had a 10-pound bag; the container held about 8 pounds of it.) The lids are not hard to use, but they are a bit tricky to make fit properly at first--a couple of tries took care of the problem, and I haven't had any issues since. The lids also tend to hold a small amount water after washing, so make sure they are dry in the crevices around rim. The squared shape fits neatly into my pantry and allows me to use the space more efficiently. I like the labels, and the chalk marker worked great--when I made a mistake, a damp paper towel erased it and left a perfectly cleared surface for me to try again. My only extremely minor complaint is that the scoops are really designed for liquid measure, not dry. That hasn't stopped me from using them as scoops, but I don't trust them for measuring flour, sugar, or meal. The quality of the canisters is great, and honestly, the price is phenomenal. For years, literally, I looked for a set of large canisters all the same size, and in these I finally found something both useful and affordable. I really might have to buy another set of these containers for rice and pasta--they could be used for almost anything!"
"Update: my husband managed to place the two lids that were not fitting correctly onto containers and I left them sitting there for about one week or less. I tested the lids to see if I could get them on and off and they worked perfect so I changed my stars from three stars to five stars! The containers came with 2 lids attached and the other 2 were inside the containers. After opening them all up the 2 lids attached lids made a nice popping sound as I pulled them off. I started randomly applying the lids back on the containers. Two went on very easily, but I could not get the other 2 on. My husband finally put all his strength into getting them on and they finally snapped in place. I am hoping the two that would not go on Easily were the two inside the containers and perhaps got warped a little. If they do not stretch out by sitting in place, I will have to return them because two containers will be useless if I can‚Äôt seal the lids easier than that."
"I bought a pack of 4 a year ago and another pack recently. I used them mainly as rice storage. Each box can hold almost 10 lbs of rice, so I only need 6 of them to empty a 50-lbs rice bag.  What I like:  * Simple and easy to clean. * Good size. It's not too tall so it can fit my cabinets very well. It's big enough so I can reach inside easily but not too big to be bulky. The square design means you waste little space when putting multiple boxes together. * They added spacers between the boxes when shipping so it's easy to separate the boxes now (compared to 1 year ago when I struggled to pull them apart). * The measuring cup is very nice. The sharp angle opening makes it easy to pour rice/sugar/liquid into smaller containers. * The labels look nice.  What I don't like:  * If you hold cap edge when lifting the boxes, you could accidentally open the box and spill the contents. I have to reminder myself to hold the bottom of the box when carrying them."
"I purchased these containers for specialty flour. When they arrived they were packaged and sealed together. Upon opening the packaging, I realized one of the covers was broken. I contacted the seller directly via email, and expressed my concern over the broken cover. After hearing from the seller, I was told I could not get a replacement cover, because they are packaged together, but they were willing to refund me $9.00 for my inconvenience. This was appreciated. They also asked for photos, so they could work on improving packaging, so future customers would not have this issue. Overall, I was very happy with the communication from the seller. The containers are great, even with the damaged cover."
"I really like these canisters, and in fact I just placed an additional order. After breaking a glass canister of flour and cutting my finger pretty badly I decided it‚Äôs time to move to unbreakable containers. These containers easily hold a 5 pound bag of flour or sugar. They seal very tightly and stack together very neatly in my cabinet of baking supplies. The labels that come with them are attractive and useful. The scoops are also useful, although it is correct that they cannot easily be used for measurements because it is hard to read the gradations on them . But that‚Äôs OK, that‚Äôs why I have other measuring cups. Also, several reviewers mentioned that the canisters arrived stuck together. My canisters had a plastic bag separating them, which made it very easy to pull them apart."
"In these days when we're all buying 25 pound bags of flour it's sometimes hard to find a good storage container. I went through a big name brand commercial container that was a disaster in every way. These containers are sturdy, BPA free and have great air-tight lids. My 25 pounds of flour split evenly into the 4 of them with about 1"" of room left on top of each one."
"These storage containers work perfectly for keeping rice, flour, dehydrated foods and fruits, bulk organic products and basically everything you could need to put inside for protected storage. As a cook I keep many esoteric ingredients on hand and some in bulk quantities; I don't care to rely on the commercial packaging to retain flavor after opening and so good storage is important. I prefer a straight-walled container to round storage as the make more efficient use of shelf space (I have no qualms about setting them on the floor or stacking then one on the other, either). This was the intermediate size I needed for my purpose though they are definitely large in most people's estimation. The silicone seal makes them odor proof and their translucent/clear material makes it easy to see what's inside and the included pen and labels are a nice touch. I look forward to having them last a long time, judging by the precise molding and close tolerances."
"The containers are stacked inside each other when shipped. The outermost container in my shipment was cracked on the bottom . I am unable to return items so I contacted Vtopmart directly to inform them of this so they would know. I didn't ask for anything from them because it was still usable if I leave flour/sugar in the sack. Their customer support rep, Jessica, offered immediately to refund a portion of the purchase price to rectify the situation. I think this is a good company to work with.  The containers are very tightly closed so I hoped this will be the end of any problems with the flour when a mouse manages to get inside the house."
"I am currently working on getting my house ready to sell in the spring of 2021, and one of my projects was attempting to make the pantry Pinterest worthy. This includes painting the walls, overlaying the wire shelving, installing a cute light, and organizing everything into eye catching containers. I already had some glass containers, and while pretty, they don‚Äôt stack well and can get heavy. I started off with the assortment of smaller plastic storage containers, and loved them. I can double stack them on one shelf, and there is no sag! The larger containers are huge, so there will be no double stacking, but they take care of all my 5lbs. bag storage. Flours, sugar, beans, and even coffee, are air tight and ready for use. Hell, I even started putting chips in these large containers in order to keep them fresh, uncrushed, and a little more challenging for the kids to sneak off with. One of these large containers will fit a family size bag of restaurant style Tostitos!"
"Good: Product is exactly as described. Packaging is excellent and cleaning of jars and lid is easy. Lids have moving parts for airtight fit and I was a bit worried if cleaning them could be an issue. There are clear instructions on how to dismantle lids for cleaning, and it is simple.  Better: Where Kitsure can do better is provide buyer options of different combinations. Currently I have few smaller unused jars and wish had more larger jars  Best: I had a minor problem when on the silicon ring did not arrive. I contacted their customer service via email. Lily from their customer support was prompt, courteous and promptly sent a replacement. In my books you know you have a great supplier when they take prompt actions to fix things. I ordered three more sets and they all arrived with no missing parts or issues."
"Probably 4-5 star here. I purchased 4 sets of these (totaling 16 containers). Just 2cents, take with a bag of salt  Starting with the CONs (as most are probably interested): > NOT perfectly leak-proof. With water test, some containers exhibited very minor leaks (slow drip) past the seal. Not overly bad but notable. Not evidenced on every container, appeared to be semi-consistent on specific corners. Reseating lid seemed to have an effect on outcome  Moving to the PROS: > They definitely resolved a common review complaint regarding the difficulty in separation of the containers by updating their packaging approach (spacing out the containers with an insert). Evidence that they update processes/designs based on feedback, well done! > Certainly holds expected (desired) volume. 5 pounds fine-grain sugar fit in 1 container as reported > Well packaged, unlikely to get damaged in transit (over-box was ~3"" longer than product carton Length, adequate void-fill) > Somewhat sturdy, no real concerns with unintentional damage (plenty sturdy for normal use) > O-ring simple to remove, round-design (not U-shape) making it somewhat easy to clean effectively (may play into seal effectiveness though, but considering it a PRO for cleaning efficiency). > Included stickers & marker for adding labels (qty 16 labels, qty 1 marker) > Included measuring cups (qty 4)  I cleaned by hand, so I haven't tried using a Dishwasher, Freezing, or any other reported capabilities. Made in China  Manufacturer feedback: > Investigate potential O-ring bead weld as a potential cause for leak (regarding CON note of specific corner) > Investigate potential of wall malformation (plastics processing) to determine if wall warping may be a potential culprit for leak (walls certainly warp toward center of container, not overly concerning unless it causes the brim/o-ring position mismatch to affect sealing outcome) > Maybe consider increasing the height of the O-ring seal a smidge to force users to compress more while closing (improving sealing if the above aren't validated) > Potential Increase of the brim thickness, increase the seal surface area (improve seal if the above is not desired)"
"I've been wanting to build up our pantry for years and the pandemic was the push to do it. Not to horde, just to be prepared. We now have 2 sets of these and love them. They are quite heavy duty and durable. Plus they lock down nice and tight. As other reviewers have said, perfect fit for 5lb bags of what ever. We already have 8 of them filled up with food and we'll probably be getting some more. Great way to store stuff and keep it good.  Very happy with purchased these, and highly recommend."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the product. The plastic feels robust and neither thin nor brittle; I won't be surprised if it holds up over time. The nicest surprise was the labels: they're not cheap, thin paper -- they feel like plastic, and there are a *bunch* of them. They're black, and the package included a white paint pen for writing on the labels. What a great surprise! The scoops have measurements in both imperial and metric, and there are four of them if you're the type to keep your scoops in your buckets. This was exactly what I was looking for -- I generally keep four types of flour for baking -- all-purpose, white bread, whole wheat bread, and full grain -- and these hold around 7lb of flour each and stack well, so this was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very happy with the purchase. Also: this company neither offered special extras for good reviews, nor asked for one, so this is an unsolicited review."
"I came home from a 7 week trip to find weevils in my flour. Looking harder, they had gotten into everything. I don't know if I brought them home (we shopped all over while RVing, or if one had decided to have a party while we were gone. It was an instant 'throw out and turn to Amazon."" I found these for my larger items and they are perfect for what I needed them for. I used a lot of Mason jars, too, but those aren't large enough for a lot of items. I then went and bought the set and cereal containers. My pantry now looks like a magazine layout."
"They're airtight storage containers, as described. Saw some other reviews that mentioned they were hard to get apart on arrival and/or had a strong chemical smell. There was a slight smell to these when they arrived, but after hand washing and allowing to air dry in a sunny window it was gone. They were very easy to get apart; they were separated by a layer of plastic and had cardboard spacers inside to prevent them from being forced together too far. Lids fit tight, but take some getting used to to line up correctly. Like them enough that I ordered another set."
"They came with labels and A TON of packaging to make sure they didn't get scratched or anything, which was nice but a bit overwhelming for someone trying to reduce their footprint.  Still, they arrived in great condition. They look nice, keep the food stored well, and would no doubt be easy to clean if I did ever decide to remove my bulk rice and flours.  I will say: for what they are, they're expensive. They do their jobs perfectly and are flawless and came with cute little chalkboard-style labels with white markers to write what they contain and post on your recipe blog, and I still don't think they're worth over $10 a container.  Buy once Cry once I guess, but also six months later I'm still crying a little."
"I needed containers to put my flour, sugar, rice and such in. I want to extend the life of these essentials and to keep bugs out. I wanted containers large enough for at least 5 pound bags. During this pandemic I tend to buy more rice and beans than usual so that I have them on hand in case the grocery stores run out of meat or other food items. These containers work great! Good price and my 5 pound bags fit in them when I emptied the bag. I highly recommend this product. I was tired of searching in my pantry for smaller items and overlooking them because the pantry was unorganized (even though I tried to group item together like all canned soups in one section). I would end up with duplicates of bags of beans or rice because I overlooked them in the unorganized pantry. I also bought smaller containers for my brown sugar and other smaller bagged food. This keeps me from buying more brown sugar when I'm baking because the container is labeled and easy to find. I don't know if they are leakproof because I didn't put any liquid in them but the lids snap on tightly and will keep bugs out and food fresher than storing in bags. I highly recommend this product. In addition, the price is great for 4 large containers."
"Most of my storage containers are glass with hinged lids but I decided to go with these for large volume storage for rice, lentils and grains. These are pretty solid. They're thick walled and tough. The gaskets and the lids sit tightly onto the container and they snap close securely. I'm pretty sure these are airtight. Yesterday I picked a full container of basil and didn't get a chance to turn it into pesto so I stored it for about 24 hours in the container. Usually when I do that the basil turns brown but it was still green the next day so I'd say that yes, they're airtight.  It was great getting labels and there are extras too. The writing pen seemed a little transparent to me but I've never used a white pen before so maybe that's normal over a black surface. I'll be ordering more now that I've checked them out."
These fit perfectly in the spot I wanted them for. They will definitely fit a 5lb bag of any type making flour or sugar. The lids definitely lock tight. First time with locking though you need a little strength. U believe it's only because they are new and once in common usage of unlocking and locking it will get easier in time. Plastic is good and sturdy. Suggestion as far as label marker ; I would buy your own due to the one that comes with the labels is watery. I will definitely buy this again in the future if I need more! Highly recommend ‚ù§
"Have only used to store noodles and potato chips. So i can't speak to it leakproof ability. Has kept chips crisp. Easy to clean. The lids are easy to snap on/off for me. If you have strength/mobility issues, they may not be for you. I had my elderly mother try to open and close and she didn't have strength to close it. I am using 2 for storing non-food goods and they work well for that purpose too."
"I bought these to store our baking flour, which is especially precious during these pandemic days! Just three of these easily holds 20 pounds of flour! The seal is tight - no tiny mealy because bugs will be infesting our flour!!! These are of good sturdy thickness. They stack nicely in our pantry cabinet. I‚Äôm probably going to try more in a smaller size for other pantry dry goods like rice, oats, etc. Amazon had the best price on these too!!! Highly recommend this set! Makes a great mail order gift too!!! Have them shipped directly to someone you love!"
"We picked up 25 lbs of flour at Costco and then panicked as to how to keep it fresh and bug free. Enter these giant cannisters, which are fabulous. They were easy to fill and keep sealed. They stack very stably and the plastic is quite thick. The opening allows for easy flour removal with measuring cups or what have you. The lids lock tightly all the way around with a bright blue silicon(?) gasket that has not shown any wear and tear from multiple unsealings and resealings. The four flap locks click in a satisfying way and it is easy to tell if the lids are properly fitted. My tip for fitting lids, start from a corner and not a side. Saved me a little frustration."
"I got these for the entire purpose of ridding my cupboards of pantry moths. They started getting horrible and nothing I was doing was getting rid of them. Thankfully, these worked absolutely perfectly, and every single moth has disappeared. No more throwing out good food! They're also pretty cute and I like the labels a lot. Just know that once you write on the label, you can't wipe it off - so be sure to only label staple items that you know you're going to get over and over. It's also so much better to have absolutely everything in the cupboards and drawers organized. These gave me peace of mind in multiple ways."
"We recently found out that 4 of my 5 kids are gluten sensitive so that means I need a much larger supply of GF flours onhand. I was struggling with a million bags in my cabinet and praying that I wouldn‚Äôt get a bug infestation. These were the perfect solution. Inexpensive but very good quality. They seal easily, hold in even the finest of flours and had no chemical smell whatsoever. They stack well and have a small lip around the top of the lid to keep the top container from falling too easily. I also love the labels that came with it and the measuring cup. I will likely buy more for the rest of my dry goods."
"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the shipment and took out the containers. They were even bigger than I expected, which as good for me. I was able to empty huge bags of flour, sugar, and pancake mix into them and snap them shut with the 4 airtight enclosures. I was shocked to see that the manufacturer included lots of extras such as 4 measuring scoops, stick-on labels for the containers, and even small brochures about the product. A+. I recommend to everyone. By the way, I also bought the container from the same company that seals a very super-long loaf of bread. Perfect!"
"Numerous people have commented that when they received these storage containers, they were nested and very difficult to separate. They have solved that problem by placing a thin plastic bag over one container before nesting it inside another container. This makes it very easy to separate them. (Just don't nest them when not in use.)  In addition to sealing well, these containers have very good optical clarity, so it's very easy to see what's inside. They seem to be quite durable.  These are 5.2 liter containers according the text molded into the base. This is equal to 5.5 US liquid quarts or 4.7 US dry quarts."
This is the second time I've bought this product because they're FANTASTIC! I just haven't seen anything as affordable and reliable as these containers! It's a gamble sometimes when buying things on Amazon--you don't always get what you think you're getting. This product is a welcomed exception of exactly what they say and as reliable/durable as they say! Well worth my first & second purchase.
"I do a lot of multigrain baking and sourdough artisan breads. These containers are perfect for storing the different flours and helping them to stay fresh. They also help prevent contamination by mealy bugs and other critters that love organic grains. I bought these and some smaller containers from another company which are similar products, and now my pantry is organized and labeled. These cost less than ‚Äúname brand‚Äù containers (I got four for what I would pay for just two) and are much better than the dollar store kind. I would buy again."
"These are just what I was looking for. I wanted large volume, storage-efficient and easy to use. These hit all the sweet spots. The sides are nearly straight, which makes them more efficient for storing in a cupboard. They're big enough that a whole 5 pound bag of flour fits easily. Initially, I wasn't so sure about the latches, but they work very well.  Many people have had a problem getting them apart when they get them. We didn't have any problem with this - they were nested in twos and came apart easily."
"I bake a lot, especially during the holidays. I needed a lot of airtight containers for all my flours and sugars. Purchasing the name brand containers like OXO, etc. are pretty expensive for one. I was a little hesitant to purchase this unknown brand, but I'm happy to say that the product exceeded my expectations. The quality is great and the containers are airtight. For the price, I'm very happy with these containers. I did have one small issue and after contacting the company, they fixed my issue easily. Special thanks to Jessica, who was the representative I chatted with. Overall, would buy again."
"I really like these containers. The four pack is perfect for me, I like the style and the labels, they store securely the flour I've got in there. They can be a bit hard to open/close, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I was disappointed bc I tried to make sure they would hold a 10lbs bag of flour/sugar/etc, the size is listed at 176oz, but that does not equal 11lbs of powder. It holds a 5lb bag well, but was hoping it held more. However, if you're looking to store your 5lb bag of flour, this is an excellent choice."
Perfect for my organizational needs! I like the size of these better than the taller containers because my shelves are fixed. This size is perfect for a family sized box of cereal or the larger bags of flour / sugar. I didn‚Äôt need to label everything because I know what is in most containers. I highly recommend these containers!
Ok so far I'm very pleased with these bins. They took a 25lb bag of rice filling 2 full and one about half way leaving one empty. They did reek when I unboxed them but a trip through the dishwasher on a high temp wash killed that out. If you think about it they've probably been sitting in a semi climate controlled warehouse (if they're lucky) for months on end so a bit of funk is no surprise. They appear durable if my rating doesn't change in a year you'll know they're good. Do yourself a favor DO NOT STACK they will get stuck and require a fair bit of muscle to separate them again. The latches on the lid are stiff but for the air tight seal I would imagine it would need to be fairly tight.
"Bought these to hold bulk stuff like flour, sugar, and rice. The tops lock on nice and tight, so no moisture or bugs will find their way inside! They stack nicely if you need them to. I don't really use the included scoops because I'm usually measuring for baked goods, but I leave one in each container anyway to have a contamination-free scoop when I just need a sprinkle of something. The blackboard stickers are a nice touch, though the writing is a little hard to erase if you're putting something different in the container."
"These are sturdy with a tight seal. Easy to open and close. I don't know why some people said they had trouble getting them apart. They were packaged by the manufacturer with each container in a plastic bag, and each slid easily out of the others. I like these large ones (5.2L) for 5 lbs. of flour because it leaves enough room for measuring and leveling the flour without it going all over the place."
"I ordered these for flour, sugar, and cereal storage. Solid construction. Slightly opaque, but contents are still visible. Came with reusable labels. Lids have four snap latches that, once engaged, seal firmly and will definitely keep the tiniest critters out. You need to make sure the lids are lined up correctly with the container in order for the latches to snap in place. I'm happy with these containers."
"I'm a pretty serious baker that had been fighting off a weevil problem when I decided to buy these large containers to hold my flour. After banishing the darned bugs from my pantry however, they returned to inhabit my banneton only several months later!  At the very least, I'm happy to say all flour within these containers was completely untouched by the weevils. Very pleased to see they are secure against pests.  My only complaint is that the lids are sometimes difficult to put on correctly. I think there may be slight variations in the container dimensions or something (maybe for stacking?). So normally I would -1 star for that, but it's easily +2 stars for protecting my precious flour from the bugs.  Pictured here are the 5.2 L versions."
I was looking for a critter proof container for my pantry and these are perfect. These containers hold a ‚Äúparty size‚Äù bag of chips with room to spare. The added scoops and labels are also great. I‚Äôm planning to buy more as I work through organizing my pantry.
"We had a hurricane about a year ago and since then everyon is having peast problems.I am trying to put everything into containers to save my food and elemant pest problms.These containers are airtight and easy o use,plus very large.I needed something to put all my cakemixes,took thm out of there boxes and tapd the directions to the bag,and laid them flat into 2 of these ndnow the boxes are gone and no worries about peast.I used the other 2 to do with my boxed items(pest lov boxes) into and now i will order another set to finish.Thank you for these containers..they have saved my food and make my pantry lookgreat!"
I love these!! They are big enough to fit a 10 pound bag of sugar AND still fit in my cabinet. They were easy to clean and I love that they come with their own scoops. The scoops are easy to read both from the outside (on the sides) and the inside (on the back side). My only complaint is one of the containers was a bit concaved on the sides but I just used it for Bisquick since it's plenty of room for the big box when like that. Otherwise these are awesome! Definitely suggest them to those who need xL containers.
"During the pandemic, I've been trying to organize my pantry. Ordered these with trepidation due to the low price, but was I surprised when then arrived! Amazingly well made, sturdy feeling and heavier-than expected material. All lids fit and closed well. Each container came with scoop/measurer. Stacked well. Feel like they will last a very long time. If you are hesitating, go ahead and get them. The risk is just $22. I think you will be pleasantly surprised, as I was. A great product."
"I rarely do reviews, but these are wonderful containers! Love the extra measuring cups! They now come with spacers that keep them from 'sticking together' during shipping. I adore these and just ordered four more. I buy in bulk, which is difficult to use unless you have a convenient location. Pulling down a huge bulk bag every time discourages me from using the product. If I wait too long, the food expires. Now I am using my bulk regularly and refilling when I need! Two thumbs up!"
"Our pantry had become infested with tiny cigarette beetles and we were looking for air-tight, sturdy and sealing containers. These insects hitchhike from stores and can eat through bags and even plastic bags. Not all containers seal like these. vtops have a gasket type top and kept bugs out and food fresh. We ordered three sets and will likely buy more. Great lifetime warranty."
"I needed containers to fit my cupboard where I store flour, sugar, etc. The containers are 7"" x 7"", and my my shelves are 14-1/2"" deep, so two of these fit nicely, one behind the other. They are very well made, and the tabs fold down and click tightly. The containers each came in a sleeve of plastic bag, so I didn't have any problem getting them apart. They were packed well for shipping and came exactly when they said they would. The only question I had was how many containers were in each order. The description said 4 pieces, so I wasn't sure if they were counting each lid as a ""piece"". There were 4 containers and 4 lids."
"These containers are the perfect size and shape for storing flour, sugar, etc. Fit well on my lazy-Susan undercounter shelves. I have had a problem with mice chewing through the paper sacks, so these prevent that plus keep out unwanted moisture that's in kitchen air. The scoops that came with them were an added bonus, and I LOVE the labels and marking pen, too. Just ordered more."
"I bought two sets, this large container (for flour--ap, bread, whole wheat, and rye) and a 16-container set for various other dry ingredients (I have about six kinds of rice, cornmeal, polenta, and other stuff). Their square/rectangular shape and stackability assure an efficient use of space (I had an assortment of round containers). I noted that some reviewers thought the containers were too opaque to allow the contents to be seen; I didn't find the opacity to be an issue in determining the containers' contents. I have labeled the containers (even with clear containers, cornmeal and polenta can look the same, as do ap and bread flour)."
"These are perfect for 5# bags of flour. I was hesitant to purchase these due to reviews that said they were hard to open & pull apart. I have NO strength and the mfr must have listened to previous reviews and improved their product-KUDOS! These were wrapped securely and came apart easily and are easy to open and close, effortless almost. The latches secure easily. Great containers! I hope the mfr continues to listen bc I would love to see these in larger (double or triple even) sizes!"
"These containers are easy to open and close, no prying needed, so much easier to get into and out of, especially for those with any hand problems or arthritis. They are very suitable for bulk foods, flours, sugar, and more. the full-sized openings make it very easy to scoop out with larger measuring scoops and spoons, especially if you are a baker, no matter what you are making. They are durable, and easy to clean, too. Thank you for such helpful containers."
"Really happy with these storage containers. They come with a measuring cup, chalk labels, and pen. I actually dismissed the labels and pens for a month or so because I thought they would not be decent. However, I started using the labels (there are plenty of extra) on my other storage containers, pen writes nice and label is nice and thick. So happy with this brand that I ordered the smaller size containers for my other dry goods. Highly recommend!"
"I bought two sets of 4 to store cat/dog kibble to maximize freshness. Each 176 oz container will hold the scoop (provided) plus 5 pounds of kibble the size of peas. Easy to open/close and much nicer to deal with than the original pet food packaging. They also stack well in our pantry and are easier to tote than the whole 15-lb bag. We did have a wee bit of trouble separating the containers upon arrival from the shipper. Although you can see the containers are translucent, my wife affixed the labels that were provided. Minus 1 star for ease of cleaning since the lids are not dishwasher safe, but not a big deal because we prolly won't ever wash them."
"These are really great storage containers! I needed something for my baking supplies. I buy a lot of my baking supplies in bulk and had a hard time finding containers that would fit the entire package. These fit the brown sugar, powdered sugar and baking soda that I buy. I love that they also came with labels, a marker and measuring scoops! The tops fit very snugly so I'm not worried about my brown sugar getting hard."
"These containers are great for large flour/grains/sugar storage for bakers. Since they are on the larger side, they are more ideal for long term pantry-style storage with nice airtight lids perfect for the 1 gallon bags. The material is very smooth so the fine powders don't stick as easily as other storage containers I've used, so clean-up is very simple."
"Just had to rave about these containers!! I am constantly looking for more efficient ways to store items in my kitchen. These containers let me take advantage of the large open space under my sink, and easily access items for baking whenever needed. The containers lock securely, and I have no doubt will keep flour, sugar, etc. all fresh. Love them so much, I just ordered another set! The inclusion of individual scoops for each container is also a lovely nice touch! Very happy customer!"
I bought some of these to protect food from pantry moths. They worked well and I have invested in more to start a small food stockpile. They are easy to clean. The only thing I wish is that the large containers had handle on top so I could easily lift them off the floor.
"Was looking for a larger set of food storage containers for items like whey protein powder which I buy in large bags whose zip seals always break. Also, it is so much easier to scoop powder out of a large square rigid container! These are truly perfect and fit perfectly on our pantry shelves. Also great for storing different things like crackers and chips that can so easily get stale if kept in their original bags."
"These canisters are awesome! They are wonderful space savers. For years I‚Äôve had to contend with round or large at the top narrow at the bottom storage containers. None have worked especially well. I saved so much cupboard space I can actually get another container on the shelf. And they are the perfect height. These containers are well made with a tight fitting lid‚Äîperfect for storing rice, beans, flour, sugar, etc. And they are dishwasher safe. I even used the heated dry cycle. These are so great, I‚Äôm ordering another set."
"I had purchased the Vtopmart Cereal Storage set (used one for bran flakes, one for rolled oats, and the other 2 are perfect for 5 pounds of flour each (all purpose and whole wheat). So I ordered this set to continue on the road to an organized pantry. There are enough container and enough variety of sizes to make me happy. I have stored pastas and noodles, dried beans, rice, sugar, instant mashed potatoes, crackers, etc. When I open a box of something, I put whatever is unused into one of the containers and feel very secure that the contents will be fresh and protected from any possible insect problem. (I have never had insects in anything, but live in south Florida and used to keep my flour in the freezer and sugar in the fridge ""just in case"".) With this container set, I feel no need to do that anymore. Hand washed or dishwasher washed, they are simple to clean. Highly recommended."
"I envisioned the more rigid, clear plastic when I placed my order & was thrilled with the cheap price. When it arrived, I realized it is the more pliable, somewhat opaque plastic (similar to Tupperware). I had also envisioned larger containers, but they were half the size I had thought they were. I did not unpack it, but it looked like the lids would be airtight. It is probably a quality product, it just wasn't what I was wanting. I returned it."
"Very disappointed with this product. If you check the picture of the containers advertised they are Chrystal clear, these are made from a very thick plastic that you can hardly see thru and the sizes are not the same as advertised. The containers are very small this will bereturned to Amazon A S A P!"
I ordered a few different sets from this company and all seem really airtight so far. I like how they stack and am loving the label options. My pantry is looking really organized. Yay!
"Now that I received the product, I'm suspicious of the number of positive reviews. It's true what many reviewers said- that the bins are smaller than they seem in the pictures, and that they are not as clear as pictured. But what bothered me most was how difficult it is to put the lids on. They do not easily click in place. It couldn't be done without cradling a bin upside down in my arms and pressing very hard, not practical for when it's full of sugar! And as I was pressing the tabs as hard as I could I saw that all the pressure was on the thin plastic hinges, which would not last long like this. This leads me to what came to be a bigger complaint for me. When I initiated a return I simply got a message that it is not eligible for a return. This was a surprise, seeing that it was a Prime purchase, so I dug in, and could not find any return policy stating this, on the page of the product or the seller. Seems dishonest to me! At least after an hour and a half I was able to get in touch with an Amazon representative who gave me a refund, but I feel bad for the others who didn't have time to fight for their refund."
Everything here is from there!!! I love it all
"Ok I admit I didn't read all the reviews. My in-laws were coming to visit and I was in a rush to get my cabinets organized. So I went off by the stock photo and ordered these thinking they were just like those you see in the amazing before and after pantry photos on pinterest. These containers are not clear at all. They are frosted. They are just tall Tupperware with better lids. The labels are ok but the white marker doesn't have a sturdy tip so when you write with it, it doesn't look clean and sharp. The labels are in different designs which, for someone as anal as I am, its annoying. I like consistency and cohesiveness. I really wanted these to be super clear but I was in a bind and kept my order. **A word of advice because I saw many reviews saying they got a box with small containers instead. I swear I thought the same. They come stacked inside one another. So they appear to all be little. I assure you they aren't. You have to take the time to actually unpack it and you'll see they are indeed assorted sizes all perfectly nestled in each other* They do seal nicely and keep my coffee, almonds and granola all neat and easy to find. But the tapered shape of the containers don't allow for an even fit in your cabinets. The lids are bulky so it takes up space beside it whereas you cant line up the containers side by side like books on a shelf. Eh."
"These storage containers are great! They're sturdy and hold way more than it appears. The labels made my baking cabinet look 100% better organized than ever before-- I would buy them again and definitely recommend them! ps: I have the other containers similar to these that hold 5 lbs of flour each, and those are perfect, too!"
"Bought these on ‚Äúdeal day‚Äù and was skeptical until I used them. Each Lid locks on all four sides for a snug ‚Äúair tight‚Äù fit. Easy to clean and durable. The included labels and chalk pen make it easy to identify ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù items. Labels and matching containers give the pantry and laundry rooms much needed organization and are Pinterest worthy. I used the containers for all sorts of dry good items such as coffee beans, flour, Bisquick, and Tide Pods. I definitely recommend these affordable containers in all sizes."
"I love my containers and the lids that go with them. I purchased a different item a couple of years ago with hard plastic. Two of which cracked. So, I bought these and they are well made and do the job quite nicely, with labels and a white marker that come with them. When I got my first order, there was a place to register the warranty. Please do that. Also, you will have to have the information off the box, so do not throw that away. Register your containers. It is so worth it. The company was fabulous to deal with too. When I got around to washing the containers and filling them with my pantry items, I noticed that one had the lip chewed off (probably in the manufacturing). I notified the company and because I had the warranty that was registered, I sent a picture and they sent me a whole new set. The people were very nice too. So, try that with another container company. It will never happen, but these folks were terrific. I highly recommend the product, as well as the company."
"I love these storage containers. They are good to look at, durable and worth every penny. I used them in my cabinet that was very unorganized. I had opened packages of dried beans on one side and packages of grains and dried powered mixes on the other side. Things would spill over and look terrible. This is part of a renovation in my kitchen so, when my cabinets are restored they will look amazing. I plan on purchasing another set to complete the upper cabinets as well and finish this cabinet. They seal well and come in different sizes. The seal will definetly keep everything out, and freshness in, as well as, you know what's in the container. And, the labels are an added touch. The taller ones don't fit in my kitchen cabinet, however, after my kitchen renovation, they will look fabulous on my new counters. I've sent the pictures to all my friends of the finished cabinet and they are super envious. Don't walk to purchase these containers, run!"
"I got these for the entire purpose of ridding my cupboards of pantry moths. They started getting horrible and nothing I was doing was getting rid of them. Thankfully, these worked absolutely perfectly, and every single moth has disappeared. No more throwing out good food! They're also pretty cute and I like the labels a lot. Just know that once you write on the label, you can't wipe it off - so be sure to only label staple items that you know you're going to get over and over. It's also so much better to have absolutely everything in the cupboards and drawers organized. These gave me peace of mind in multiple ways."
"These containers are great. Even though the containers come in a couple different sizes, the lids are all the same - no searching for the matching lid. I washed them by hand and let them air dry before using. Each container holds way more than you would think. I combined 3 open packages of rice in one container (yeah, I don't know why I had three open bags). The lids fit snuggly and the clips keep them locked in place. Very easy to open and close. The chalkboard labels are so fun to use. They are big enough to write the name of the contents, expiration date and some brief instructions. If you make a mistake, the chalk marker wipes off with a damp cloth. My only issue is, I wish the containers did not taper at the bottom. I feel like I could fit more containers in my cabinet with less wasted space if they had straight sides. Overall, I am VERY happy with this product. I will add photos soon."
"I am reviewing this purchase over a year after purchasing. I‚Äôll admit I have taken into consideration supply chain issues and materials being poorer quality since the CV19 took the world by storm. However, apparently as humanity we still want to complain about stuff as crazy as storage containers. Any picture whether house or product or people is subject to look different at different angles. To call it deception is funny. If we look at all the pictures we can tell they aren‚Äôt window after windex clear. However they are clear and see through. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong a broken lid in shipment and all those types of things sometimes most times are not the fault of the company but of the shipping carrier. Yes they are small but I saw that when I purchased them and wonder how that isn‚Äôt noticeable in the pictures. I knew the biggest would not hold cereal which is why I had cereal containers from Walmart. Never had an issue with any of the lids or containers and trust I have a heavy handed teen who uses these. Still going strong which is how I ended up back on the product. Ended up purchasing other brand because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention (yup I‚Äôm accountable for my mistake). Went back to orders to order correct ones which are these. If you don‚Äôt like them just send them back, Amazon is great at returns. I just returned the incorrect ones from another company no problem. When I‚Äôm looking for reviews of items I want to know whether the product works, and what the quality of the used product is. That‚Äôs how we get an honest feel for something we are buying. People complaining about a product they didn‚Äôt research enough or even didn‚Äôt like upon arrival because of the color does not help anyone know if the product works or not.  So if you‚Äôre looking for a review to help you know if these are good containers, absolutely they are and they last. I‚Äôm only purchasing more because we are in a new home with more space to store things. The only complaint you see here is about the complaints that don‚Äôt have anything to do with whether the product is good, lasting or any of those things that help when purchasing."
"I bought these to help me get my pantry organized. My pantry is next to my garage and I saw we had a mouse problem in there. I took almost everything out and bought 3 packs of these (gulp). $100 later, Im'm pleased with it. Didn't want to spend that money, but I am pleased. And as my daughter said, I got 3 packs for the price of one pack at the Container store. And these are VERY sturdy. I think this is going a long way to help with my mouse in my pantry problem."
"I have a ton of small and medium size bags for all my baking ingredients. Since they were in cardboard boxes or paper bags, I always hated the constant mess from spills and the messy, inefficient storage. I have a very large set I use for my flour mixes. But I wanted to bring the same level of organization to my ""every day"" ingredients as I do my speciality ingredients. In less than half an hour, I have nicely organized and stackable containers for all my regular flours, nuts, and ingredients. Nothing is sitting out, nothing spills on the shelves. It's very tidy. There's a handy group of labels and a pen so I can mark what's in the container, too.  A neat surprise was a number of these containers fit in the over-door shelves, which helps keep pecans and walnuts from dropping on the floor. I very much appreciate this!"
"I picked these up because I recently started baking. I mean, I have a house now, why would I not? I am really into making breads with almond flour. I tend to stay away from regular flour as I had weight loss surgery 4 years ago, and follow the Bariatric Keto plan which has helped me keep off the weight I lost.  I have lots of ""Different"" things I need to use to cook, like Psyllium powder, etc. so I picked these up to try and keep my pantry clean. They are easy to use, though the lid did cause me a slight problem in the beginning.  There are various sizes, and it comes with a pen and stickers so you can label everything (Do not be me and miss that part at first....I wrote on the containers which also works haha).  Only gripe I had was they were a bit difficult to pull apart, even though each is wrapped in some plastic. Other than that, I love these containers,"
"I really like these containers. If you read reviews that tell you the lids don't fit- they do. Just line them up properly, then close two opposite sides at the same time, first say, east and west, then north and south or vice-versa. The lids will not pop into place as we in the states have become accustomed to. They o work beautifully however.  I will say though, that 1) the company tells you upon receipt that if you give them your email address they will give you a coupon for something else in their store. They do not, neither will they give you the code if you ask for it. And 2) these containers are see-through, but not clear as shown. This does not bother me as they are still well made, sturdy and safe. They're BPA free and dishwasher safe as well. I would actually like a second set as I've expanded my keto pantry and they fit the bill nicely for my needs."
"These are very sturdy. They stack nicely and help keep the pantry organized. I liked them so much I bought another set. Pros: Stack nicely Durable Great size variety Con: I wish they had a set of all extras small because I could use more of those, but don't want to buy a 3rd set of these just for the few small ones."
"Received my containers today and after reading so many reviews saying they had gotten defective products I was praying mine were good. They were! I am very pleased with them so far. The right size for what I needed them for...mostly snacks for the Grandkids. We do not buy the giant packs, these would not be good for those. I want to use some for powdered sugar, brown sugar, small bag of flour and small bags of sugar. I don‚Äôt use large amounts at a time. Going to use the small ones for chocolate chips...etc. I‚Äôm happy and will be watching to see how they hold up.  I‚Äôm wondering if some people were not too rough with them. I snapped the short ends on and then gently pulled down on the long ends until they snapped into place...no problems with a one but I will be careful with them. They are not too flimsy though, not top quality but not cheap quality either. Great for the price.  I will answer the questions about them being airtight, easy to clean, and durability after I have had them awhile."
A friend recommended I get these storage containers after I reorganized my pantry. I had a mish mash collection of containers and wanted to spiff it up a bit. These containers are great. They come with the chalkboard stickers and the chalk marker. They stick really well and the marker wipes off easily when I goofed up. The lids seal and lock on tightly but are easy to open. The containers look really nice in my neat pantry now.
I absolutely LOVE my new Vtopmart food storage containers. They were easy to clean before placing the food in them. The labels and pen that came with each set (3 sets) were also very easy to apply or re-apply if I had them on crooked. You can also register them with the company for a life time warranty. I would most definitely repurchase this again.
"I fell into the trap of wanting my pantry to look 'Pinterest perfect'. Well, I needed to be practical (so no glass because I am clumsy) and I needed something visually appealing yet sturdy enough that wouldn't break if (and when) I drop it. This is the ticket! I have bought numerous sizes and the quality doesn't disappoint. The key is to wash thoroughly when you recieve them, by hand, and let them completely dry out. I had them laid out for probably 4 or 5 days to ensure no water was left inside. Then I filled them up! All in all, great buy when you want the Pinterest look on a budget AND you're clumsy like me üòÅüôÑüòÇ"
I've been using these containers in all sorts of different sizes for about 5 years now. Other containers are being phased out and when I needed more containers for staples I was storing because of fewer grocery shopping trips during COVID I ordered more of these.  I love the way you can wash them in the dishwasher. I love that they snap easily but firmly closed so that you know your container is closed. I also really love the fact that they are rectangular or square (depending on the size) and really fit packed together in a cupboard without wasting space. And they stack well.  I never even consider another type of container.
We needed a better way of storing all those random open boxes and bags of dried goods. These save the food item from going stale and make for great organization in the cabinets/cupboards. We are able to find what we need easily without knocking stuff around and onto the floors. The containers are made of a sturdy plastic. The lids snap easily. They stack well and fit nicely in most shelf spaces. I will probably be buying more soon for more organization in our pantry spaces.
These containers are wonderful! Check out the before and after pictures! I purchased three sets to contain all of my food items. I don‚Äôt have a pantry so making the best use of my cabinet space is important. I‚Äôm also anticipating food to last longer in these airtight containers. I‚Äôm not crazy about my handwriting so I decided to print labels rather than use the ones provided. Glue stick worked great to adhere them. I highly recommend these containers. My only wish is that I could buy a set of just the small ones. I need just two more to complete my shelves. There‚Äôs a super variety of sizes and they stack so well - especially when you alternate the heights so the lids don‚Äôt meet.
"I haven't put the labels on yet and I'm not done organizing quite yet. But here's the progress, before and after pictures attached. Doing this much has already brought some serenity to my life. I feel so much less stressed already! I can't wait to have it fully organized. I'm also doing my cabinets in the kitchen as well. These containers are amazing!"
"Easy to use, easy to stack, labels can be reused. Special pen for writing on stickers, that can be erased and rewritten. Keeps bugs out of your food and creates more room in your cabinets. Check the sizes in comparison with your cabinet shelf height. Recommend purchasing one set and then you will have a better idea on which ones you need next. Will be purchasing more in the future."
"This is what has been missing from my life haha! I feel like I've always seen people who are overly organized (I'm not one of those) and thought how nice it must be to have the time. This product makes it so easy to organize a pantry/cupboard! I bought one and loved it so much I bought another the same day. I regained so much space! Plus it made everything so pretty. They really thought of everything and I appreciated the way the box made you open it, so you had the pen and labels immediately. The organization and liners between make it easy to remove and fly though organizing your stuff. So good!!"
""
"I bought these for our camper so we could have open food in the pantry and was hesitant due to the price, but they have been amazing! We have flour, sugar, marshmallows, graham crackers, cereal, coffee and so one and we have had no issues! Before we purchased these, we had ants in all of our pantry food and that was after 2 weeks. Now with these containers it's been 4 months and right through the heart of summer in the south and zero ants!"
When they arrived and were stacked as in the photo displayed they appeared to be all the same size. Reached out to the supplier and they assured me once I start to unstable them they will be different sizes. That was correct. I‚Äôve seen other reviews where they returned them thinning the same thing. I stack them n they are variation of sizes. They are similar to a Tupperware material and are not completely clear. There is a slight haze or fog to the color but that does not bother me at all. They will serve their purpose
"I have been slowly switching everything into plastic containers. They look great in a cubbard, they protect your food, and you lessen chances of attracting bugs (especially living in apartments). They stack easily and seal well. They are as easy to clean as any other plastic containers. I like the chalkboard stickers that come with it! I have used them and washed and used them again! I can easily find what I am looking for! Definitely worth it!"
"I haven‚Äôt had these long but so far they are great. They are easy to see through, the lids fit and lock tightly and they were easy to clean. I like the wipe off labels but the tip of the pen is a bit flimsy so it doesn‚Äôt write clearly. That‚Äôs not a huge deal; I can read it what I‚Äôve written well enough. I‚Äôm enjoying these and have freed up some space in my pantry by stacking them."
"The containers are fantastic!! I bought a couple to store some baking items and loved them so much I bought the 15-piece set. Now anything that originally came in a cardboard box or paper, like rice, pasta, flour, is now stored in a Vtopmart airtight container. Not only will it keep things fresher longer I don't have to worry about bugs and everything is neat and organized. The containers come with some labels so I can mark what's in each container. I would like to see some small sizes, like 1 or 2 cup containers that could hold small pieces of food or things like baking soda or powder."
"For years I have avoided using the cute canisters for many reason. One is that moths can still get into the airtight containers, or because I have more than just flour, tea and sugar to sort. I can use my open shelves for some of this now. They are easy to notice/use and the snap locks are faily sturdy. The labels are black with a white pen to mark them.  The only suggestion I would make is having more than just one of the really tall ones (that I used for cereal)."
"Wow , that would be the default expression after you use them in your shelves. Can't believe how much hey have helped my wife to remain organized , save space, add better and nice look to the kitchen shelves. You would definitely regret thinking why you haven't used until now. I gave 4 star on durability just thinking how strong the hinges of covers remains strong over the period. I am expexting the covers should remain hood more than couple of years. They look strong though but don't want to overrate until I spent riight time using them. Would recommend to rinse with soap water and shake to clean instead of any sponge scrubber to avoid loosing clear and transparent look."
"I love these containers so much, I just bought another set. I had been wanting to organize my pantry for the longest time, but couldn‚Äôt bring myself to spend that much money on containers. I like that I can see what is inside the container and easily tell when it‚Äôs time to restock. I love that these are different sizes and they stack well. The labels are super cute and I like that everything looks uniform and organized. I am very pleased with this purchase."
"Before and after photos! I love these! I have a weird corner pantry, very hard to find storage ideas. This set worked beautifully, let‚Äôs me see what I have at a glance, instead of having to dig thru things shoved in the back corner, bags of items that wanted to fall out, cans buried under bags of things. Read some complaints of these not being clear, but as they are behind a closed door, and I can still see what is in them, along with the provided labels, they work perfectly for me."
Air right. Smart looking. Good sized. My only complaint is the design of the container. The tops are so much wider than the bottoms. It leaves an unusable space between containers that could be used for more storage. The kids also add about a quarter of an inch on each side. I‚Äôd there were the same size too to bottom they would be perfection.
"I recently got a baking station with open shelving. I wanted a storage set for the staples- all purpose flour, bread flour, wheat flour, white sugar, brown sugar, etc. This does the trick. I do think I may need to upgrade my flour containers- I used the 4 big ones (not the tallest noodle one), but it doesn't fit a full bag of flour, and they aren't pourable. And I go through flour. But otherwise, it's perfect. I was able to use it to bake some cookies this weekend and it was so convenient for the things I needed to scoop. Plus, I can see how much I have and I love the labels that came with it. It may not be exactly what I needed (sizing for the flour containers and pourable tops), but it is exactly what I ordered and very good, especially with the price vs quantity/quality."
"No more loosing the lid because all the lids match in this set and there are various sizes. They're compact and don't take up much room in the pantry and cupboard. They come with black labels and a white dry erase marker. They clean easily in the dishwasher without worrying about them melting. I'm going to buy another set next payday. In addition to the labels, I also tape directions on the side."
I read the reviews and am very happy with this set. Everything came well packed and nothing was broken. The containers are a good thickness. There might be a bit of give but I don't feel like they are at all flimsy.  We have some snap top containers and I really like this style lid. The seals are light blue if that matters to anyone. I was expecting a more true blue but these are fine. I'm going to order the set of largest sizes to finish off the pantry. Definitely a good buy for our use.
I bought two sets because I am obsessed with organization items in my new home. I was surprised that using these really did add space to my cabinets. I wish I could order just some of the taller ones and just a few of the smaller ones without all of the set.
"This is a fantastic container set at a very reasonable price. All 15 pieces have the same size interchangeable lids. They come with nice black labels and white marker - labels can be wiped clean with alcohol and re-written if you change contents. The lids snap on and seal very well and I can see all the content levels easily. They were a bit hard to pull apart when I got them, but that‚Äôs not a big deal. I loved them and bought a second set so my cupboard is super organized now."
"Very nice set. Some sizes are a little small for say a bag of flour or a bag of sugar but it's less than a cup difference. Airtight, stackable, great set. Love the labels w the chalk like marker."
"I love these even more than I‚Äôd hoped to. They all use the same sized lids! Amazing, right? No more digging for the right size lid because they all work for each container. Who knew a simple thing like this could make me so happy? Buy these :)"
"I have searched for accessible storage for my pantry, and am so glad that I found these containers. Not only are they attractive, but they make it simple to see what is inside. They are compact, and stack perfectly. There is ample room now to move all of my most used products to shelves which make it unnecessary to use a step stool every time I want to get baking supplies or coffee beans. Now that I have completely emptied and inventoried my pantry, I am ordering one last set to store the final few items. Perfect!"
"Love this containers. I ordered a smaller set the first time and liked them so much went back and ordered another larger set. These are air tight. Easy to get on and off. I have a hard time gripping things sometimes and these are easy to unsnap. Love the extra labels . I store everyday snacks as well as flour, sugar etc. so convenient and easy to see what‚Äôs in it ."
I am so happy I purchased these. I bought two sets. The lables and marker that is included is a nice addition. They fit in my cabinet perfectly. They are airtight. I have cookies in one and they stay nice and crunchy. (I don't like soft cookies.) Very easy to clean. Would recommend.
"Love these storage containers - they've really improved organizing our breakfast cereal area. Four different sizes, all stackable. Easy to optimize space, vs before when even a small amount of cereal ended up still taking up a giant container. All share the same tops, so no searching for one that matches the bottom. Only weakness: one large container only, and that one will not fit the family size cereal boxes increasingly popular; but just have to spread over 2 containers. Overall very satisfied."
"These containers saved my pantry! They arrived quickly, were easy to clean, and they make my pantry so organized and functional. I love how every size container uses the same sized lid. Granted, this is the most I have ever spent on plastic containers, but they were worth it.  They did appear smaller in size than I expected, but looks can be deceiving. It‚Äôs amazing how much they hold. I love the taller container for spaghetti, and I‚Äôve used the others to organize grains and pastas all the way down to popcorn and snack bars.  Great product. Worth the money. I‚Äôd love to see other storage solutions they offer."
"I'm very pleased with the quality of this set. My only complaint is that I'd prefer to have more of the larger containers. I did struggle to find things that would fit in the smaller ones without having to break up the contents across multiple containers. For reference, the small ones basically hold a bag of Nestle morsels."
"These work great. Our food has lasted much longer in these containers, and they‚Äôre skinnier which makes it easy to fit in our cupboards. A few of them are very tall, so be careful if you don‚Äôt have room that way. They‚Äôre easy to clean, but it takes a while to dry (unless you take out the rubber seal and air dry that way - I‚Äôm too lazy)."
"Battled my last round with Pantry Moths. I have cleaned, boiled, sprayed the pantry several times and it seems just when I think I got them all, I get another batch. I can toss out the carboard cartons and put in the tight sealed containers so they cannot multiply or ruin my pantry products. I also bought Pantry Moth traps.....Good By Suckers!"
"I love the shape and the lids are easy to pop on and off. The mouth of the container is large and easy to fill into or pour from. The only difficulty I've seen is that the lids are bulkier than the container so they catch on one another when stored tightly together. I had to leave some room between containers or when I removed one, it would bump another one out of place."
These storage containers are great! I'll have to order a ton more because I'm really happy with how the pantry looks now as opposed to before when everything was in its original packaging. Unfortunately my containers came without the marker and labels but one quick email to the company's customer support solved that issue. Very satisfied with the product and company!
I love these containers! They are easy to open and close. I had a little problem with the pen not working and contacted their customer service. They were very prompt with their replies and sent me a replacement pen quickly. I highly recommend these containers and company.
I'm all about a bargain and when these went on sale we gave it a go. The cookies that we put in one have been fresh for weeks. The labels that came with the set are nice. The lids are sturdy and seal well.
I hesitated on buying this because of the reviews and I can honestly say those reviews are trash. These are amazing yes they are hard to take apart when you recieve but it does an amazing job at keeping your food fresh. And for the ones that want clear containers go for glass ones and stop leaving bad reviews saying they are not clear
Using the containers in my pantry. Easy to use and clean up. Lids clasp tightly. Love that it comes with stickers and chalk pen. The chalk ink comes off easily with a damp rag. Nice assortment of sizes. Great value for the price. A must have for a pantry or any place you are looking to organize.
"Loving my Vtopmart storage containers. I've purchased 4 different sizes so far and my storage has went from chaos to perfectly organized. This is one of several cupboards that I've reorganized. Easy to open and close and airtight! Some reviews say hard to unpack - each container is individually wrapped in plastic to protect from scratching, just pull them slowly straight up to unpack. Lids have a soft rubber seal to make them airtight. When aligned correctly they seal easily."
These are very nice to organize your pantry on a budget! They even came with some cute sticker lanes and a chalk pen! I really enjoyed getting my pantry all organized with these clear storage bins! Great to see how full your supplies are! They do feel a little cheaper plastic but they seem to be doing a great job!
"These are so nice. Sturdy, good sizes. Only complaint is I wish there were 2 tall containers for pasta. Spaghetti and fettuccine."
I bought these as a housewarming gift and they are great! Much appreciated and used. The various sizes are great for storing dry good and are air tight and BUG proof! I am thinking of getting some for myself too! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!
"Very affordable product but you don‚Äôt sacrifice quality! When comparing to similar products, I was hesitant to order at first because I wanted something easier to open but I needed more containers and an affordable price - this set was perfect! I did run into an issue when the set was damaged during shipment. Vtopmart Direct was very responsive and made things right. Very reputable seller and would order from again without hesitation."
"I am loving finding things in my cabinet to put in these and label them , they stack and make me extra room to fit more . The labels are nice and you can read easy with the white marker that comes with this and the labels."
"So far so good! I wish only that there were 2 of the really tall ones, but they are absolutely serving the purpose they intend. They are made of good durable plastic, not flimsy, the tops fit tight. They sent enough labels to change if necessary with the ""chalk"" marker and the labels are of great quality as well. So satisfied with my purchase."
"Los compre para probar porque me habian dicho de ellos, me encantaron, sellan super bien, facil de limpiar, los rotules y me gustan mas todavia, la comida se conserva fresca y crujientes, LOS RECOMIENDO a OJOS CERRADOS, muy buen compra."
These containers serve their purpose well. We got them to protect our food after a pantry moth infestation and these containers keep the nasty things out. I love the little chalkboard style labels- I‚Äôve even used them on other containers because they look so good!
"These do all they say: snaps make it leak-proof (i dropped 1), keeps food fresh longer, goes in freezer & fits in cupboards well. I appreciate the smaller sizes bc our leftovers aren't usually much quantity. Good value The tiniest size is good for abt 2 Tbsp of something - which we don't keep, so we use them for office supplies & herbs."
"I did in fact get a full set. The missing 3 very small round containers, turned up under a my coffee table. Go figure. I must have kicked them somehow. The lids seal very tight. I do not think that there will be any leakage. Dishwasher, microwave and freezer safe."
"Great set for the money! I bought the container to use for lunches and leftovers. I will save money on buying foil, plastic bags etc.. plus good for the environment. I like the lids and how easy they are to close with no leaks."
Storing these bad boys empty is best done in a drawer because the lid situation is not for stacking on a shelf. The only downside I‚Äôve noticed is that the lids seal extra tight if the food is hot when you lock it on and refrigerate it. Wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher and all will be well.
"These containers have a really good seal.I love how these containers keep food fresh, even in the refrigerator. I hav stored I. Freezer with no problems. I do thaw food and remove lids before microwaving food. Really glad to finally get a useable set of containers."
I purchased this set of containers and they are great! The lids give a good seal and keep food fresh for well over a week. Cleaning is easy as I put them right in the dishwasher and also put them in the microwave. I like all the different sizes that are included as well.
I love these. My son can easily use them for his snacks at school. Very nice for lunches at work. The people saying they‚Äôre too small should‚Äôve read the dimensions in the description before ordering and leaving a 1 star review for the size of the containers.
"These are great! Easy to clean and see what you are storing in the fridge! Wish that the lids were a little easier to store, they slip and slide all over the cabinet creating a bit of a mess at times though‚Ä¶"
"These are great containers! They do not leak, they latch well, clean easily and there is a huge assortment of any kind of size you could imagine! These work perfectly for me to pack my lunch for work & try and do better with portioning. Recommend!"
These suckers are sturdy! They‚Äôre tight seal=leak proof! They wash well in the dishwasher and such a great price! Love the variety of sizes you receive!
"I am so pleased with my new storage. I was upset bc I thought some of them were bigger than what they are bit after using them, I'm loved them."
"These containers are excellent, I highly recommend! Perfect sizes and store easily. I plan to buy another set just to have plenty for the whole family to use!"
I purchased these as a gift and she loves them. these containers really work. certainly an upgrade from what she had. delivered sooner than expected
These are perfect size not to big not to small. Perfect to take the correct portion for work lunch.
For the price this is not a bad set. I wish there were larger potions included.
This little set was definitely a great value. The pieces come in various sizes that are practical in use. Easy to clean and really durable: our family has used them on a daily basis and we would purchase them again in the future.
Very reasonable priced. They don‚Äôt leak! Snap sides are quality
I love these. they are good quality and very useful.
Excellent seal. Good sturdy construction and a great value!
Great quality and sturdy product
"They are completely leak proof, all different portion sizes, easy to clean, etc."
as soon as i got them i was putting the lids on them and a lid broke right off the bat and some of the lids did not fit right would never buy this again
LOVE THESE FOR PACKING A WORK LUNCH
Quality product. Well made and works great
Love these containers for portion control. I cook all meals for the week on Sunday and use these to portion them out for the week. Perfect size and they go from freezer to microwave real well.
These are portion sized containers. Perfect for packing your lunch or meal prepping. These even come with tiny containers that would hold about 1 tablespoon of your favorite salad dressing.
Worker well
"I love the sizes, quality is great and am buying more."
"Great value, these are great for storage and loving how I can stack them and organize them in my fridge."
Easy to clean and use
All sizes fit perfect (as needed) into 6 meal prep lunch box.
Good deal if you need something quick
"I highly recommend these containers. They are exactly as described. Great way to organize snacks, refrigerated food and other items."
Love it
"These are great quality, and for the price I was shocked that they are so Amazing! Will be repurchasing in the future!"
Too many of the smallest size. However over all the product is great.
Great variety for portion control. No large containers but all are very well made and Great sealability! I would highly recommend purchasing!
These were a Christmas gift for my niece she loves them. Perfect for small apartment
So far I haven't seen anything faulty in design or performance.
Love this product so far. I use them mainly for my daughters lunches and fruits and veggies. The fruits and veggies have reminded fresh longer without condensation. Have not had one leak with my daughters lunches. Perfect size for her snacks and lunches.
I use them everyday for my my husband and kids lunch. They have a perfect size for everything. If I ever need more will deff be these not flimsy or cheap feeling. Great price.
This product is nice
I have used them every day for storing food in my fridge. Lots of good sizes
The lids fit well and seem durable. I really like all the different sizes.
They work great.
Love these! Threw out old flimsy tupaware. Worth every dollar.
I needed containers to store make ahead meals and leftover. These are made very well and have numerous sizes.
I like these containers! I wish it came with maybe one or two bigger containers but other than that I love them!
No leaking. Perfect sizes for leftovers or for taking to work.
"Basic food containers, thick, good variety sizes."
Leftovers mostly
Looks good good tight fit
Pretty good quality ! But I was hoping for them to be a lil bigger
"Yes the product is very sturdy, leak proof and I like its dishwasher safe. Going to buy more"
The largest container is barely big enough for leftovers at dinner. But they are perfect for packing lunches.
I like how well packaged I was and the value for the variety of storage.
The sizes
Just what I needed
Bought this for my mom and they work great! Even came with labels that work after washing.
Perfect size
Excelente art√≠culo cierran perfectamente y es un tapado ideal para 1 o 2 porciones
Really good quality
She like them
Me gusto vinieron r√°pido pero pensaba q ten√≠a mas bowl grandes
Better than the dollar store
Awesome containers great 4everythung
Happy with it
Very good container easy to wash
Love them all
Leak proof.. snaps easy
"I liked the fact that you can put an entire 5 pound bag of flour into one of these containters. It isn't necessary to pour it in. The container is large enough that you can leave the flour in the original bag.  The lid seals tightly. I have been using them less than a month, so cannot comment on durability."
"Nice set of containers, true to size, with bonus accessories. But: One container arrived cracked-broken, as they're packed in a plastic bag with no padding and no product box. There is no BPA-free indicator stamped anywhere on the product. Product photos are deceiving, the plastic is semi-opaque and milky, it is in no-way crystal-clear."
I had to return them because they were not rated for food storage.
I disliked the way the description was worded. It seemed that the capacity (volume) was 5.2 L per container. But that is the total of the 3 containers. They seal very well.
"I bought these for sugar and flour countainers. After using them for several weeks I noticed my brownsugar had an off smell and flavor. I thought it was the package of brown sugar, but I found the same happened to the white sugar and the flour. I washed them again (after having washed them to begin with, and rinsed well) and the same bad smell and taste persisted. I do not recommend."
"These work great to store and organize the pantry! Tight click seal and just translucent enough to see what is inside the container. The labels that come with them are nice, but would have liked them to be a bit larger. Still works but if you are used to writing larger size, you'll have to work to make it fit on the smaller labels included. I was able to use the extra labels on my other airtight containers too, so that was a good positive thing! Overall happy with the product! Just would have liked the sticky labels to have been a bit larger.. :-)"
"should have gotten a few more.. the ones i bought are large enough to hold a full 10lb bag of sugar (and then some - prob holds 12-13lbs if you topped it off). they sit nicely together, stack well, and the seals are great. i like the sterlite brand 4 sided clamp seals on the smaller set i have, these are made very similar to the sterlite design with the silicone band in a channel lock rim.  the little scoop cups are a nice touch - they include 1 cup measurement markings on them. and the labels are really nice, almost like a vinyl or plastic material, so the included chalk marker works PERFECTLY on them. but fyi i tested the chalk marker on black post-it paper and it wasnt as vibrant.. its legible but doesnt look the same as it does on the included labels. but a caution, this chalk marker will quickly and easily rub off the labels. so i remedied that by slapping some clear shipping tape over the labels to ensure they last.. :)"
"My daughter bought these for herself. She researches everything & reads all the reviews before she buys anything. So I knew they were quality. I saw them at her house, & said I need them too. She sent me the link, so I would be sure to get the same. I'm very pleased. I use them now for sugar, flour & powdered sugar. I live in Florida, so it's important that everything be air tight, & they are. The set comes with labels, a writing tool & even the scoops for each container. I couldn't be happier, & plan to buy more."
"Really like these canisters. I had Indian Meal moths get in my kitchen - traced to a bag of sliced almonds I think was the first place infected. I don't know if they come in from outside or if they are brought in through food that is already infected. They laid larvae on the sprayed ceiling, any place that was not smooth like ridges on bowl lids. Very hard to get rid of. I now keep all dry foods in containers. But these needed a larger container than I could find in stores around here and they lock tightly shut."
Great size for flour and sugar! Tops are tight so will stay fresh and ready to use at any time. Easy to handle and not to heavy to lift even with 5lbs of sugar or flour in them. Will probably buy more in different sizes for other kitchen items that need secure storage.

"I have 3 large bags of dog food sitting on my counter (yes, they each eat something different). The reason they are on the counter is convenience for me. Since I do not have a lot of counter space I was looking for something that was air tight and would give me more room, easy to use, and held enough food so I didn't have to refill them every week. These containers work perfectly for my needs. They also look nice sitting on the counter. These were also a great price for 3, when I could have paid the same amount for one from other sellers. I will be purchasing more for my flour and sugar."
my old containers finally gave out . i could not replace the rubber seals so i tried these and im very happy. i also bought the extra tall two pack and they are for my ten pd bag of flour and the other for my big box of bisquick. room enough for the measuring cups as well and stackable. i will consider these when shopping for gifts or as containers for homemade treats that i bring to events.
The Quality of this product was much better that I had expected by the simple description on the website. The lid fits snuggly with a rubber-type seal. All four side have a lock that subs as a handle. These containers are very large and crystal clear. They come with labels you can make with the marking pen which is supplied. I recommend this product to my family and friends.
"I bought these after reading reviews and looking at other options that cost more. I‚Äôm glad I did. These are perfect. I have my flour, white and wheat, and sugar in them. Much better than trying to get straight out of the bags. They come with a really nice scoop for each and a marker to write what‚Äôs in them on the label."
I got these for storing dry goods long term. As far as I can tell they are what I wanted. You have to get things lined up just right which can take some getting used to when seating the lids. It makes me think the seals are as advertised. I wish there was a feature where stacking was secured by device design.  ETA; The chalk and labels went in the trash. Omit those and it could reduce the cost of the product.
"Holds more than 5 lbs of flour and 4 lbs of sugar. Nice large size. Lids goes on tight for good airtight seal. Only problem I had was that on arrival, I had a difficult time separating the two large canisters. I couldn‚Äôt pry them apart! I finally put them out on my deck in 20 degree weather. After several , tries, I finally got them apart. Also included are two scoops. Nice size and very useful."
These containers are fantastic. They are large enough to hold 5 lbs of a dry ingredient and thin enough to not be bulky. I ordered only one set before I realized how great these containers are. I am now ordering another set. They also come with a measuring cup for each container and labels and a pen if you choose to label your containers. Don't pass them up.
Needed containers to store bulk flour. These are a perfect size and the lids are very air tight and are very secure when latched. Each container also comes with a scoop to measure portions. Will buy again when needed.
"I really like so far! They are large enough to hold a whole bag(sugar, flour, etc). Lids fit well and I like the chalkboard labels and pen included! Can‚Äôt comment on durability, as I‚Äôve only had these for a few days."
This product is durable and the thickness is perfect. The sheerness is perfect to store flour and sugar in. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product. Organizing my pantry was never easier when using the large storage containers.
"I bake bread and hate the flour mess every time I owned a bag of flour. I keep several types of flour - rye, whole wheat, bread flour and regular flour. These are perfect! They hold tons of flour, and fit perfectly on my pantry shelf. I love that they come with individual measuring scoops and labels. The lids fit tightly, but are easy to open and close."
I really like the size. I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were going to be too big or too small. It fit standard size sugar bag and flour. Possibly a little more. I LOVED that it came with a scooper. Makes this product more efficient. Quality is great. I originally wanted glass but I have 3 little ones. So I thought plastic was more safe. I‚Äôm Completely satisfied with this product and I love
"I love that these storage containers came with cute little black labels with a white marker. Having them lined up in my pantry looks so cute. I can easily see how much I have left of any of my dry goods. I am using them for flour, 2 kinds, sugar, rice, instant mashed potatoes and marshmallows. They give my pantry a clean and organized look."
"I had purchased a set a over a year ago and I returned to get another. They are containers that are well sealed, easy to clean and very durable for long term storage. I also liked that they came with scoopers, labels and a chalk pen (cool bonus). I am using it for flour and rice storage and so far so good."
"√áame the very next day after ordering. Plastic containers are sturdy and lids seal tight. You just have to open and reseal it a few times to get it latched properly because of them being brand new. Labels and caulking pen comes with it ,also. Totally happy with them and would definitely buy again."
"Just received this set. Very happy with the size of the containers and they come with stickers so you can label them, bonus! bonus! bonus! The sizes were just what I was looking for to hold larger items like flour, sugar, pancake mix. I would absolutely buy these again if I have a need for more."
"Excellent packaging, highly recommend this Seller. Love the size, fits easily in any cupboard or pantry. Great for storing cookies, candy. Love the 4 locking sides of lid, very air tight, although cookies did dry out after a few weeks, wanted to see how long would stay fresh. Will probably order more of these-size."
"These are good quality. When I got them, the lids were a little warped because of the packaging. But once I got them, I put the lids on for a few days and just left them and the lids straightened out. I love how it comes with the little labels and marker. These are good and simple."
"These were a nice surprise. They came well packaged, included 3 graduated scoops, a pack of labels and a marking pen! Seem well-made and I really like the square shape as they fit better on the pantry shelves then the round ones. A 5lb bag of flour fills it abt halfway up."

"I've wanted affordable flour containers. I bake my own bread use a variety of flour, but wanted containers big enough to get measuring cups in them without spilling flour all over. These are perfect for me."
These are very solid and larger than I expected. (I'm not very good at visualizing sizes.) My only complaint is not with the product but with my failure to note that the lids come completely off. I prefer them to be hinged. They are a good product.
I'm surprised by how much I like these. They take up less space than the round canisters I had. I love the included measuring scoop and different sticker shapes for the labels. The opening is big enough to easily get stuff out. The lids are very secure with a latch on each side.
"Perfect for me! I‚Äôm learning how to cook so much stuff. I never had time for it when my (now grown) daughters were little. I‚Äôve noticed my canisters were way too small, so I bought these. They are the perfect size for flour, sugar & powdered sugar. Love, love, love these!"
"This is perfect storage for my brown sugar, puppy treats and tea bags. The 4 snap locks are easy to open and close. The kids go on and come off even easier. I used the measuring cups in my larger storage containers, these were a nice bonus"
"Just received the three canisters and so far, so good. They were well packed and the canisters are large enough to hold a 5lb. bag of flour. They appear to be durable and easy to clean. Also included are three 1 cup measuring cups, labels and a marker to label each canister."
I like the square storage containers much better than round. The dead space between round containers is now filled with my storables 100%. My round containers were airtight but I like that these have rubbery gaskets that ensure a tight seal. Sale price made them even better!
After buying other sets that I returned; I bought these and they are exactly what I needed. They are the perfect size for a 5 lb bag of flour and are airtight so everything stays fresh. They are stackable and wash well. I am sure they have multiple uses but I am using them as storage for baking staples. I would recommend them and I would purchase them again. Great product for the money
I ordered 3 of these to hold my various flours and cornmeal. These are big and roomy and hold a lot and are airtight. I think it can hold a 10 lb bag if you empty the bag of its contents in the container. Overall nice containers.
This is the second time I have ordered these containers and they are great. My last order arrived damaged and there is no way to order just a replacement lid. Can not contact the seller.
Th see storage containers are air tight & are the same size. They come with labels & a chalk marker to use on the black labels! I bought these for my mother for her birthday! I recommend these to anyone that likes to keep their food air tight!!
I love these. The top locks on all four sides. The labels and marker are a extra bonus. The containers are sturdy and perfect for a 5 lb. bag of sugar or flour. I recommend these.
"Once these units are unpacked, they should be great. Problem #1: 2 of the 6 units were damaged and NOT in shipping. That means the supplier shipped damaged goods. That is not what I expected from a higher end container company. Problem #2: The units are stacked 3 deep. I could not get them separated, it made me wonder if the damage above had been caused by someone else trying to separate them and the company simply restocked returned, damaged goods. I finally got them separated by working a chop stick between the units to break the vacuum. My wife likes these units so we are requesting replacements. Hopefully, these will arrive without damage. 2nd set arrived, no problems. Units separated as illustrated by their video. The lips showed no damage. Getting the tops to lock was difficult for the first couple of times, then they worked fine. I would order these again."
"These canisters are sturdy with tight fitting lids for dry products. They are square so there is no wasted shelf/counter space like there is with round containers. The 5lb capacity is great for large quantities, and it's easy to see what's inside. Labels and a marking pen came with the canisters, as did scoops with measurement markings. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"Oh my gosh these are amazing. I put noodles in one, rice in another and pancake mix. Air tight seal, square design makes them easy to store and stack and big enough face to write the label big enough to see. I am so thrilled. Even came with a measuring cup for each container."
"These storage canisters are great heavy duty, very sturdy Can hold a 5 pound bad of flour. and sugar The only thing to watch out far they are pretty tall they just barely fit between the shelves in my pantry."
It keeps flours fresh & room to fluff it up before using. They stack up great. Easy to clean the seal comes off also for easy cleaning the containers are light to carry which is important to clean. No BPA
These are so much easier to care for as well having a measuring cup for each container makes it great especially if one bakes a lot.
i love this product! the containers are strong and the lids have a tight seal. perfect for what i needed. i like them so much that i'm going to order another set.
I loved the fact that the containers were as big and roomy as they appeared in the advertisement. I purchase staples in bulk so being able see when I'm low is great.  The only downside is the fact that the plastic is so hard that the corner on two of the containers were broken. The lid was able to close nonetheless.
Just received my containers today! Love them so much already! Perfect size to fit all my flour and sugars. Love the cute labels and marker it comes with. Seal is very airtight. Easy to wash and clean. Had a flour emergency lol so bought these because they were the cheapest I found. Perfect for what I needed! Would definitely recommend!
These storage containers hold 7.5 pounds of flour in each and a full 10 pounds of sugar. They stack nicely in space saving fashion. I like them.
"I spent a good long time looking for canisters here on Amazon, and I'm glad we ultimately chose to go with this brand. They look great in our cabinets, come with 3 measuring cups and lots of labels. Well packed and delivered without incident. I highly recommend!"
"The sides would bend in when trying to close the tabs, but once closed they were alright. I still added some moisture packets in case"
I use this product to keep regular sized bread loaves in. This has been good for me as it's helped me keep my bread fresh through refrigeration without letting refrigerator condensation & moisture make the bread go bad faster.
They are big enough to hold a bag of sugar or flour. They don't take up much space in the cabinets and they are very sturdy. I like the measuring cups included and the labels. Great value.
"My hubby ordered two sets for mother's day for me. HATE open boxes/bags in the pantry, and these ar3 super nice. My kids hqve dropped them a few times and they remained closed!"
"Large, easily to fill and use from. Airtight so it keeps food safe even over long periods. Easily fits in my pantry with clear markings for product. I'm using them for sugar, flour and rice. I may get more for my pancake mix and nuts. Helps to keep my pantry sorted for easily finding what I need."
"Perfect for laundry essentials. I just refill instead of carrying that big bulky box. Comes with 3 measuring cups, stickers and chalk marker."
I have used various sizes with the snap lids and I love them. Best organizers I‚Äôve ever had . I‚Äôve reordered 3 times to expand the shelf life of my dry ingredients and pastas.
I bought them to store my protein powders and I love them so much. They're the perfect size to store a full bag! Keep thinking of buying more to store other dry foods in my pantry!
Tight fitting lids. Large capacity. One of them can hold a whole bag of tortilla chips if that helps with an idea of size lol
"These are really formidable containers, with snap on lids and lots of labels. They are working perfectly, and look great as well. Will buy more as my baking prowess increases!"
Containers have secure lids that lock into place. Labels provided are easy to use and functional. Size was exactly what I needed. I had no difficulty separating the containers from each other - whatever problem existed in the past (as described in earlier reviews) must have been corrected.
"These are perfect and durable. I had no issues so far. The tabs were easy to write on. A person can fit 5 pound whole bags of surgar or flour or what have you in the container without opening the bags. If you poured the flour, sugar or what have you in the canister then you can fit more than 5 lbs in the canister. . It also comes with measuring cups for each canister."
I was happily surprised to learn that the lids are air tight lock downs. I didn‚Äôt need any more little containers and it was great to find a set of big ones without having to get the little ones.
I make homemade noodles and pasta a lot. These are great for storing what I make fresh as well as bake because I freeze all my homemade noodles and pastas. Positively a WINNER!!
I bought these to hold my flour as I buy in bulk. They are great. Will be ordering another set for sugar.
"First order delivered with missing lids. Amazon was great, resent the order and it was great! Love Amazon Air tight and sturdy storage for my baking supplies."
"OK...full disclosure...I bought 2 different brands of food storage containers for my pantry. This brand is by FAR the best on the market! I love that the containers are clear and not opaque. It is very easy to see what is inside and how much of each product you have left. The labels are cute and random different shapes. I really liked that. The stickers for the labels were easy to remove. The chalk marker has a nice fine tip that makes label making easy to read. I also really like the closing mechanism on the containers. The other brand I bought was really a struggle to put the lids on securely. These, I have full confidence that when I reach for my rice and tip the container that the lid is snug and those nightmare accidental spills simply will not happen. The closure would even be easy for someone with arthritis or shaky hands to use. I highly recommend this product as it is 100% the best quality food storage container on the market. You will have a forever customer with me!"
"The ROLLS ROYCE of food storage! üíñüíñüíñ  Absolutely love these containers from Chef‚Äôs path!! Have been searching for a good set for quite some time and am happy I stumbled upon these.  I feel these containers are of a higher quality than others and the price is much more affordable.  I really like the fact that the lid handles are made up of durable plastic  The assortment of sizes is a plus, they‚Äôre easy to stack one on another and are rather durable. The locking mechanism works well to seal but not difficult like others I‚Äôve tried to open.  The Pen, chalkboard Labels & measuring spoon set are a great addition to the Set. Everything you might need for pantry organization has been provided.  The sizes of the containers are also just perfect for my needs.  I also really liked that the company includes a great note with your purchase and contacts you by email after purchase to check that you are happy  I feel like these are really going to hold up well over time and serve as great staple pieces in my pantry. I would definitely make this purchase again and am already thinking about ordering more to make my pantry even more streamlined and organized!"
"Absolutely love these containers! I am big on the smell of plastic and these areüëå. They have no smell, no after test of plastic, and are airtight-keeping everything fresh! Even the box they can in was very study and organized!! Highly recommend and will definitely order again!!"
"2020 Pandemic Pantry Project. I waited a while to write this review. I watched a video of one of the consumers and read all of the reviews but, not before looking at many other brands of storage containers. I started with the largest set. Did the water test. It's true, no leaks! I live in south Florida. I needed something that would work in this climate. Rest assured, these do!! I love puffcorn. They are like cheesepuffs but lighter. I put a bag in a container and, a week later, they were just as fresh as the day I originally put them in it. If you are considering these, DO NOT HESITATE!! You won't be sorry. OH, and the customer service is outstanding. Waleed, if you read this, thank you again for the complete new set that you sent to replace ONE piece that was broken during shipping. Amazing. I have purchased 5 different sets for my pantry needs and am over the moon. You even receive labels, a chalk marker and a set of measuring cups or spoons ,depending on the set you choose. I'm even considering purchasing more of the tall, slim pasta sets which come with a tool to help you measure the amount of pasta for different serving sizes. They really think of everything! Thank you again, Chefspath! 5 stars.  UPDATE: 16 Months later and this product still doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend the Chefs Path containers. I have since also purchased the new style Chefs Path pasta containers. They work as well as the original sets that I have purchased. The new style containers, for pasta, are long and the lids don't fit the original tall containers. The pasta containers do stack well which means you save even more space in your pantry. By far, the Chefs Path containers are the best purchase I have ever made through Amazon. If you live in a tropical climate and are considering these containers, don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed."
"Let‚Äôs start with the cons, there aren‚Äôt many: these aren‚Äôt worth $70, these are like snap fit containers. They leave large gaps between them wasting probably 1/4th of yourself space which you‚Äôll could fill with little things like seasoning envelopes but you will get a very cluttered look, alternatively if you‚Äôre physically impaired this may be a pro as it makes taking the thing off the shelf very easy and third they‚Äôre quite difficult to pull apart when you receive them to the point it has an instructional video, which I didn‚Äôt look at, but all the videos in the world won‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt have the hand strength to pull them apart - not good for the elderly or physically impaired. Otherwise I think they‚Äôre fabulous, they‚Äôre neat, clean, feel good in your hand, look nice, I like that you can put the label where you want so I placed mine if the side for my kids but where I don‚Äôt have to see them looking cluttered because I know what everything is. The tops seal easily and well and even with physical impairment or lack of hand strength would be relatively easy to open, none of mine were missing seals. Definitely worth a look if you want to drop $70 on some tall snap wear but the $50 price point is where it should be."
"I absolutely LOVE that all of the containers use the same size lid! No more searching for multiple sized lids! ***Waterbottle in the photo is for size reference. Not all the items are in the photo--I had already started to wash and dry. Order comes with 6 of each size, 24 containers and lids. Labels in the photo were a separate order from a different company. I did not use the chalkboard labels that came with this order.*** Durable and airtight and spill-proof too! I knocked some over before I transferred them all to the pantry...no breakage, no spillage. I totally already ordered a second set. Some of the smaller sizes would be perfect for bathroom/first aid storage. ***Note: make sure to let the lids dry COMPLETELY after washing. The channel with the rubber gasket around the lid can hold a little water so look out before sealing up your dry goods!"
"These are nice quality and can fit a wide array of food in them. My only complaint is the picture shown makes them appear to be clear plastic and while yes, they are, it‚Äôs not as clear as the photo. If that makes sense. It‚Äôs not clear bard plastic is has the whiteish appearance to it. They are fine, I‚Äôm just being picky. The quality is really wonderful and they work for what I needed."
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about not only these containers but the company and customer service too! The containers are great quality. The kids fit great and remain airtight. GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR. We looked at several containers online and thought these were the best value. We were a little worried about what we would get but figured we could return them if we didn‚Äôt like them. Boy, what a pleasant surprise! These containers are a good thickness and the sizes are perfect. We love them. MOST IMPORTANTLY, this company‚Äôs customer service is off the chart!! They say they pride themselves on their customer service and THEY MEAN IT! Once we ordered we received a message from the Co-Founder ensuring everything was good and we loved our containers. When we replied back with questions, he promptly replied, answered our questions. There was some confusion and I thought we didn‚Äôt get what we ordered because my wife ran off with containers right away. The Co-Founder went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction - both before and after I discovered there truly wasn‚Äôt a problem. This company‚Äôs home page of their website has a place to send them messages. No digging through pages or searching for contact information, their contact info is right there like they welcome your comments. Many companies could take a lesson in customer service from them. I highly recommend their products!"
"Organized my whole pantry with these! I bought three sets. I love them. I like that the marker is chalk so if you need to change the label just take a damp towel and it wipes off. Getting bigger ones for cereal and chips. The ones here don‚Äôt work great for that. Perfect for pasta, snacks, baking supplies (not flour or sugar, not big enough) and beans and rice."
I have been using them for a few weeks now and LOVE THEM!! They make my pantry and cupboards look so much better and they are so organized now. I have already ordered 2 more sets! When I received my order and one of the containers was broken. I emailed the company directly because that is what the letter that comes with the containers asks you to do. They were fantastic. It did take a couple of days for them to get back to me but they are a small business and I think it was within reason. They were super easy to work with and got me another set of containers right away. I promise you will be satisfied with your purchase.
I liked them however they do not hold a full bag of flour or a full bag of sugar
"I got the big set, when I unpackaged it, my heart sank at the thought of washing and drying all of these. I have a portable dishwasher and would've only been able to fit half and not the tall containers in at a time. So I handwashed them all which got rid of the plastic smell, and then hand dried them because I didn't have room to have them covering every inch of counter space for the next 4 days to dry. This involved 3 thick dish towels and several paper towels.  Finally it came time to fill them! I started with my baking cupboard - standard above the sink size with a shelf in the middle. Tall ones didn't fit standing up and BARELY FIT on their side (makes the cupboard door hang open about 1 mm). They are awkward on their side because of their odd tapered shape and bulky lids.  I've never liked the 4 snap lids but sometimes you make adjustments for organization's sake. Some sizing findings- I fit two bags of brown sugar in one tall container. I fit one jumbo and half a regular bag of chocolate chips in a second smallest container. A 3lb bag of sugar almost fit in a tall one. a standard box of corn starch that was 1/4 used barely fit in a small one. I transferred as much as I could from my baking cupboard, then moved on to my snack cupboard, and then miscellaneous cupboard. I had 5 containers of various sizes left over and that was after using 2 small ones without lids to organize some of my silicone stretch lids and reusable ziplock bags.  As expected, these were terrible to dry. Even after leaving out and then hand drying with a towel and then paper towel, water gets in/around/under the silicone ring in the lid no matter what. That's a major flaw and is going to create mold/mildew.  The shape works depending on your cabinet height and depth.  The stickers and marker work OK but the marker takes forever to dry and mine smudged easily unless I let it sit 5+ minutes before peeling up and applying.  PROS: Can only help organization. Secure and air tight. Comes with everything you need but no extra labels.  CONS: shape is odd, drying is a problem, moisture in the lids is a problem, they are not 100% recycled materials, and they come with an insane amount of plastic waste for packaging. Every single container is wrapped in plastic, the marker and measuring cups is wrapped in non-recyclable plastic, as is every individual sheet of labels! This is not necessary and counter-productive.  I got the big set, when I unpackaged it, my heart sank at the thought of washing and drying all of these.

This is not necessary and counter-productive.  Update 11/2020: unfortunately these aren't as airtight/moisture tight as I had first thought. My sugars and salt get hard/solid and clumpy. The lids come off if only one flap is loosened as well. I will still continue to use them but I won't be getting any more. I have 9 year old glass containers from ikea with no-clamp lids with silicon seals that keep dry goods 100% dry and were much cheaper."
"If I could give this a ZERO RATING I would!! I bought these because they had more good reviews than bad. I should have listened to the BAD reviewers! I finally got around to cleaning my pantry and was excited to use these. Unfortunately, These are ALL SMALL containers! SEE PHOTO OF PASTA IN CONTATINER! How am I supposed to get the lid on without breaking up the pasta? NOW I'M OUT $45 BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE RETURNED!!!!! They are hard to close and some won't close all the way and they smell!! I guess that's why they have a no return policy. I will do as my husband told me next time I order from Amazon,"" Make sure that you can return it before you purchase."" DON'T BUY THESE, YOU CAN GET SOME FROM THE DOLLAR STORE FOR LESS!!!!!"
"Bought these to store tall things in fridge door: celery, scallions, fennel, etc. Three of them fit in the racks just fine; can stack other containers on top. Used the fourth one for dried pasta in the pantry. Just what I was looking for!"
I love this set. I did a ton of research before deciding on this set. I was super excited about it. I was looking at their smaller set of 6 but then would need at least 2 packs. At that point it was only 2 dollars more to get the 28 piece vs 12. So I was super happy and impressed. When I got these one lid was broken but I contacted their support and they emailed me right away and said they would send a new one. Awesome customer service for sure. I love the set.
"We selected these containers for their design. The narrow design was important to us given we had narrow cabinets. They have the same sized lids which make it easier to find the right lid and makes these stackable.  The build quality appears very good. Flexible yet strong. I haven't used the labels and given the containers are transparent, not sure I will use them.  One of the containers came broken. It was shipped in the original product packaging without the standard Amazon box and bubble wrap. No surprise it broke.  I contacted the seller and sent the picture of the broken container. He promptly shipped a replacement box with seven containers. Great customer service."
"What I like about these particular containers is the fact that the lids lock and there are airtight. I can access my pasta easily and they fit nicely on my counter top. I used to store them in their original packaging and wrap them in plastic wrap to try and keep the weevils at bay but it didn‚Äôt work so well. Fed up with these buggies, I ordered a set of four back in June 2020, and loved them so much I placed another order for two more sets this month. November 2020. Which I split between my two kids and myself. I do add a couple of bay leaves to the pasta which also keeps the weevils at bay. Get it? Teehee ü§≠. They also come with pasta measuring sticks (which I‚Äôve never seen and never use but that‚Äôs cool too) and labels with writing marker. Definitely a keeper."
These containers are great. They have a rubber seal that can hold water after washing so look out for that before filling them but otherwise they are perfect for organizing all of the many dry ingredients I have in the pantry. I purchased two sets which is quite excessive for most pantries but any other fellow whole food plant based cooks will understand this need for excess
"When my first set came, I immediately ordered a second, then a third...and...the fourth one is arriving today. ü§£ I live that the length and width of each container is uniform-the same lid fits every single size!!! They lock super tight. I wasn‚Äôt planning to use the chalkboard labels and marker that come with, but once I started I couldn‚Äôt stop. Thrilled with the product and the excellent, responsive service from the company. Looking forward to more products from them!"
"Pests such a little moths have been a problem in the past and it is necessary to protect my food supply from them so I need something with a good seal and that will help to maximize my available shelf space. I like to keep enough dry food on hand as preparation for an emergency or a disaster and try to keep the supplies rotated. I ordered the 14-piece set which actually has 14 pieces not counting the lids. That sets this product apart from the beginning as most other companies count the lids as well as the container. True that there are a number of small containers but that's what I wanted. The small containers work in my plan to maximize available space. So does the square shape and the ability to stack them to fit the spaces neatly. The labels save a lot of time and look much neater than those I make myself. I live in an earthquake prone area, so these are appropriate for that reason as well. They are less likely to fall and much less likely to break than other containers. My set came with 2 broken tabs and missing the label kit. I emailed the customer support and got a prompt response. I was also hoping I could purchase extra lids in the future is more of them broke with long time use. The replacements came quickly as promised and I was surprised to get a generous additional supply as a bonus. That rarely happens, but that seems to be the way this company operates to earn all the 5-star reviews. I anticipate being a repeat customer and also will be giving some to friends to try out. Generosity begets generosity. It's also a good business policy."
"I love the clear containers and am SUPER happy with the four-way lid closures. I am packing for a major move and was worried about my pantry staples going bad or spilling. After a brief try out period and multiple home testing for seal security, I am happy to say I am no longer worried about the safety of my supplies.  I am very happly with the Chef's Path company. They were very friendly and eager to assure that I got what I was expecting and happy with their product. I give them a big thumbs up!!!"
"When these arrived I was instantly excited to get started on my pantry. I ready so many reviews on this brand before committing and I‚Äôm glad I did! The box and packaging was very nice, while getting the containers apart was a two person job (I have nerve issues and weakness in arms/hands), washing was a breeze. The seal comes out of the lids so you can really get all the crevices dried thoroughly. I then went to work trying to pick the lucky winners from the pantry that would get their new home inside these nifty containers. It took me an hour probably total to get everything done the way I wanted (I‚Äôm a little obsessive about organization), but once I was done these 14 containers helped me gain an entire shelf in my pantry! That night I wound up ordering two more sets and plan to order the $70 set eventually as well! I really love the airtight seals and the quality of these containers far exceeds what I expected for the price point. Obviously if you do the math buying the bigger sets gets you more bang for your buck but if you just need a few containers to finish off your collection these seriously are well worth the price! I saw some reviews complain about the shape and how it leaves unused space in their pantry. I honestly think the spacing is necessary and makes grabbing a single container out easy for any age from toddler chubby hands to grown man hands to my nerve damaged hands. And as I already mentioned, I gained an entire shelf just with these 14 containers. So I don‚Äôt find the shape to be a deterrent at all for me. I‚Äôm truly impressed by the quality, packaging, customer service, all of it! I‚Äôve already bragged to quite a few of my friends. If you‚Äôre on the fence because these aren‚Äôt a name brand, don‚Äôt be... you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"After ordering these, I was very pleased with their sturdiness, and the ability to really seal these containers, however, I would have preferred that they were not so tapered toward their base. These containers are super duper except that they are tapered too much at their base. They're a bit top heavy and fall over easily. Other than that one feature - I thought they were excellent, air-tight containers."

They fit the things I need very well. I held one of them under a bowl full of water and no water got in. The only thing I wish could be better are the rubber seals. It'd be better if they were thicker to make it even more airtight/waterproof and to make it easier to clean the lid completely. You need to use a toothpick to take out the rubber seal.
Misleading advertisement. Clearly quality is not as advertised. You can see that item received is not the same as pictured.
I feel that the container's are just as nice in person. The sizes are accurate. It is the beginning of organizing my pantry. All the tops are one size fit all so I don't have to worry about size. The tops snap on all four sides easily. They are dishwasher safe and easy to wipe clean if needed. I will get a smaller set after I see what more that I need. I also received a nice letter from the growing family business if I have any issues or concerns. I am glad to say that I am happy and excited. Good job Chefs Path!
"These food storage sets are amazing. I ordered both this Multi-size 14-piece set and the Large 4-piece set: - They're very well made. The plastic is thick and durable, very inflexible in comparison to cheaper plastic containers. - The lids seal perfectly to the containers without being difficult to snap open and shut. - The stacking is so satisfying! - I loved the packaging. The boxes both sets came in were sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, and very space conscious. - The ONLY downside to this was that the containers were packed tightly together and a little hard to separate, less so for the smaller ones. However, this is something the company must have been aware of because they included an insert with a site to visit for tips on separating the containers, and even though I didn't need it, the thoughtfulness was really nice. - That said, there was just a very personal feel to the whole package with the insert that introduces the company and makes it feel like Chef's Path genuinely cares about every customer. - The teaspoon and tablespoon measuring set, the labels, and the marker that was included with the set was a very nice touch. All in all, a fantastic product and an even more fantastic company! I'll be adding more containers to my collection in the future, and they'll be my go-to for any food storage needs in the long run."
"I was looking forward to using these containers for everything-- flour, tea, catnip, all sorts of stuff. When I opened the box and got to the lids, there was a weird, burning chemical smell.  I soaked them for hours and the smell is still there. I will admit that I deal with hypersensitivity to things like perfume and artificial flavors and dyes. This could be why I am noticing such a strong smell on the lids, so your individual experience may vary. My mother and husband also smell it, but not as strongly as I do.  Even if you're lucky enough to not notice a weird smell, it is obvious that there is something strange in the lid seal. I really don't want that tainting my dry goods. I will be returning these and looking for something less sketchy."
"When I ordered these, I never thought I'd be able to use them all, but I ordered them anyway, because of the good reviews and the price for the amount of containers being sold. I started dehydrating vegetables from my garden this year, instead of canning, so when I ordered these, they were to put dehydrated tomato slices in. As you can see in the picture, I decided this would work better for everything, so I can get what I need each time and not have to worry about vacuum sealing again each time. I'm using some to put candy bars and M&M's in (we'll pretend it's for when the grandkids come to visit) I didn't give any stars for freshness, because I just got them today, but I'll come back and update that once I can honestly answer it. As it says in the headline, I'm pleased so far. They are sturdy, they seal nicely, and since I don't have a dishwasher, they, like everything else, they are a pain in the, you know, that thing, to clean, but this is no fault of the manufacturer. I wonder if they could send me a good woman? We could switch off every other day washing dishes. If she'd help pull weeds in the garden, that would be a bonus."
"I received the chefs path storage dry food containers, I love the sturdy packing, they came in and when I opened the box they were thick sturdy plastic and lids. I am very very very pleased. I really like the labels and marker they provide, so I can organize my pantry with these wonderful labels. I would highly recommend. Don't go to big lots, homestore places like come to this company. They were quick and the product look just like the picture. I am very well satisfied customer üëç. Mrs. James"
"I loooooove these containers, they make my pantry look super neat and organized!! I bought these tall containers plus two boxes of the smaller ones. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G quality and seal. I used these to store snacks and baking supplies and they definitely keep the freshness of the product. I also love that you could use them in the fridge! I put my blueberries/blackberries/strawberries in the smaller containers. Keeps my refrigerator organized.  One of the containers had a little dent on them and the customer service went above and beyond! A+ from beginning to the end. They sent me a new box without hassle. Super please w/ this product and the customer service provided! Will definitely be buying more in the future, I‚Äôm addicted to organizing my kitchen stuffüòÇ"
"Have others like this and love them. But I received these today and one is cracked. Can‚Äôt find a like to complain so I‚Äôm posting here hoping for a replacement. I do like these and don‚Äôt want to return all of them because of one being cracked, but would like it made good. Update and changed to 5 stars. The company contacted me and replaced the cracked one, they actually sent an entire set and wanted nothing returned. They were prompt to reply and I absolutely love the containers. Highly recommend them and the company."
"I love these containers. If you‚Äôre trying to organize your pantry these are a must! I have different containers from other brands. The other brand is clear, hard plastic whereas these are not ‚Äúas see through‚Äù if that makes sense. The problem with the other brand is that the plastic cracks very easily where as these are much more durable. I like the fact that it comes with many different sizes the smaller size can be used as Tupperware for leftovers. The labels and markers work well. I find that to erase the marker to write something new, windex works well. Just spray a little drop and rub it in with your finger then wipe. The containers have a good seal to keep food fresh. The best part though, is the customer service. In my original order one of the lids arrived broken. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement lid. Instead of sending me a lid or 2, they ended up sending me a whole other set! That is very sweet of them to do! As a small business owner myself, I really appreciate that type of customer care because I always go above and beyond for my clients, so it‚Äôs great to see other companies do that as well. I also liked the set of measuring spoons that came with it. They are colorful and whymsical. Since I already have 2 sets that I use for cooking/baking I put these in the containers with the appropriate serving for that item, this way it‚Äôs always in there and ready for me to use. For ex. I put the spoons in my maca, lions mane, ashwagandha, spirulina and all the things I use for my smoothies. So that worked out great."
"This is a top notch company that stands behind its product. I highly recommend purchasing and doing continued business with Chefs Path. They stand firmly behind their products and respond incredibly fast to concerns or questions. I say this because I had the pleasure of experiencing this great service first hand. It's time to support family businesses instead of the big box stores. This is truly a family business that deserves to stay afloat during these tough times. Their product is fantastic and their customer support is stupendous and genuine, they really do care! Support them and purchase their fabulous products, dont hesitate, this is the best!"
"Good quality with great style. These were just as I expected and they work perfectly in the intended space. I was actually surprised that I was able to use them all so quickly as I thought I couldn‚Äôt possibly have enough to fill them all, but I did! I love that they are stackable and I love the chalkboard stickers with the included pen. You can easily wet erase, dry, and label again. These containers, though pricey, are actually economical comparatively. A popular brand container of the same size as the largest in this set runs for $18. Yes, they are clear and have special closing mechanism but if you are on a budget as I am, the Chef‚Äôs Path are far worth it in comparison. Some things to note, these are not perfectly clear plastic, they are slightly opaque which I was aware of when I made my purchase but once filled they look great and it doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least. I love that they are decorative since they are on exposed shelving in my kitchen. I‚Äôm going to add some baskets on my lowest shelf to complete the look. I would recommend!"
"Honestly I just barely got these, and I'm really excited. I am not a tidy person, not because I don't care but because I have a hard time organizing large spaces. I find containers to be immensely helpful. Every time I find something I can containerize, my world gets more organized. That's one of the reasons I'm excited for these containers.  They're not hard to get apart. All you have to do is hold the top one, and pull gently on the ones on the bottom. Don't try to remove the bottom one first. If you hold on to the top, and gently pull on it once on the bottom, gravity will do it's thing. It might take a few seconds, but it's actually kind of fun to do.  We have a big problem with rodents in this house. They got in over the winter, and we're really having a rough time with them. My brother's goal is to poison them, my goal is to bore them to death. I'm very excited that I can put any open food in a container that mice will not be able to get into easily. I mean I could have a really wanted to, but it would be much easier to go find something else to eat. I am extremely excited about these. As I go on, I'll come back and tell you what other cool things I found out about him.  The picture that you can't identify, is the needles for insulin pens. I have had a really big problem with losing the Box they come in. This way the Box stays put, I can find my needles, they don't end up on the ground, and I have a clear view of how many I have left. Freaking awesome!!!"
"I purchased the set of 24 containers and I couldn‚Äôt love it more. The sizes are great for all of your storage needs. They are very affordable compared to other storage systems and the quality of the product is excellent. I cleaned my pantry and I find myself opening the door just to look at how organized it is. No more misc. bags or boxes everywhere. Everything is neatly stored in clear containers with locking lids and write on labels. They are super easy to wash by hand or just throw in the dishwasher. Although, I found the tallest ones would not fit in my dishwasher. The customer service at this company is amazing. I will probably buy another set soon."
"I ordered these to organize my pantry and keep things fresh with the airtight feature. The product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well. Since the container are nested inside each other, I thought it was going to be difficult to separate them but there was instructions provided in the box with a link to a video to show how to easily separate the containers. That was very helpful!  I washed the containers before using them and noticed that water was trapped under the rubber seal. This was an easy fix as I just removed the black, rubber seal and allowed to air dry. The rubber seal is easy to both remove and replace.  The containers are the thickness of Rubbermaid and Tupperware storage products and they stack very well and are easy to open and close. The various sizes make it easy to store a wide variety of foods. The black, rubber seal helps lock in food freshness and is just the right thickness.  Very happy with these! Highly recommended!!!"
"Wow, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set. I really wish I could afford to pick up more right now, they are perfect!!! I didn't find them small at all, the reason the box that comes in the mail is smaller in size than some might expect is because they package them perfectly inside each other. They can be a bit tough to get out of the packaging because they are packed tightly, (they do included a card with a link to show best way to get them apart), but once you get them out you have the perfect set!!! They're sturdy, this, airtight, clean lines, washed nicely in the dishwasher. They come with labels and a chalk marker, easy to use. Mine are neatly put away inside my pantry but look great out and viewable as well. I want them in every size/shape they come in so I could do the whole pantry!!! I'm in love with this set. I even suggested it to my daughter who bought a slightly different set from the same company, for her apartment and LOVES THEM TOO, they have many different sizes too meet just about any need to might have. I used mine for three different kinds of pasta the spaghetti in the tallest, I also have egg noodles an elbow macaroni in the two step down sizes. I also used it for candy/snacks for my son who has special needs, he will now be able to get his own instead of struggling with a bag to open all the time. Very happy with my purchase and the sizes I received, as the measurements given in pics and description were spot on. I'm hoping to get the two large container set that my daughter got for my flour and sugar."
"I recently tried these containers....and I understand all the rage! I appreciated the description that stated their sizes, which allowed my to decide what could be stored in them and the amounts. Although they are not clear containers as they are advertised - which is more aesthetically pleasing - they are clear enough to easily see what is in them. The plastic seems durable and the lids seem to seal pretty good. I also appreciated the packaging, which had soft dividers between each container - allowing them to come apart smoothly and hassle free. The set is for average sized items (as opposed to the larger 'family' sized boxes or bags of food) so they are intended for typical proportions. Lastly, the nice, multi-shaped label stickers and colorful measuring spoons were lovely additions of detail that was not overlooked and was much appreciated. Time and usage will ultimately determine how good these containers are but so far I really like them."

"I scour the reviews before buying products and was pretty convinced these would be what I wanted. They're excellent. Strong plastic, airtight seals, and easy to open and close (i.e. you don't have to make sure the ""tabs"" line up on each side when you're pushing them down). Also, I think it's great that they come WITH the ""chalkboard"" labels and the white pen. Nice bonus! It got two of my kitchen cabinets cleaned up & organized in a very short time. I'm definitely planning to buy more. Also was impressed with the immediate attention from the company. Way to go, Chef's Path!"
"I am an organization snob‚Ä¶ Meaning everything needs to be in its place and everything needs to have a place. I have a very small pantry with a very deep shelves and was getting tired of rummaging through things to find anything let alone having to reach all the way back to get some thing I needed. I love the way but these sizes work well with each other. The tall ones go on the back the next size down goes in front of those and so on. If you put the labels right underneath the clip where the lid is you‚Äôll be able to see everything. And the price for this set couldn‚Äôt be any better. Some of you may say that $70 is a lot for plastic bins‚Ä¶ But if you go and look at other individual bins from other sellers you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre going to pay $10-$12 for one bin. If you do the math you‚Äôre actually only paying a little under $3.00 per container. They are a good quality material, they seal well so food will stay fresh and they are very easy to clean. I have already ordered the set of 4 cereal bins and have a few more of their items in my wish list cart. Chef‚Äôs Path is the reason my pantry will finally be organized they way I‚Äôve always wanted it to be."
"These. Containers. Are. Awesome! I would've never bought these before, but we rehabbed our kitchen and we now have a large pantry in the kitchen. So I wanted it to look nice and organized and thought, what the heck I'll try it. I don't know why I never used things like this before. It is so organized and clean and everything fits together in the pantry drawer. The containers themselves are very sturdy. After I washed them, there was no evidence of any kind of plastic smell, still haven't noticed that after weeks in my pantry. The lids are fairly easy to navigate. I have RA and my hands can hurt a lot from time to time, but these lids are not difficult to open at all. Highly recommend!"

"I bought these a few months ago to help organize my pantry better. I live out in Indiana and am surrounded by fields. Certain times of the year are known for mice trying to get in your house. I have had problems with them getting in my pantry and destroying food. This allows me to have an organized pantry and to keep my food safe. I have dropped them by accident on the laminate floor(not often) and they have held up well. The labels are fantastic so I know exactly what is in there. It is easy for anyone looking in my pantry to easily find something. The tall ones have been great for spaghetti, lasagna, manicotti, and even cereal. I used to have the tall Rubbermaid containers, but those took up a lot of space. These hold a lot and don't take up near as much room. I can easily put several side by side. I also purchased the next size down because I loved these so much. If you are looking to organize your pantry and need something functional and reasonably priced, I would definitely suggest these."
I got my containers and love them. I noticed I was missing one of the smaller container from the set and contacted the seller via email and explained. They were quick to resolve it and said they were sending out one to me. To my surprise it was a whole new set of the containers. Was not expecting that and emailed back thank you and was only expecting just the missing container but they insisted on 100% customer satisfaction which I was and more so. Great product and does as it says and great customer service!
*BUYER BEWARE * NOTHING. LIKE. THE. PICTURE.  If you‚Äôre looking to make your pantry aesthetically pleasing and think you‚Äôll be receiving a product that looks like the picture‚Äî DO NOT PURCHASE!!! These are just regular Tupperware- they are not clear like in the picture!!!!!!!
"I have been busy mom and not able to shop in stores, which is why I ended up with these. Cheap trick and shame on amazon for letting customers be fooled. Some day amazon will also doom for such tricks. To dear buyers, Buy them only if you are ok for below flaws. 1)In ad photos they show clear plastic boxes, in real we get regular plastic. Plz see my photos. 2) Quality is cheap 3)All given dimensions are messed up. Much smaller in real. 4) Non refundable 5)Smells like chemical I know we all need to make money to live so I am just giving bad review and make peace with the boxes and use them. Next time I will get from my dear Costco where I can return even after a year...but tbh, who would return good quality."
"EDIT/UPDATE I originally gave 3 stars for receiving broken containers and had just emailed the customer service and was too impatient to wait for a response..... but, since getting ahold of them, and they responded quickly and corrected the issue with no problem!!!!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING!!!!!  ORIGINAL: I was so excited when i got these!!!! but as i went through and washed them and started to fill them i got down to the last couple stacks of the containers and a few were broke. which is very unfortunate because I really need to use all I can. was considering buying another pack until i ran into this issue. If they are broke from shipping, will they last through daily use of opening and closing? i would hate for them to start to break after use also. unfortunately I may send the whole thing back and try again else where."
"I have been hoping to bring some order to my pantry for awhile and have always loved the idea of most everything in clear consistent containers. These made the transition cost effective and convenient. I love the sizes, and the seal from the lids is secure. They stack well and look nice. I also didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôd be more convenient when I actually need to measure ingredients because of the wide rigid openings - it‚Äôs really easy to get spoons and measuring utensils in and out and leveled off, or to control how fast/slow contents pour out compared to many items‚Äô original packaging. I know that sounds silly and it‚Äôs not a huge thing but I‚Äôve been surprised by how often I‚Äôve appreciated that unexpected benefit in the last week since I‚Äôve been using them. The seller‚Äôs customer service is also awesome. I had one container that was broken when it arrived, and the seller was easy to work with and quick to work out a replacement option for me. I would definitely recommend."
"1/18/21 - Upon contacting the seller, we were made whole in a very timely manner. Customer Service was great and we'd order again from this seller.  We received this item and all of the containers and lids were accounted for. There were no broken lids as others have mentioned. However, there were no labels or marker which was one of the main draws to this particular item. We have other measuring spoons so that's not a big deal but the concern comes into play when something is supposed to be included but isn't. We contacted the firm directly to request replacements of the missing pieces but have not received a response. We don't recommend this item based upon the lack of items and response."
"While I love OXO storage containers, they can get pricey when you need a handful of them. I found these on a deal and took a chance .  These storage containers are truly airtight. I put pretzels that were already opened in one over three weeks ago and they aren't stale at all. This was my number one must.y containers had to actually keep dry goods fresh. These do the job very well.  The tops secure shut by the four heavy duty tabs. They are sometimes tough to open so if that's important to you these may not be for you. I have found that they seem to have gotten easier to open since I have been using them. Hopefully it's because they needed to be worked a bit and not because the seal fails slowly. I've had them for 5 weeks and so far so good. I'll update in a few months.  They are thick and seem really durable. My son dropped two already and they were fine. For the price and amount you get combined with the quality I am really very happy with this purchase and would definitely repurchase."
"I needed something to corral all my pasta, cereal, baking supplies, etc. I have a set of another brand that I use on my flour, sugar, etc, for baking. Their biggest containers barely held 5 lbs of flour, and then if you smooshed/shook in the last couple of cups. I had no problem getting reasonable quantities into this set. For my larger stash of dry goods (rice, pasta, flour, bulk baking mixes etc) I purchased their other containers which will hold gobs more. Their XXL size holds a gallon & a half each. More than enough for rice, flours, sugar, beans, etc. Or even the jumbo bagged cereals. Their XL size holds a just over a gallon as well. The bodies and lids are translucent, not crystal clear as some have complained, but you can still see the volume of your product. The lids come in only a few sizes so that you can leave search for that 1 lid that only fits that container, in the dust.  I had one container that arrived broken and I contacted the sell with a picture and the order number. They quickly and efficiently credited to my account the cost of the single container. (I figure I will slap some packing tape over the cracked portion, and use it to hold office supplies.) I purchased a total of 4 sets of the 24, 4 sets of the XL, and 4 sets of the jumbo XXL, and their flatter noodle pack that holds spaghetti, lasagna, or linguine noodles easily.  I would highly recommend Chef's Path's products to anyone trying to simplify and organize their kitchen. The free labels & measuring cups/spoons are a nice addition."
"My pantry was a jumble of bags tossed all over each other and was a pain to find anything. These are exactly what I needed to organize everything. They're a great size, very tight seal around the lid yet easy to open/close because of the style of the lids. One of the containers arrived broken, so I messaged the seller and they sent me an entirely new set the same day. I couldn't be happier!"
"Pros: Overall, this set of panty containers is great. Easy to clean, easy to fill and pour, and the lids fit and snap perfect. Love that all the lids are the same size. I cannot speak to the longevity or freshness of products long term as I just received. But they feel like quality made products. The chalk labels are an added bonus and adds to the cohesive look. Cons: two containers arrived broken. See photos. The plastic appears to be cracked from shipping and the broken plastic was at the bottom of the box. This gives me concern about longevity of the plastic. However, there was no padding in the shipping box, so this could be a shipping fault and no fault on the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the damaged tops do not allow the lids to fit properly or latch. I am waiting to hear back from the company as to a fix for this issue as these were not inexpensive containers. Also, it seems that with washing the lids, water collects along the seam with the seal. Hopefully this does not affect the seal or the product stored in the container."
"Used these and ""can steps"" (spice shelf) to organize my pantry last weekend. Even the small size holds a nice amount. Love the black customizable labels and chalk pen. A reminder - when washing for the first time, make sure you take out the rubber gasket in the top or moisture will get caught in there. Dry well and replace the gasket. Fabulous value for a great look and clean lines in the pantry. Like that they are clear and not opaque like some others I found here on Amazon. Even though they have labels, it's nice to see how much product you have with just a quick look!"
"** Update: I was contacted by the seller a few days after emailing them. They‚Äôre sending me a replacement lid and the customer service rep was very helpful. I would recommend this product based on their customer service alone. **  I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to open up all the containers yet but so far the second bunch I opened one of the lids came damaged. I contacted the seller the other day and haven‚Äôt heard from them yet so I‚Äôll update when/if they respond.  These containers are nice, I bought them on a sale and wouldn‚Äôt have paid full price for them just because I feel like it‚Äôs kind of pricey for plastic. The lids do end up taking more space than expected since you can‚Äôt line up the containers flush together. The sizes are decent for what I need them for but I wouldn‚Äôt get them if you buy a lot of bulk items unless you‚Äôre okay with using multiple containers for one type of item.  Although there are some issues, they are easy to clean and the seal does come out of the lid easily if you have long nails or a toothpick. I would make sure the lid was 100% dry before using or you might catch unwanted moisture between the lid and the seal."
"This was exactly what I needed to finally get my cupboards organized. It was impossible to find anything in the messy pile of opened, half used, bags and boxes of food. Now I can see and get to everything in my cupboard. In the future, I will probably only the two middle sizes, since those were the ones I really needed more than the others. I also ordered some of the really big containers for my bulk stuff.  Pros: These really are airtight. They are easy to clean because the little gasket that makes them airtight comes out of the lid for washing and drying. The lids are universal, which is convenient. It comes with the labels and markers. The labels are sturdy and reusable, just wipe the marker off with a damp cloth. One set of these was almost enough to reorganize all my cupboards.  Cons: The tall containers are really tall. I had to readjust the shelves in my cupboard. I wish these were as deep as the cabinets, but instead I have them in the cupboard two-deep."
"First, these are great quality. Sturdy, airtight and easy to use at a good price. My 3 star rating is because it is difficult to know the size of these containers. I had wanted to use these on a 12‚Äù shelf in my pantry and these are jus a smidge (1/2‚Äù too tall. I never saw a height for these on the sight- only the package dimensions and the volume they contain. I assumed they would be about as tall as the spaghetti. That leaves about 2‚Äù above the spaghetti & more room for the spaghetti to shift around. I‚Äôd love to order more from this company but the size of containers is important to maximize the space in my cupboard."
"I rarely write reviews as there tends to be many others already there and mine would just get lost in the pile but after receiving my storage containers I was very happy and pleased with the product that I am taking the time to write. I will admit, I was most attracted to the quantity of containers for the great price. I just assumed they were going to be thin and cheap but I wasn't looking for anything heavy duty that would get constant daily use so I wasn't too concerned. When I received the shipment, there was a very good looking sturdy designed box that had safety seal stickers which indicated if the package was ever opened, so I know I was not getting a returned item. The carton instantly made the product look like I was getting quality. The effort and expense to package plastic containers this well wasn't necessary. Upon opening the box, all the containers were stacked and while a little difficult to separate, each were wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent any scratches. The capacity of each container worked out almost exactly to match the boxes of pasta I was putting them in there so I was able to save a lot of room in my cabinet stacking the containers. The lids closed tight and the snap seemed strong and secure, like it will not break off after a few times of flexing it. There was a bonus in there too with label stickers, marking pen and measuring spoons, coupons for future orders and a nice note from the family owners of the business. Overall I very pleased with my purchase and would definitely buy the same brand again when I need more. I highly recommend these containers for the great quality and price. I was a great deal!"
"I purchased these containers and was a little leary about how they'd look and whether or not they'd be enough to contain everything that I needed to put in them in my pantry. Yesterday I sorted through most of my pantry and I was SO happy that these containers worked out perfectly! They're dishwasher safe, which is great. After I was sure they were thoroughly dry, I put my dry goods (cereal, crackers etc) in them and organized the top of my pantry. It not only held everything I needed it to, I have plenty of containers left over to work on the rest of my pantry and/or fridge. They look great, they're very easy to use, and they seem air tight. I love the little chalkboard labels and white pen that they come with. Super easy to use and it looks really cute. I read some of the reviews that said they have an odor, but they don't. They aren't clear per se, but they're ""frosted"" so although you can see through them, they're not perfectly clear, which is ok with me. Shipping was super fast and everything came in intact, nothing broken or missing. There was a nice note from the sellers also, guaranteeing 100% satisfaction. I would definitely order from this company again and would order these containers again. I highly recommend them if you're an organizer like me."
"I never have the time to write reviews but I had to write one for this because this product has made me soooo happy!!! I wish I took a before photo but let‚Äôs just day it was a mess in my pantry. I have a tiny pantry and just piled everything in there. Making it hard for me to find things and worst of all, forgetting things I had already bough to the point they‚Äôd gone bad and I didn‚Äôt even realize until I decided to do this overhaul.  This activity was actually fun. My four year old daughter helped me transfer boxes and packets into these storage containers (Full disclosure I had been using the cereal containers from a different company for some time already).  The snapping kids are great and easy for even my four year old to operate. I love that the labels can be rewritten depending on what you buy next. Just wipe with a little water and it‚Äôs good as new and ready for whatever new product is inside.  This has transformed my pantry and I can clearly see what I have and what I‚Äôm running low on. Dramatically changed my pantry and it is a must for tiny pantry‚Äôs like mine.  I recommend getting this large set as it was perfect for almost everything in my pantry. This is the best investment to start your pantry storage then if you need more you can buy the smaller sets. But if you start with those you‚Äôll likely need more and could wind up spending more as you try to piece it together.  I also got a can rack from another company and the door rack was previously installed by the last homeowner so I used that to put my bottles and sauce packets. This pairs well with wire shelf liners too for a seamless and solid foundation. You guys have a customer for life in me. Thank you!!!"
"I gave this product three stars because I was super disappointed to receive one of the tallest containers broken. These long ones were the very reason that I purchased the set and now I have to throw one away. They were also smaller than they looked in the photos. On the positive side, I can definitely find good use for these storage containers. I especiallylike the airtight covers. I just hate the fact that I lost one of my favorite ones. Wish I could get it replaced but I live in Trinidad. It will cost me more to send it back!  Update I have to raise the stars on my review of this product. I reached out to the seller via email with pictures of the damages to the containers received. I was pleasantly surprised to hear back within hours from the seller who resent an entire set for me. The set is in great condition and I could not be more pleased with their service. They really do care about their customers. Thank you so much for resolving this matter!"
"I have had these circular, pink canisters since I graduated from college in 1994. They've been fine except that they aren't air tight. Being almost fifty (GASP), I figured it was time to up my food storeage game. I saw these and decided to take a chance. They're great; certainly air tight feature since the snapping takes a few tries to line it up and get it right. The look more sleek on my rolling pantry and certainly more grown up. I'm certainly happy with my purchase and I will probably order other sizes individually (If I can) moving foward to store other items that come in cardboard containers. #YouWontRegretIt"
"I‚Äôve bought from this company before and I‚Äôve had only great luck with them. Several of the really negative reviews said they were all the same size, but as you can see, mine are exactly as advertised with the four sizes. I‚Äôve bought their other variety which I really love that are air tight, and are made of clear, hard plastic and a totally different air tight lid, which I kind of like better. And while they‚Äôre expensive, compare them to Tupperware and they‚Äôre inexpensive. Tupperware used to be the only decent airtight storage, but they‚Äôre truly unaffordable, and they‚Äôre not even rated in the top 10. This storage company is rated at the top for air tightness, which is why I buy these in the first place ...to keep flour and perishables from getting destroyed."
I needed air tight containers to store my dry goods and these fit the bill. Great four sided lock lids def keep everything air tight which is what I needed. The shipping was quick and they all arrived Un-damaged as they were very well packed. I appreciate that the lids are universal and each lid fits all of the sizes- so no hunting for the right size lid. I also like the reusable chalk pen and labels. It allows me to put the product expiration date on each one so I know how fresh it is. Having the dry goods stored this way also helps me see what we already have in stock - we were sadly buying what we already had so this makes it easy to see what we have and what we need. These are very sturdy and great quality and really are air tight. The fact that they are stackable is a huge plus for saving storage space.
"These are comparable to the lock and lock storage containers. The largest size, in my opinion are not large enough for flour, cornmeal, or cereal, but they are large enough for rice, dried beans, pasta, etc. This set is not for warehouse club shoppers. But, if you buy normal sized packages from the grocery store this set will accommodate most items and for the number of containers you get, the price isn‚Äôt bad. The quality appears to be good, the lids are interchangeable, and the depth is exactly the same which makes for a great presentation as well as good functionality. I would buy this set again, even with the $70 price tag."
"(Quick disclaimer: The labels used in the photo are not the labels included with the containers. I had ordered them without realizing the set came with its own and, because I had already used them for other organizers in my home I decided to use them for these as well. The labels included fit the size of these containers much better) okay now that‚Äôs over, I love these. My partner complained that he doesn‚Äôt like the taper at the end bc it feels like wasting space when they don‚Äôt fit perfectly. I disagree, primarily due to the height of the shelf I put cereal on. I like being able to get my fingers between them at the bottom to slide them out. I don‚Äôt wanna reach all the way to the top so I can tip it towards me. To each their own, but I think they‚Äôre pretty perfect, the seal hasn‚Äôt failed me yet and aesthetically I love not having so many boxes turned every which way so I can‚Äôt see the labels. It‚Äôs great. If I ever need more I‚Äôll probably get more of the same set."
They‚Äôre not acrylic clear but plastic clear. I liked them because of the large size. It fits 5lb sugar and flour bag. I really like them!
"I love them. Yeh, yeh, I've only had them for a day- but they are great and I'm getting more!  They are HARD to separate, but if you can get it between your knees and pull straight out, it works. Having a friend (or willing teenager) also helps.  It also come with little scoops and stickers and a chalk pen. (: I think it's a great deal."
Perfect solution to keep the animals out! They have managed to open and get into everything I've tried so far. They fit a 6lb bag of food perfectly and the measuring cups are great for portioning. In the picture you can see that they are pretty big containers. Tallulah is a full grown kitty and she was able to use them as a bed once she gave up on getting into them!
"These are awesome! We acquired these in an attempt to build an emergency pantry. They were very well boxed, had labels, a pen for the labels, and a beautiful set of measuring cups. I will be expanding my pantry of these types of containers and thank you for offering such an AMAZING PRODUCT"
"Easily holds 10 lbs of sugar, not as much flour. tight seal"
"These containersxare the best, air tight containers I've ever used. No, they are not clear as shown in the picture but you can certainly see what's in the container. Bought the 3 medium ones and went back to get the 2 big ones."
I use these in my pantry. Love they are square and fit together nice side by side with little wasted space. I am able to stack them 2 high also.
I haven't had this product long but it seems to work well. I am not sure how the taller containers will work in my new kitchen but I like everything sealed.
Difficult to separate until I put them in the refrigerator for 10 minutes then took them out turned upside down on the floor and held the bottom one with my feet and pulled on the top one then they separated. After that they are fine and I love them
Very pleased with these items. Sturdy & seals well. Great quality product.
"Love the locking, durable, airtight storage ability. Used mine for baking essentials. I need more!"
"I used it to store cereal and flour. I will buy more of this storage container as the need arises. The shape fits in the cupboard and shelves to allow other items to fit next to it, wasting no space. No complaints wirh this product."
Love them great value for the money!
Needed taller storage to match the other storage containers that I have. Able to store pancake mix from Costco without any problems
I was hesitant to purchase but they are a heavy duty plastic with a tight fitting lid. I will be buying more.
Very sturdy n definitely air tight
Like very much came with label great
use it for my sugar and flour and it does the job
As described. Perfect for my white & brown sugars.
Use product in bathroom and kitchen. Leaves nice scent. I like that it's bleach free and works just as well.
"The lids aren't the easiest to put on, but it is a good product. I would buy it again."
"I needed these so badly for protecting my food from varments. They were extremely hard to separate. I thought I would have to call Hercules to get them apart. I struggled for hours. Finally, put them between my knees and just kept pulling, and finally came apart. It was extremely difficult. Thought I would have to go to Planet Fitness to get some strong men to get them separated. Then............put the food in and put the top on and they won't latch. I practically had to sit on them to get them down far enough to latch. Finally, success, but as soon as I got two sides latched, the other ones popped open. Fought with these for a couple of days and still won't latch or stay latched. On day three, I'll try again, but I know it is futile. My advice, don't buy these. Nothing should be that difficult to use. Wish I had read the reviews first before I bought them."
"Perfect, The containers are great, lids, size, and the labels with pen and I love the measure cups . Well worth the money. Very Very Happy"
Nice size. difficult to separate and can‚Äôt get the covers to click on. worthless without that happening.
The size of the container was exactly what I was looking for but oh boy you need muscles to close the lid. I kept it because it wasn‚Äôt too expensive but I won‚Äôt be buying more I will check other vendors.
"I've never left a bad review in my life, but I am trying to help you out, but these are terrible quality. NOT ABLE TO RETURN because it says you can't return flammable liquids or gases???? so you're just stuck with a crappy product. So, so hard to close. Most of the time I physically cannot get all of the sides to latch. Saving the little bit of money because these are cheaper isn't worth it."
"Haven't used long enough to know if they are airtight and leak proof. They seem to work well enough. We thought we weren't going to be able to separate them. Turns out if you take out the plastic between them, they pull apart."
Storage containers are very hard to clip shut. With a lot of force it is possible but it is not convenient to do so for every day use. These could be used to store items not accessed often. The other issue is that they are not returnable because of fire hazard or gasses. If that is the case do you really think it is wise to store food in them???? Very disappointed. I will end up throwing them away.
The lids take an extreme amount of finesse to figure out how to close properly. I broke one right off trying to apply pressure to get them to latch. I would have absolutely returned these if it was possible.
On one of the containers the second time I open and re-close the top the latch on one side broke off therefore the lids only held on by three sides for the price I could‚Äôve went to the dollar store and got a better product. Save your money !!!!!
So far these seem to be OK but I did have trouble with the seals on both but only time will tell if it's a really good buy or not
"These look nice, but the lids will not close. They won't snap on. I did get the 2 pack and NEITHER lid will close. I have several similar containers that close this way, but these simply will not snap on. AND YOU CAN NOT RETURN THEM, so just out the cost."
"Not nearly as big as what I needed. Nothing wrong with them, just not big enough."
"Was told you can't return because they contain flammable liquid or gasses. They are too big for me to pick up, so I'd like my money back. ...."
The airtight lids are difficult to seal and are prone to opening on their own. Pass this one up.
Don't understand why Amazon this this storage container is a flammable gas and won't accept this to return. Someone at Amazon needs glasses! Now I'm stuck with a product I don't want because it doesn't suit my needs! So unhappy!
Don't waste your money. The little hinge closure on the side keeps popping open!
The snap tabs DON‚ÄôT snap close.
Very hard to close the lids. I did not noticed it was not returnable. I wouldn‚Äùt keep it. This brand is not a good quality.
"These are poorly made. They are not easy to close and even harder to open. Worst part, NON REFUNDABLE!!! BUMMER!"
This are useless. The lids will not latch. Total waste of money.
Ordered this product to store wheat flour but the lid doesn't snap on all four sides. There is no return policy hence we are stuck with this product without any use.
The lids wont lock. Tried to return but product cannot be returned
"Very flimsy and the lids don't even fit on, so you can store any food. Even worse, they can't be returned. This product is worthless"
This product was impossible to use as one container was jammed inside the other container and impossible to separate.
"The lids are so hard to get on and close them that I actually broke one of the flip down locks and now I can't return them. Ugh! I thought these were going to be great, but I have arthritis in my hands and they are so hard to open and close. Not worth it."
The lids would not seal........tried everything to seal the covers (lids)......
Lids don't fit. Sent order back. New one came. Same problem
Worthless and cannot be returned. Cannot separate the containers without breaking!
I didn‚Äôt like the lids because they‚Äôre very hard to put on üò°
One of the lids provided was defective/torn. The seller was not responsive to correct the situation. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
It came in damaged and I‚Äôm seeing that it can‚Äôt be returned or replace!
Product arrived and lids will not fit correctly. Product appears to be warped. Disappointed.
I can't get the 2 containers apart
"Look at the size of this container. One is currently holding flour (it holds a 10-lb bag!), and the other is holding sugar. For comparison, but jar to its left is a gallon jar! These containers are huge! The set of two comes at a great price, with airtight snap lids, and is transparent enough that you can see what is inside. The plastic cleaned easily and dried without streaking (the first thing I always do is wash an item). Wow! These are versatile enough that they could be used for something other than food storage, but that was what I got them for. They arrived quickly and safely. I am very, very pleased with them. If you need a big (6.5 liters) storage container, but not a gigantic one, give these a try. You will not be disappointed. They also came with three pages of lovely blackboard-looking labels, and a white ""chalk"" pen. A free gift of a set of measuring cups was included, which was really nice. The measuring cups are oval, so they fit into smaller containers much better than round measuring cups. Also, they are fairly thin plastic and lightweight. I just bought a set that are heavy and clunky--I like the set that came with these containers much better, and they were a free gift! Give the containers a try. You will be glad that you have them!"
"These are some really great size airtight storage containers !  Here‚Äôs my list to simplify everything down !  Positives :  - Set of 2 huge BPA Free Clear Plastic storage containers !  - Set includes 1 multi colored measuring spoon set, 3 sticky labels sheets and 1 chalk marker !  - Airtight leak proof 4 side locking lids seal firmly !  - Hold a 10 pound rice/sugar conveniently !  - Easy to identify what‚Äôs inside without opening the container because it‚Äôs see through ; also the label looks great as well !  - BPA Free ; food safe material !  - Shatter-resistant plastic !  - Space saver : stackable !  - Convenient to wash !  - Suitable for refrigerator !  - Gift-able !  Negatives :  - Lids are hard to put on or off initially ; it takes a bit of muscle power to open or close the lids !  Final thoughts :  - These are some really good size clear plastic storage containers for storing various items. The only exception is that the lids are not as smooth to open or close which could be challenging for some like people with arthritis !"
"I just needed a large waterproof container to house my dishwasher tablets and I found these. The size is perfect because there's over 100 cleaning tablets in one and there's still room. While the plastic container itself is pretty sturdy the top has two tabs per side and they gave me a hard time in staying down to give the container an airtight seal. Like I said, I'm not using it for food but for cleaning supplies so it didn't really break the deal for me but it might for someone else."
Currently using to store sugar and flour and am confident that the seal will hold for a longtime.
I love them. They are large enough to hold a 10lb bag of flour or sugar. They come with very nice black labels and a white ink marker to write what the contents are. Really nice.
"Containers arrived broken. Plastic separating 2 containers had melted, causing the ability to separate both containers impossible. Disappointed. Replacement order was sent out, but I had not request that, refund was supposed to go to my account instead. Replacement order arrived in same condition, unable to separate containers as they were stacked inside each other and plastic wrapper was melted."
"It's a great storage container, however, it says 10 piece storage container. It's my fault for not reading specifics. It's 5 tops and 5 containers. In my naivety I assumed 10 containers. Doesn't seem like tops should be their own count. Like I said, my bad. Great product though."
I purchased these for my husband's lunchbox and they are great. They hold quite a bit of food and they also stay latched. I have not put them in the dishwasher yet so I cannot say if they hold up there but they have done well with washing by hand and being used in the microwave.
"I really like these containers. They are great for meal prepping, stack perfectly, and you can stick 'em in the freezer with no problem. I wouldn't say they are leak-proof...more like leak-resistant (wouldn't put soup in one of these then toss in my purse), but they are sturdy. Love that they snap on all four sides of the container. Overall, would def recommend."
"I love these containers! Easy to use for meal prepping for the work week, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about anything leaking in my bag. Only downfall is the covers are a little hard to clean by hand."
"C√≥modos para llevar los alimentos, f√°cil para limpiar, no hay derrame"
these are perfect for my bulk spice orders to store and hold to refill my shakers
Quick delivery I‚Äôm using it for small parts storage of silver seal keeps out oxygen so no tarnish
This is my second set of Snapware. I LOVE them- This order was for a size that I use a lot and needed more of. I don't worry about leaks or stains and I love that they are made in the USA!
Sure fit lid that closes securly. Holds a pound of ground meat perfectly. It is a shallow container. It snaps open/close on all four sides. Washes nicely in middle dishwasher rack.
"Not at all flimsy. The seal alone is great,then it locks on each side. Way better than expected. Price is right. Im going to buy otger sizes. Very happy!üòÅ"
Just what I needed. Great product at a good price.
These plastic containers have made meal prep.easy for me. I fill them up and stack then in the refrigerator. Then I grab one each day.
They do what they say they will do.
Great stuff.
Love these containers
I think these were better than Tupperware. Love the sizes. Easy to open and easy to stack. I ordered extra.
"Definitely leak proof, and easy to clean. Not flimsy, very sturdy."
Great sturdy for plastic and perfect size for portion control
Stacks well and can see contents

"I ordered theses to place plastic utensils for storage. The size indicated in the description being 10 inches long is WRONG. These are about 6 inches long. The quality is fair. Containers are too small for much use perhaps a side dish, or maybe a small snack. Very disappointed in my order. I found correct measurements far below product description under users‚Äôs comments too late to prevent my mistake. Hopefully this will keep someone else from making the same."
"Easy to open and close, keeps food fresh. A 4 star rating only because one of the lids had a broken clasp, but it still seals ok with only 3 clasps."
Even though it clearly said in the description online it microwave safe I don‚Äôt agree. First used and it like this a already. I used three and all three have bubbles form on them already and it only microwave for 2 minutes each used.
"Very disappointed with this order. Two containers were totally useless; one could be used, but would not be airtight; and the last two were good. This order was sold by Amazon, so I expected better. The containers were a little bigger than I expected, so I did not realize that the price was too good to be true! I would NOT recommend."
"I did not receive what I ordered. The product description lists the dimensions as 9.5 x 7.5 x 10 inches. The items that I received are 6.5 x 2 x 4.5 inches. Not even close to what I ordered and what I need. Very disappointing as I need what I ordered very soon. These are very nice containers, but 0 stars for this experience"
"No kitchen should be without a bunch of Snapware unless your kitchen is just for looks and you never cook nor store leftovers from your takeaway.  These are the pinnacle of plastic storage:  BPA free Seal with a snap so you know they are sealed. Super strong seal does not leak. When not in use, they are nestable so they don't take up too much space. Stackable: They are strong enough that you can stack a few full containers on top of one another.  These are great for both food prep and food storage. On the storage side, they simply can't be beat:  Clear all around, so it is easy to see what is inside. No odor out of the box. Easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. Note: I have found that sometimes washing out a container that held spicy foods can have a lingering odor if hand-washed, but the dishwasher gets rid of the odor.  These are microwave, freezer, and dishwasher safe.  Snapware recognizes what makes for good food storage solutions and has produced a line of products that meet or exceed expectations in all areas. The variety of sizes and reasonable prices make it easy to find and acquire what you need for your prep and storage system."
"I have been tired of the containers in our house being hard to close, weird, shapes, or not easy to stack in the refrigerator. This set solves that.  HOW THESE COME These containers come in a large stack with a cardboard case.  DO THEY STACK? These containers stack when not in use which makes them VERY useful in saving cupboard space. The lids are flat so they can be stored also in a compact area.  AIRTIGHT/LEAKPROOF? These seem to be air tight and leak proof in my testing.  SIZE The size of these is perfect for small left overs or taking a meal to work. They are really nice.  CLEANING These are not difficult to clean and so far they are easy to maintain.  THE BOTTOM LINE These containers are a fantastic addition to my kitchen. I am considering replacing all of my containers with these due to saving room in storage and also usefulness.  MY RATING FIVE STARS. These are really nice containers. I am glad to have them and will probably purchase more."
"I consider Snapware a great find - the containers have completely eliminated my need for plastic wrap, and they bring terrific organization to my refrigerator. I have a vast assortment of Snapware (see pics), in various shapes and sizes, but this is the size I use most (by far). This set includes 5 rectangular containers, 6‚Äù x 4‚Äù x 2‚Äù - just right for one leftover portion - a half of a sandwich, a half a burger, or leftover chicken. They are airtight and leakproof, with a good solid seal, however I‚Äôm still careful with liquid storage. They nest and stack, really extend shelf life, and are also helpful to transport food."
"The Snapware Total Solution Plastic Set I'm a fan of!  This set shipped well with minimal packaging and no damage.¬† No weird odors or chemical-like smells were present at all.  I'm quite pleased with these. They are sleek in design and take up little space when not in use as they are nestable. They are also stackable which is great for my fridge that always seems to not have enough space.  I like I can clearly see what's inside from the sides and the top. The lids are designed that you can write atop with a dry erase marker to label the inner contents for best organizing.  The lids are easy to open and close. You know it is sealed properly when all sides snap shut and you hear the very audible sound. They have not leaked at all since I've been using them for over a month now.  They sport a solid thick plastic that leans more toward hard than soft. They can be washed by hand and by dishwasher. I have noticed no shrinkage, staining, warping, or any other concerning issues so far.  I like these and the fact they can be used to store more than just food.  The price is right for quality and quantity. Recommended!"
"I like these snapware plastic containers for the way the lids stay on so tight and for how durable they are. The plastic isn't perfectly clear, but it's clear enough for us to tell what's inside the containers. The snaps on the sides of the lids aren't difficult to snap closed, and they sure do stay closed quite well until they are opened by one of us in my household.  These have not yet leaked, and I'm hoping these last a long time and stay as nice as they are now. There is a bit more of a challenge in storing these when not in use because of the snap-flaps which stick out on the sides of the lids, but I've figured it out and think these are worth the trouble.  Also, because the way these are made, it does take a little bit more effort to ensure the lids are good and dry before putting these away (there's a little tunnel-like area where the lids snap onto the containers). Again, it's still worth it to me because I like these containers so much. Although these are a little pricey, as long as these function and last well, I'm happy with them. Thanks for reading."
"I have a set of SnapLock glass storage containers, and, while I prefer glass to plastic, they are heavy in comparison. These plastic containers seal just as well, and they are much lighter. They even take up slightly less room in the freezer because of their thinner walls. As all good storage containers should be, they are dishwasher-, freezer-, and microwave-safe.  I find this 3-cup size to be one of the most versatile. I use this and the 4-cup size (in glass) almost exclusively. It's perfect to send leftovers home with my mother since the containers are lighter and less breakable than the glass. I love that they are stackable, both filled and not.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
"When I'm at home, I have glass food storage containers that I use to meal prep all of my meals. The issue I've been having is when I travel for a few days... I don't want to bring my glass containers with me as I'm afraid of them breaking. I also haven't found any plastic ones I've liked as they don't snap closed and open in transit.  These have been my solution! I use these to make my overnight oats that I eat each day! These fit perfectly in my travel cooler bag and easily stack when I don't need them. I like that they don't take up much room and are very durable.  All in all, if you need meal prep containers that aren't glass - order these!"
"I did wonder whether I wanted several containers all the same size, but this is an incredibly practical size for leftovers and meal prep. They wash in the dishwasher, they snap super tightly, they don't even seem to leak. I put water in one of them with the lid closed and it didn't leak at all if snapped properly. They stack and they nest for storage. Just a super practical set of Snapware. I couldn't be happier."
"The product description for this set is not very clear, but the fine print does say these containers hold 3 cups each. Each container easily holds 3 cups of water with the lid sealed. This is a good single-serving size; not huge containers for holding a family-sized meal.  These are good plastic food storage containers for the $2.60 each price. The plastic is reasonably thick and durable and is microwave/freezer/dishwasher safe and BPA-free. The lids lock securely and there is an internal gasket so they are very leak-resistant."
"I've been using Snapware for years, and they keep improving it - first with molded-in gaskets, and now with a rounded bottom edge. These seal well, stack and nest well, and are very robust.  Nothing being perfect, the cardboard box the containers arrived in was hugely too big for the set. It's the same size as the box the set of larger rectangle containers is packed in (I also got that one), so maybe someone thought it would be nice if all the various sets fit into the same sized cardboard boxes? Why?"
"These 3 cup storage containers are made with quality plastic, they are durable and sturdy, not flimsy plastic like some. The lids are easy to close and seal tightly making them air tight and leak free. I am replacing all my old plastic containers with these new updated, I started with the Snapware 38 piece storage set, an excellent selection but I am adding to that set with the more common sized containers. These hold up well in the microwave and are easy to clean. They stack nice to save on space too."
"I threw out all of my cheap reusable Tupperware for these and I am so glad I did! These are so much better than the traditional Tupperware with snap on lids. With these, you know that when they are down and locked, the lid isn‚Äôt going anywhere. With my old Tupperware, sometimes the lids didn‚Äôt close the entire way without me realizing it. I‚Äôve had no issues with putting them in the microwave and they are easy to wash. I would recommend them."
"You can never have too many storage containers unless, of course, they're hard to store.  These rectangular containers all fit easily unused in a drawer. They nest and stack. In the freezer or fridge, their compact shape fits anywhere for leftovers or meal prep.  I've had other snapware items before and the lifetime warranty is amazing. Just take a picture of the item and they ship you a new one."
"These bowls have so many great features from the thick sturdy plastic, they nest inside each other and the lips stack on top to take up less room in my cabinet, and they are microwave/freezer/dishwasher safe and BPA-free. The lids lock by snapping down the sides and there is a rubber internal gasket so they are leak proof. I plan on getting more once my other bowls wear out."
"I've used snapware products for many years and I've been impressed. And I've had to replace some so these were perfect timing. The are easy to clean, easy to shut and mine don't leak. You have to make sure the lip is correctly positioned so it doesn't leak. They did change the shape a bit, they're slightly rounded edges, not so square."
"We have several of the snap ware sets, they are stronger than rubbermaid and last longer. The seals hold well and easy to toss from refrigerator to microwave to dishwasher. We usually buy the big set at Costco but rarely use some of the smaller sized containers. These are a great size and have bought several sets of them."
"While I love the (usual) added security of snap closures on plastic food storage containers like this, I can't say that in this case the feature really helps with leak prevention. If these containers are set on their sides or upside down, liquid does come out. It tends to seep out rather than come out all at once or in a fast leak or drip, but still...these are not leakproof as claimed and that was one of the big reason why I ordered these. Work lunches aren't always kept in a perfectly stacked and upright position so my family needs a solid, dependable storage container that absolutely WILL NOT leak. These might be fine for thicker liquids like gravy or creamy sauces, but anything more viscous/watery will end up leaking out into whatever lunch bag or cooler a person is using that day. Thing is, if liquid can get out, that means air can also get in. Food can spoil or go stale faster or dry out. If used to store food in a freezer, not being air tight leads to freezer burn. I also noticed that if the silicone seals/gaskets were removed to do a thorough cleaning (since food could get up underneath these seals) that the seals/gaskets ended up stretching juuuuuust enough to not fit back perfectly, and this further exacerbated the leak problem. Sure, I could've left the silicone seals in place, but I don't want to imagine what would grow under there if not cleaned properly. Ewwww. I ended up using this set and others like it I ordered for storing craft materials and various other bits of small household maintenance /repair items. Happily these do work well for storing non-food items so I still have a use for them.  Aside from not being leakproof, these containers also didn't really do well in the microwave. Some foods like acidic tomato sauce or foods with higher fat content ended up causing that weird looking etching of the plastic that looks like dried white foam even though these were supposed to be microwave safe. I tried to find out if their microwave safe claim was for under a certain wattage, but wasn't successful. Our microwave is like a nuclear reactor at 1700 watts so we end up cutting the cooking time and power level for just about everything so it doesn't get ruined. I also liked how while in use for food nothing stained the containers or lids, not even the usual culprits such as spaghetti sauce or chili.  I'm disappointed these containers didn't work as well as hoped. Other reviewers seemed to have better luck, so maybe it was a manufacturing issue as sometimes things don't get caught by QA inspections and end up going to consumers. I'm happy these have worked well for others, but my experience was a big disappointment."
"These are perfectly sized for leftovers for a small household of three people. I like that the lids snap securely closed, and are completely leak-proof. A plus is that they stack nicely, and the lids nest together. We will definitely get a lot of use out of these."
"I've gone tons of plastic food storage containers, and these Snapware containers are among the better ones. They seal tightly and securely. They're well made and have been holding up to cleaning in my dishwasher. I'm very happy with them."
This is my wife's favorite size Snapware container. The newer versions don't seem to get as brittle when frozen. I've dropped frozen containers a few times and haven't had lid parts shatter in all directions. Overall a good storage container for the $
These are my favorite type of containers with the 4 side snaps. These close tightly and stay closed.  They are the right size to do leftovers for one and easy to take to work. They microwave well and so far are surviving the deep freezer.
"This is a highly practical product. The seal is tight. The size is practical for small meals or snacks. They're stackable, thereby taking little space. And they're dishwasher safe (upper rack).  Excellent and highly recommended."
"My specific use case for the Snapware Total Solution Plastic Set was in packing lunches. You see, I'd previously gotten some Bento boxes, but there were some issues: they're expensive, they don't store well in my cabinets (because they're big, and don't stack well), and they have more utility than I need (I don't need multiple compartments).  At $13 for 5 containers, the Snapware set is much less expensive than those Bento boxes. They also stack really well, as you can nest all of the containers, and then nest the lids. The lids have a sealing gasket, and they snap in place from all 4 sides for a secure seal. The containers microwave and wash well, though the lids are a little awkward in the dishwasher rack.  I've started using these containers in the refrigerator for leftovers, so I'll probably get another set soon. They're way more convenient than some of my other plastic food storage containers, since I can easily identify what lid goes with what container (definitely a point of frustration with my Tupperware). Recommended"
Snap ware storage containers have been my go to choice for the past few years These stack and store nicely and are more durable than typical plastic ware
"This entire line of Tupperware is amazing, I think this is the first time I've actually purchased more of a product I got from Amazon Vine."
"I really like how these seal. They are well made, and leakproof. I haven‚Äôt used in the microwave yet but they do wash easily."
"Snapware Total Solution Plastic Set (10pc meal prep set)  This set is cheap, but it's great value imo. Snapware is legit, these are much better than off brand ones i've had. The size of this set is small, 3 smaller ones (clear) and 2 sliiiightly larger ones (with the usual blue seal around). They're almost the same size, but they stack well. The size is great for meal prep, I find some meal prep containers too big, and I HATE the disposable kind that doesn't reaaaally seal. These seal. The size is great for rice and chicken, and you can use the smaller one for extra stuff. For the price this is a great little set if you find your containers a tad too big."
"Nice leakproof, sturdy and durable set of Tupperware."
"These are great for food storage! I use them mostly to store bananas in the freezer for smoothies, and they hold up very well in the freezer and the dishwasher.  My only complaint is that the lids are awkward in the dishwasher, and it's not even really a complaint. It's just an observation. The way the sides are made makes them go in at kind of an odd angle sometimes.  But overall, I love these and would buy them again."
I got three different sets of this brand to replace my current Tupperware stash and they‚Äôre adequate. The plastic is a thicker sturdy plastic and holds up to the microwave and dishwasher. But unfortunately they leak.
I got these originally at Costco and wanted replacement ones. These were smaller than I wanted. They will only fit a side dish and not a whole meal for a lunch so I gave them away as a gift
I was pleased with the price and the durability of these. Stack nice in your cupboard. Your fridge. Even the freezer! Very air tight! No soup spills out ! Great product !
"These are the perfect size for taking to work for lunch. I keep my lettuce selection chopped in the container, have my other ingredients in snack bags (cranberries, toasted pecans, etc) and mix them all at lunch, add salad dressing and have the freshest salad ever!"
There is nothing I don‚Äôt like. The best is I meal prep these are stackable and freeze beautifully.
"Locks tight! No leaking, stackable, and perfect for nuts and dried fruits for yogurt mix-ins!"
Finally needed a new batch after 3 years of heavy use and abuse. Well worth the purchase.
These containers open and close easily with a nice seal.
"Muy burn art√≠culo, tama√±o ideal. Excelente vendedor"
Perfect for keeping contents fresh.
I ordered more sets
Perfect! Leak proof. Easy to use. Dishwasher safe. Couldn‚Äôt be happier.
"I make my husband lunches .. he loves the containers snap, lock in place easy to clean."
Not leakproof or stainproof...but pretty decent otherwise. They are sturdy and close pretty tight.
"DIMENSIONS The lid takes up 1 ¬Ω inch of the height (it goes down 5/8 of an inch into the container) and 7/8 from the top of the container to the top of the lid, making the lid 1 ¬Ω inch tall. (phew, hope all these details are understandable, I‚Äôm trying to give a very clear description.) I‚Äôm giving the total height of ‚Äúusable‚Äù space since the lid goes down somewhat, but they allowed for this in the design so they hold even amounts. Each one is square 3 ¬Ω x 3 ¬Ω 2 that hold 2 cups - measures 2 ¬º high 2 that hold 3 ¬Ω cups ‚Äì measures 4 ¬º high 2 that hold 5 cups ‚Äì measures 6 ¬º high 1 that holds 8 cups ‚Äì measures 10 ¬º high Don‚Äôt forget to add 1 ¬Ω inches (lid) to these height measurements. EXAMPLE: The small container has 2 ¬º inches of ‚Äúusable‚Äù space + 1 ¬Ω = 3 ¬æ total height.  When a couple of reviews said they were easy to open, they weren‚Äôt kidding. It was an understatement. I‚Äôve had surgeries on both thumb joints and my right hand is especially weak and hurts to even hold a pencil. With these containers, I‚Äôm able to flip the lid open with one hand using my right hand that is so sore. They‚Äôre very sturdy"
"They're fine. The measurements are a bit smaller than advertized, as some other reviews have mentioned. The canisters are pretty flimsy, they feel like the plastic will break if you look at them wrong. The chalk marker included with mine was dried out and did not write well at all, but that's fine. Not why I bought these.  My real issue is the lids. They are a nightmare. They are pretty junky. The soft plastic (""silicone"") seals don't sit evenly, and sometimes fold over themselves when they close. The locking mechanism causes the lids to close at bizarre angles which is mildly irritating. The lids are not water-tight, so when I washed them, I had to take every lid completely appart to dry them, otherwise they pooled up with water inside the lid or inside the seal, or both.  They work fine, for what I bought them for, but I would definitely not recommend them or buy them again."
I bought these to make a beautiful kitchen that is more organized. The lids seal is great. It is air tight. The material is plastic good for dry goods to store in my pantry. I like the look of it and the fact they stack up on each other.  Con- does NOT come with labels.
"I love that these are easily opened with one hand, and seal very well. I make my own ""skinny"" hot cocoa mix, and use the medium ones to store it in, one for home and one for the office. The small one works great as a ""sugar bowl"" - easy to open for a spoonful of sugar, but seals tightly. The only issue I have is that if you wash the lids with them ""open"", water will get inside the lid and take forever to dry. It really tested my patience because I was so eager to fill these up and put them in the pantry! But after using them, there will probably be times when you will need to open them for a thorough washing. Based on some other reviews, I ordered a separate set of labels and pen, and while the labels were the same, the pen that came included with this was much less effective than the one that came with the separate set. All in all, I like them a lot and will likely buy more when I get my new pantry!"
I was excited to receive this containers since I need them to organize my baking supplies. It was easy to wash them just with water and soap. I can‚Äôt wait to use them I Will be updating with a picture of them been used
The ounces on the packaging are nowhere close to reality. I tried to put a 12 ounce box of cereal in the 28 ounce container and it and it only took about half the box. So it is more like 6 to 8 ounces not 28. So whatever the volume is just remember it about half of what they say. So I basically need to find a use for them and buy ones that are more accurate. Overall it is false advertising but since I already put stuff in them I am guessing I can't return them. Brutal!
"A lot smaller than I thought, but I made it work. Most of the items I containerized were already opened and used, so new items will not fit. Seems air tight as I was able to grab the top without it opening. Definitely stackable, compact, and came with labels. Labels are located in the long ""spaghetti"" container. Despite the size, I made it functional and happy with it."
"I love the storage containers! They make my pantry look so much nicer and organized. The clear plastic makes it easy to see the products inside, and the tops are so easy to open and close! That was one of the important features I looked for because of arthritis in my hands. The labels are erasable and can be used over and over. I was able to get rid of half bags and boxes of snacks, beans, pasta, etc. taking up space in my small pantry, and we now can see what we have in there! A couple of the containers are smaller than I thought they would be, but still useful for so many things, so I will be ordering larger ones for sugar, flour, etc. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
"I have been looking for replacement a to my counter clutter of Tupperware. Decided to give these a try. Was surprised how well packed in box they were. Strong and sturdy butblightweight. Handl d most of my pasta and takes a fraction of the space my Tupperware did. WILK be ordering another set to complete ypasta and grains. Then onto cerals, snacks and baking supplies!"
"These are easy to use and stackable feature is great for storage. 1 of the smaller containers came broken cracked and had issues trying to replace with Amazon so, contact seller directly if any issues. They sent a full new set out to me (not just broken one) directly- received within 2 days and none broken. Very good price for the amount of products compared to Oxo, have not used very often yet so can‚Äôt speak for vacuum seal over time yet. *Side note- The 2nd biggest size (qty 2) fits a box of pasta (14-16 oz rotini/macaroni dry) perfectly, the smallest (qty 2) fits the small cans of nuts perfectly."
I really like the different sizes available in this set of containers. When I ordered them I was a little skeptical but they have measured up. I cook for one and I buy in small quantities so these are perfect for me. And the fact that they are so easy to stack in the pantry is a double bonus. They don't fall apart with a little tap here and there. I'd recommend them to anyone!
"The containers are very well made and sturdy. The only reason for the 3 star review is because they are really small. I was looking to be able to store larger amounts of dry goods, not one box of macaroni. That being said, I‚Äôm keeping them because I can store tea, coffee and maybe some spices I use a lot of. If these containers were all 4x bigger than what they are they would be perfect. I would even pay a little more for that."
These are incredible!! The lids lock on tight and the containers are sturdy. They did great in the dishwasher and are deeper than you expect. These are a must have!!! You know they must be good if I‚Äôm writing a review. What have I become ‚Ä¶ I used to have dreams and goals in life and now I‚Äôm using my time to write a storage container review.
"These are the perfect storage organizers. The value for the money is absolutely fantastic! I have another brand that I purchased from a retail store that‚Äôs double in price. These work so much better, and the airtight seal is absolutely fantastic! Why spend more money in the retail stores when you can get these for half the cost?!"
"These arent huge but will hold a box of spaghetti noodles, bag of dried peas or rice. The lids are awesome, fit tight and lock on. The white marker on the black labels tends to smear so be careful writing on them."
"I live in the tropics, so humidity is a big issue here. Specially if Im a bread lover trying to pursue a low carb diet. Which means I need to make all my bread from scratch out of low carb ingredients.  So...looking for a way to protect my flours and ingredients from humidity and bugs, I came across these! They are stylish and found their sizes to be just perfect. :)"
"I am very pleased. I purchased these storage containers to organize my kitchen cabinets. I have limited space, so these were very instrumental in making the most of that space. They are sturdy, stackable, came with stick on labels and are attractive. And since they are clear, you can easily see the contents."
I purchased a similar set at Costco for $60. This set is half the price and almost as nice. I bought 2 sets. Would highly recommend. U would buy more as gifts.
"They seem to be very durable and airtight. And I like the clear containers very much.  However, I would love to have these made in larger sizes to accommodate the 5lb flour and sugar packages.  The smaller ones are harder to find use for."
"Though I was under the impression these would be larger in size, they are of great quality and a great addition to my kitchen. I use them for my kids snacks, rice, chocolate chips, etc. the chalk marker stays in place with no smudges though does easily come off with water when switching products. Overall I love them!"
Have been looking for storage like this for quite awhile ! This is a clever & sturdy set that exceeded my needs and expectations! The built in measuring spoons and hidden extras are icing on the cake ! Highly recommend !!
Perfect size for kitchen counter. Bought this product previously. Original set has a plastic lock; several had broken. When I saw lock had been replaced I purchased a new set but advised Cineyo about past problem They promptly replaced original set. Am very hopeful that new lock will be more serviceable
"These are great containers. They seal properly and come in different sizes. They are compact but big enough to store pasta, flour and coffee as well as other things. We liked them so much we bought a set for my daughter."
I thought I ordered black tops to go with my kitchen better so I exchanged for black. I wanted something nice to put my husband's coffee in as he likes to let it set beside the coffee maker in the counter. They are slender and can stack to save additional space. They also work great in the pantry.
"These containers are not only attractive, but they work so easily and the accompanying labels make everything so organized. I love these containers. I‚Äôve already ordered two sets and plan on getting more"
I looked forward to receiving these airtight containers. All kids work properly. My cabinets look so much better (organized/uniformed). I definitely recommend them to all.
"Just as the title says, the seals slip a small bit, but they remain air tight. The labels are great and there are more in case you want to change them out. I use them for all sorts of things. They look great too."
"Updated... customer service is amazing. Will buy from again, helped with the problems I had with the items. Thanks again. Pretty flimsy, dropped one and broke down side, lids hold a lot of water so don't submerge then when you wash."
"Loved the different sizes. Used for pantry raisins, cranberry raisins, pasta noodles, cereal, anything loose in a box. Wanted to eliminate some paper box items. The air tight seal is good, and I'm happy with product."
I did have one crack from a previous set; therefore I do not think it was a durable as I expected. Overall they are a great container set for the price.
"I loved these so much that a bought a second set. They‚Äôre air tight and fit wonderfully on my rollout pantry shelves. They also look nice on my kitchen counter. (My dog now knows exactly where I keep her treats!) the only negative is I do prefer the mid size and larger size. I don‚Äôt find a lot of uses for the small ones. Wish there was a choice in sizes on the type of sets to order. Overall, very satisfied with the product."
Great product. It‚Äôs priced cheaper than competitors and is built well enough that I know my contents will stay fresh. Would recommend! I do wish they did come with more of the large containers or a 2nd option for it.
Trying to prevent a bug problem and I have all different sized dog treats. This makes them visible and air tight. Used it for dishwasher pods as well.
The tallest container came broken. This company handled this promptly. They went above and beyond my expectations to achieve customer satisfaction. Kudos to them. The products are the best I‚Äôve had.
I like this storage solution a lot. The flush design of the lids allows you to put them in your space side by side without a lot of wasted space.
"I really like how easy to seal these are! They‚Äôre advertised well, because the sizing is superb! I live in a fifth wheel camper and I needed something to help me organize - getting away from bags all together. This product at this price is also great, Walmart did not have pricing on containers like this because they were smaller packages for more cost. OVERAL PRODUCT RATING IS A 10 OUT OF A 10!! As always, read and be aware of what you‚Äôre buying from Amazon."
"Exactly what I needed. I was initially hesitant because others reviews said it was small, but I‚Äôm so glad I got these. The sizes are perfect for me. Will they store a costco size bag of flour? No but that‚Äôs not what I am needing. There‚Äôs 4 different sizes to fit your needs. I accidentally ordered the wrong color and I still love these. Also loved that each one was wrapped in bubble wrap. Over all, happy with the purchase!"
The canisters were a gift. I haven't used them so I can't speak to how well they work. They do look nice and stack well. I'm sorry this isn't much help.
"Well made, the top lays flat to the canister so no worries about spilling. Very good product for the price. Will be buying again.üñ§"
From bath salts to kitchen food items........these seal well and work great throughout my home! They are durable and airtight seals!
The only negative thing that I can say is that they are not dishwasher proof. I hand washed all of the upon delivery and now am happily using them for storage of food stuffs.
Was so excited to renovate my kitchen I had to get these to complete my organization. They are great for what was needed.
They work just as advertised. Time will tell. I am disappointed that there is no mention of NOT BEING DISH WASHER SAFE. I did run all on the lightest setting o could obtain. Came out okay
"The task seemed daunting considering the disarray my pantry was in. But once I got started on my pantry cleanup, I was amazed how much room I had available once I emptied contents into the containers and I loved how organized everything looks now. Going to buy more!!"
"Pens√© que eran un poco m√°s anchos. Pero est√°n bien. Son muy bonitos y modernos. A mi esposa e hija les encantaron. Lo que m√°s me gust√≥ es su cierre herm√©tico. F√°cil de usar. No llegaron el marcador ni las etiquetas, pero no es necesario al ser transparente."
"These containers are great! Easy to open them and easy to clean. Also, customer service is exceptional!! I am so happy my purchase!"
"Came quickly, easy to set up, already my pantry is much more functional. Love the little stickers and white markers"
I love it. Not made cheap. Looks just like the pic. Came with extra labels that I could use on containers I already had. Very satisfied
This seems perfectly good. Can't believe I paid WAY more than this for similar product at Walmart.
My daughter uses these for everything from pasta in her kitchen to q-tips in the kids bathroom. Sturdy and easy to use and clean!
"Cute! Just get them. Makes a great gift, doesn't take up much room, air tight, just as pictured."
"I got one set at first, then i purchased another one. Really like them.  The kitchen looks much better now with them."
These containers are great. The tops fit perfectly and are easy to get on and off. I was having trouble finding good food containers . THESE ARE THE BEST AND FOR A GREAT PRICE! So happy with them! I usually don't write reviews but these are so good that I just had to rave about them!
Love how they look and they definitely stay airtight. Glad I went with these!!
The sizes are great they are very sturdy and close perfectly I liked them so much I ordered another set
I really like the two way locking system on these. Will find many things to store in them.
I have a VERY small kitchen and every inch of counter space is usable! This helps so much! Thanks!
I looks the top closure very snug fits nicely in my cabinet which gives me space plan on buying some more
I like the product because it allowed me to manage my pantry better. The containers are very good for their purpose.
Some smaller containers for spices and larger for cereal.
They‚Äôre great for storing candy cookies and anything else you like. Will buy some more
"These containers provide compact storage and secure lids that are easy to seal. I have arthritis and although I have used and loved Tupperware for years, I can‚Äôt cope with the lids now and get them properly sealed."
Love these! Super easy and adorable! Durable and secure. Definitely recommend.
"Product functions with a tight fit, but are easy to open. Perfect for what I need."
"Using for all my ""seeds"". Chia, hemp, flax. Also for pasta, rice and teas."
"My other storage containers are usually round but after using this ones, which are squares. I noticed a lot more space for storage."
These containers are awesome! You can put practically anything in them and it will stay fresh!! I am going to get more‚Ä¶.cereal containers next!!
great assorted sizes that fit well together for space saving storage. Easy to open and close and vacuum sealing keeps everything fresh
These food storage container are excellent for storing food products and freeing up space in the pantry. I love them.
Excellent food storage. Highly recommended.
"I've had these bags for over a year now and am able to give a thorough review. First of all, I really do love these bags. I've used them pretty consistently the past year with packed lunches and outings. I still use disposable bags, but not as often. Since using these bags I've only had to buy 2 boxes of disposable bags!!! Talk about a great way to reduce trash and save money! My only complaint is after about 6-8 months of using these, the zipper seal started getting harder to close. It's still workable, but it's tough and I wouldn't trust putting liquids in it. These aren't dishwasher safe, but cleaning them out was pretty easy."
"I love these! I didn't realize how many plastic bags I used before. These are so easy to clean. Wash them with soapy water and dry upside down on an upside down cup. They're ready to use super fast. I will for sure buy more so that I can freeze stuff in them. I use them for open block cheese, freezing homemade cookie dough, kids snacks, etc.. you should buy 2 sets for sure. You'll love them. I bought my best friend some."
I hand wash bc if used in the dishwasher they are harder to close. But still never going back to disposable ever again. Love these. So easy to clean even when hand washing
The hardest part of these are the drying after washing...otherwise I love them!
These were a great purchase. I have foregone all Ziplocs and just use these. They are thick and durable and I just flip them inside-out to clean them. I definitely recommend.
Excellent
The fact that I can wash and re use is everything
I really like these bags they work well just once I put pasta with some sauce in the bag and there was a sauce stain ! But all in all very cool to use !!
Son muy √∫tiles
These are great. Easy to seal. Wash and reuse. Economical
"These bags are the best. I've had them for over a year now and I could not be more thrilled with them. I learned my lesson the hard way that they are not dishwasher safe. They are easy to clean, however, drying them is a different story. We are actually using an old jewelry rack to dry them. They are absolutely leak proof and it's great to have a bunch in different sizes. They do a better job of keeping fresh foods longer as well and it's nice to know I'm not throwing away plastic bags."
Easily stains and hard to clean without dishwashing. Maintains food or soap smell. Too small even for the different sizes to hold any amount of food. Waste of money.
"Wonderful for the kitchen. Good for the environment. Also great for travelling to protect passport, Phone, electronics from rain and water. You could crawl under a waterfall and your valuables would be perfectly dry and safe. If you travel by boat or canoe, leave plenty of air inside and if they fall in the water, they will stay afloat."
"These bags are great. Very durable and handy for frozen things and things like nuts, coffee, cooked beans. Easy to hand wash, then open them over the prongs in the empty dishwasher to let dry. Much easier to clean than store bought plastic zip bags. Definitely recommend! üëç"
These reusable bags are awesome!!! No more waste! They are easy to clean. I do recommend purchasing plates organizer for drying purposes.
"I love these! The price was great! Honestly my only complaint is that you cant fit as much in them as regular ziploc bags because of the thick zipper so I usually end up using a bigger bag than I need, taking up more room in my lunch bag but it's still so worth it not having to purchase &waste all the bags!!! Very easy to clean!"
Being mostly locked down in 2021 showed me just how much one-yime use plastic my household used. I had received a few reusable storage bags from a mo they subscription service I use and absolutely loved them. I decided to start moving away from all one-time use products so these reusable bags were the prefect set to purchase. We use them for everything & I highly recommend them!
Sandwich bags lasted a little over a year. After that time would not seal. Small and a bit hard to get a sandwich in there. Hand washed these bags daily.
Doesn‚Äôt want to seal as easy as the other brand I got
I can't get them apart. They are really stuck together.
Great first school lunches. Annoying to clean but no regrets honestly.
These do NOT zip close easily after one use
"I love how they don‚Äôt leak! They are durable in the fridge and in the freezer. I‚Äôve used them multiple times, they are easy to clean and reuse. I would buy them again!"
these suck no dishwasher and hard to wash
"They clean out well but drying them is a little inconvenient, but worth the environmental pluses"
Not only are they reused they keep foods fresh.
Any remedy ideas? How to use these?
"They don‚Äôt stay closed at all. Some do, some don‚Äôt. I would purchase something else instead."
"These bags are okay. However they are difficult to close, the ridges aren't straight or something so you have to close it bit by bit to make sure it gets clicked in. Haven't tried anything liquidy because it's hard to tell if it's sealed closed. The small size is also really really small! When you take account for having to seal it closed these just isn't room for much, especially something with bulk to it. May be good for seeds or small nuts, but not veggies or cereal. Overall I use the original brand I bought instead and these only if I run out of the other."
"These are nice but kind of bulky. I like the thickness, durability, and the easy closure. It's easy to clean but hard to dry."
Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect
It closes perfect !
"Do not put in dishwasher. They melt. I was shorted bags, good product"
Durable and great locking system.
"Very useful and easy to clean, high quality"
Great investment don't have to buy zip locks at all anymore helping save the earth is what we all need to do.
I am happily satisfied with my purchase. The quality of the product is great and I‚Äôve cut down so much on using ziplock plastics.
These reusable bags are fabulous!
I loved this product. It kept my food fresh for longer periods and the best thing is that they are reusable. 100% recommended.
Awesome replacement of traditional zip lock bags.
"Seal is not tight. I tested this bag on a trip. I put some chocolate covered coffee beans in one of the bags, and then into my purse. By the end of the flight half of the beans were on the bottom of my purse."
"We‚Äôve been using these reusable bags for over 2 1/2 months. My main concern was whether they would last long enough to be cost effective. With almost daily use (the 2 smallest sizes are used for school lunches), they are holding up well. Very pleased with this purchase!"
Love all the different sizes
So far durable.. will see how they last
"The smallest bags work well, but any of the larger ones fall apart nearly as soon as something touches their seams."
The sizing is way off! None of the bags are actually the correct size
I really love these bags they work great
Great quality. Cleaned up good. Durable material
The seal is great but sometimes a little hard to open‚Ä¶.
"I bought these to replace the many many plastic ziplock bags I used to use. I got a set of 24 and so far they are enough for my regular use. I‚Äôm so glad I got them! I use them for my kids lunches and for pantry snacks and leftovers!  Edited to add: after about a month, 2 of the snack sized ones have stopped zipping. :( it‚Äôs disappointing"
Already so excited. Trying to cut back on wasteful plastic is slot harder then we thought. But these make it way easier to be ecofriendly in our food storage
J‚Äôadore
"They‚Äôre sturdy, leak proof, and easy to use. We love them so much we ordered a second set!"
Great product!
"I just got these yesterday and today I went to wash them before I start using them and trying to wash and dry the inside is IMPOSSIBLE. Soap and water stick to the corners and the inside stick together when wet, so air drying them isn‚Äôt an option unless you want mold bacteria transferring on your food . I‚Äôve spent over 45 minutes trying to dry these and somehow there are some spots inside that are STILL wet despite folding the towel over both sides of my hand and putting my other hand over my hand with the towel from on top of the bag to weigh down the top side isn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôd give it 5 stars if cleaning and drying weren‚Äôt impossible"
"A great buy for the price and quality. I've been using the small size for mask storage. I used self-laminating labels so that each family member has a safe and clean pouch to store their fabric masks for any outings.  The medium and large sizes are used in the kitchen to store opened packs of hot dogs, deli meats, and cheese.  They are easy to wash with a bottle brush, soap and hot water. Drying is a bit more difficult if you're cleaning multiple simultaneously as they need to be propped up with cups to dry thoroughly. I tend to dry them overnight so that I can put them away in the morning and have clear counter space to use during the day."
"Products shipped right away. The quality is really amazing and it's made with that very thick (not completely transparent) material. They close like traditional sandwich bags but even the closures are well made. After using for my baby food puree blocks, I loved these so much and decided to buy some for my grandma who loves to store food in her freezer. Definitely a great buy."
I was so looking forward to using the bag... we just had them for less than a month and a couple have already ripped; they are also not closing anymore... you have to press super hard to just get some of it to lock!! I am so disappointed with the bags' performance!! I DEMAND MY MONEY BACK !!!
"Mise √† jour : D√©√ßue car fuite. Le c√¥t√© d'un sac a carr√©ment ouvert Apr√®s 2 utilisations l√©g√®res. Je n'ose plus utiliser les autres par peur d'un autre d√©g√¢t. Concept int√©ressant. La durabilit√© √† essayer. 1 des sacs contient une mati√®re collante qui ne part pas au lavage. Donc inutilisable, je suis d√©√ßue. Le s√©chage n'est pas rapide dans les coins. Alors faut essuyer."
"These reusable ziplock bags are great. The ziplocks work well, there's been no leakage, and they clean up nice. Will recommend these to my friends."
These bags are great. They are nice and thick and hold an appropriate amount of food. I use them to hold snacks for my children to use in their lunch bags. They protect and insulate the food and are easy to open and close.
"Love those bags! Super practical, easy to wash, and good for the environment. I will never go back to ziplocs after using these!"
The bags a small for the cost hope there is no bad chemicals in them
Love them!!! Will buy more when/if needed.
Id√©al
Parfait!!! Tel quel
"User-friendly, reusable, not very easy to clean and dry out"

We hated the waste of disposable storage bags and these do the trick!

"I've had two of this exact style container for nearly 14 years and they're still going strong, and which have been a bedrock of my home cooking/containing needs, but a not very helpful and radical change to the lid design years ago left me heartbroken that I had been too cheap to purchase a ""complete"" set when they were initially available (and quite pricey). I was overjoyed and even a little skeptical to find the older lid design again available here, along side the updated version (I must not have been the only critic of the updated lid design) and have been pleasantly surprised that they've reissued the older design with only minor updates/reinforcements? buttressing the corners of the bottom buckets. These otherwise are the exact same size, shape, weight, quality of materials and interoperability as the older versions and I'm hoping and looking forward to another 14+years of useful service. I will report back here if I find any differently."
"Love seeing my food in crystal clear containers (looks more appealing) ‚Ä¢ Stack well by connecting into each other and into the Rubbermaid Premier swirl-style containers with the bluish/purplish tops ‚Ä¢ The 3- & 5-cup sizes were exactly what we needed based on our frequent use of our older set ‚Ä¢ I chose these over glass containers and the Rubbermaid Brilliance because the tops are easier and faster to open and close for everyone especially my 8-yr old without all the extra snaps to click into place (if you have young children that you want to be more independent and not have to call on you to close the snaps on containers, get these! She does this with the two glass containers we have) ‚Ä¢ We only use these for storing food (I try to avoid microwaving in plastic when possible) ‚Ä¢ In love! üòç"
"Update After I bought this containers, I have been researching the safety of these containers. The Premier version of the Rubbermaid containers are made of a plastic with commercial name of Tritan. Tritan is the product by Eastman Chemicals company. Based on info on Eastman's website, Tritan is safe and have a number if regulatory agency approvals, including the US FDA. However, there was a claim by another private research which claimed Tritan leaches chemicals that are harmful. Eastman did sue the entity and won the lawsuit. You can research the topic online and make your own conclusions.  There are 7 types of plastic resins used in packaging. You will find the plastic identification number stamped on the container. For example, #5 indicates poly propylene. Type #1 to #6 indicate specific plastic; where as, Type #7 is a catch all which means something other than #1 to #6.  Tritan containers are labeled as #7 plastic which means you cannot tell what is made of by just looking at the label.  The common Rubbermaid containers with red lid are made #5 plastic which is polypropylene. This plastic is used extensively in food packaging and it is considered safe. Rubbermaid sell these ( red top) containers through grocery chains extensively. In contrast, the Premier (Tritan) Rubbermaid containers are not as widely distributed.  If I knew what I know now, I would have bought the red top Rubbermaid containers. At any rate, to minimize chemical leaching, I plan to use my containers only for food storage. I would not use them for warming or cooking food. Note you should wash the containers before first use.  Original Review I bought the Rubbermaid Premier set that has 14 containers. They are nice and good. I also bought two additional 5 cup Premier containers at the same time. All have grey lids. However the lids for the two additional containes have designs that are different from those used for container set and they do not stack with same size lids from the container set. There is no indication in the two Amazon product descriptions that tells you the two types of lids used. You cannot tell the difference from the looking at the pictures on Amazon. The paper labels on the individually bought containers indicate ""Easy Clean"" lids. I wish Rubbermaid made the two lid designs of different colors so that the differences are obvious. At list give the two designs a different product names, for example, ""Premier with Easy Clean Lid"" and ""Premier with Standard Lid""."
"If you're here, you might have a cabinet in your home that keeps you god fearing: you know every time you open it you pray an avalanche of plastic junk doesn't all fall out. Perhaps you're turning to your fellow consumer to see if its worth spending a few extra bucks on buying the good stuff. I can assure you, it is. The beauty of this product is you get 4 different sized containers, but only 3 different sized lids meaning your biggest two containers all share the same sized lids. This makes finding the right lid so much easier! On top of that (yes I'm a dad... pun intended), the lids snap together creating one Megatron lid. Moreover the big containers all stack neatly.  If you can't tell I came from a very Danny Tanner perspective on organization being front and center, but this product is great in all the ways you want your storage containers to be: sturdy, lids seal well, crystal clear, and they all match. It is also made in the USA, which is a big bonus.  In summation, fellow consumer I implore you to buy this. Once you get it and wash your new stash of containers throw that mismatched pile of old containers away (yes even your favorite ones). Together we can fight entropy and order can reign supreme."
"These three items are worth the price. If you are a fan of these, you know they wear down from usage and being run in the dishwasher. So you go to Bed/Bath/Beyond to get a replacement and you have to buy a whole set and the set comes with the tiny ones that are useless (at least for me). Getting these three larger storage containers is the bomb!"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these bowls and lids! The bowls do not stain, but I found that putting the lids in the microwave with tomato-based products can cause a little staining on the clear part of the lids, so I do not do that anymore."
i had a set of these before and I really love the red lids. Apparently they're not making the red anymore. so I opted for the black. This set is nice large bowls. The other set i had did eventually go bad but it lasted quite some time so I opted to purchase another set. Eventually the inside of thew bowl did start to kind of peel or crack....possibly because I do put these in my dishwasher. They might last longer if you don't do that.
"Haven't done much of the typical torture test for plastic storage (spaghetti sauce reheating), but for everything else, this system is great. Love the interlocking feature not only for stacking in storage, but also for stacking to go. You can stack full containers on one another and they click together. Great for grabbing lots of leftovers out of the fridge, which we've been doing a lot of during the pandemic. No dropping containers on your toes when they slide off of one another. Just click together and carry with confidence to the other side of the kitchen. Love the super-clear plastic, too. Looks much nicer than the cloudy, textured stuff. Lids go on straight down (starting at one corner will make them a little tough to push on due to tall sealing grooves), and seem to fully seal. I haven't exactly tried to make any of them leak, but they have been keeping leftovers fresh. Sizes are pretty good, but I wish we had some longer, flatter containers, too. We've been using these over our Lock-n-Locks lately, and we've always loved those, too."
"I already had these same kind of clear rubbermaid containers and loved them. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt last forever because the users occasionally forget that cooking high fat items in the microwave with them is a no no. I needed some replacements and more containers since I‚Äôm doing more cooking now with CV19 and was very happy to find these at a reasonable price. As mentioned by others, the lids do get water stuck in the edges so you usually have to dry them by hand (top rack in dishwasher). Not that hard, to so its no biggy to me. I really like them. I would buy again."
"I love these. The best thing I love about them is that you can see through them and they are stain resistant. No more staining with tomato sauces. The sizes are great too. I don't like the lids as much as the older style ones. They work great and are nicer looking, but I just prefer the old style lids. These take up a little more room and I don't think they snap on as tight as the old style, but easier to use. The old style fit lids fit these bases too, so I can use my old lids if I want."
These were an upgrade from the containers I have. The lids click on the containers really well which keeps them from coming off easier and it seems to help keep the food fresher. They are really nice looking and seem very durable. I took some to a dinner party that had vegetables in them and I did not have time to stop to get my party dishes out of my storage unit. They were nice clear containers that they did not look bad sitting out and not one person cared to notice. The old-style plastic would turn colors after using them. Not these. It comes with a total of 28 pieces which also makes this a great set for the price.
"I‚Äôve had the purple containers for several years and have been very happy with them. I bought the large set from Costco, and even though there were really enough in that set, I still wanted more of the large ones because it has been so convenient to cook healthy dinners and desserts ahead of time. I haven‚Äôt found any more of those sets anywhere but I found the grey premier large containers here. They arrived quickly and stack with the others! I‚Äôm very pleased and highly recommend this set especially if you don‚Äôt need the smaller containers. The tops are not difficult to close once you get the hang of learning that you need to start at one corner and the work your way around to get the proper seal. Everyone who comes to my house and sees these containers, wants to take leftovers so they can swipe them‚Ä¶.you‚Äôve been warned! üòÑ"
"These food storage containers are really great. Tight seal, useful sizes, stack so incredibly efficiently in the cabinet, and the titan plastic has never stained (though they do get little melt lines from microwaving too hot and get hairline cracks over time probably from our heated dishwasher. These issues take literal years to form, and I consider them as part of the aging and wear process). We‚Äôve used them for probably ten years plus, just replacing them at the big C membership store every once in a while when they go on sale.  It seems that Rubbermaid may be phasing the Premier collection out, unfortunately, so I got these to supplement our aging collection and was so happily surprised to find that they are the old style lids! This is as of August 2020."
I LOVE these containers. When I moved into our new home 11 years ago I bought all new storage containers. They are still looking like new and not one problem with them. I just bought this set to have a couple sizes that I didn‚Äôt already have. They stack well and don‚Äôt take up a lot of space. I love that the covers are interchangeable for different containers. They don‚Äôt stain with spaghetti sauce and are easy to clean. All go in the dishwasher- freezer and microwave. Well worth the investment. üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
"I loved this set so much, that I decided to just replace all my other containers with these! I have had them for a little over one year now and have used them almost daily for the past year, with leftovers or meal prep. they have been used in the microwave, ran through the dishwasher, and seen the most red spaghetti sauce Lol! not a single bit of stain adheres to the plastic! They are still just as crystal clear as the day I bought them. If you've ever had issues with other storage containers absorbing stain or odors over time, I would highly suggest giving these a try! They also stack nicely, lids and all which is a plus!"
The containers are bulky in the cabinet but so worth it. I bought two orders and I can finally cook with enough containers. They seal perfectly and do not leak. There is a trick to getting the lids on which is annoying: you have to pull it up to get the lip of the lid over the container edge. I would definitely buy these despite the faults.
"I've been buying rubbermaid's anti-stick containers for a few years now. The first batch I got was dark purple tinted with the floral pattern!  These work amazingly well. And there are so many in this single pack. Love how they stack to save some space, even the lids!  They tend to last for a few years, eventually start forming very small cracks that do lead to leaks. I believe this is related to the application of extreme heat/very hot food being put directly into it. So far I've taken care regarding very hot food and microwaving, and they've held up well."
"Super impressed! I spent longer than I would like to admit researching new Tupperware. I am thrilled that I chose to go with these! I bought them for my sister-in-law for Christmas so like them so much I wanted to keep them. And the spirit of Christmas, I went ahead and wrapped hers for her, and after hearing her reviews, I finally bit the bullet and purchase them. I replaced an entire cabinet full of mismatched Tupperware over the years with this set, and still have a ton of room on the same shelf. I'm very impressed!"
"Love these. They are almost identical to my old Rubbermaids (I had round and square ones). Was looking to replace them and these were perfect. Would love to replace my round ones as well. These are square, stainless (dont discolor from tomato sauce), they don't leak and the lids stay on. My old ones eventually cracked but I had them for many, many years!"
"This is the third or fourth set of these I have bought ... they come is a wide variety of assortments. Every time I think I have enough, someone decides to cook more than I need and I wind up wanting to freeze some and these containers are the best. This last set was needed because I froze some stuff for a camping trip. I do use a lot of them saving leftovers, too. And others in my household also feel free to use them. :-) I highly recommend."
"Rubbermaid has two different lid configurations. The first set I bought had these excellent lids that seal well and also seal to stack. I am well pleased with these. They do well in the top rack of the dishwasher, stack well in the fridge or freezer, and they keep food very fresh. The second set I ordered (which I thought was a 'reorder these' had a simple snap-on lid, not the same quality at all, and I retuned them. If you are looking for good Rubbermaid food storage containers, make sure you have the lid configuration that you want. It makes a difference."
"I have been using these sizes for years and I mean years. They were first clear with black lids, then lavender swirled designs with purple lids and now, clear with charcoal lids. I‚Äôm so ecstatic that I found just these sizes again!!! These square design containers which stack and snap together are the all time best and utilize literally every ‚Äúsquare‚Äù inch of space! Round containers, in my opinion just waste valuable space. I just love these containers since I cook in batches and then freeze in portions so they fit perfectly in my freezer. My freezer looks like ‚ÄúTetris‚Äù... lol. Storing them when not in use is a cinch since they‚Äôre interlocking, save you space in your cabinets and they‚Äôre so neatly organized at your fingertips! Please don‚Äôt ever discontinue these! They are gems!!!"
"I had a set of red-top Rubbermaid Premier Space Savers and I love them because they don't stain and they stack neatly in my cabinet. A few of them had started to develop cracks in the bottom, though (not from using a dishwasher - possibly from moving from refrigerator to microwave). So, I searched for more, but the red tops have been discontinued. These grey top containers use the same design lid as the red ones, so they all stack together neatly. (Note: there are some new grey top containers that have a new design for the lid that doesn't nest into the old red tops.)"
"I got this set to replace all the old carry out containers I use as storage, as well as the cheap disposable storage containers, most with missing lids. this set looks great - is easy to store, the variety of sizes holds everything I need and stacks well in my fridge. I love the clear glass-look of the plastic since I can easily see what I have stored in each of the containers. Note: I only hand wash them so I don't know how they hold up thru the dishwasher (they are super easy to wash though and have not stained at all), and I also don't put them in the microwave since due to my own personal preferences."
"These are the best storage containers I have ever bought and used. I have had them for six months and use them for everything. They don't stain. They don't break. The lids fit and are easily removable. The contents are visible. They stack in the pantry and take less space when stored. However, I rarely stack therm in my pantry because I use them all the time. I threw all my others storage containers in the trash. These are well worth the money."
"I've had a set of these for about 8 years and they work great. Some are starting to look a little worn after years of use, so grabbing another set, but love and highly recommend. The zero staining is the most impressive part of these but also really great that they are lightweight, stack well and won't break when (repeatedly) dropped. Five Stars!"
"This Tupperware is easy to open and close but stays closed when I need it, like when I put it in my husband's lunchbox. Despite using colored food in them, they haven't stained yet, which I like. They are said to be easy to clean but be prepared to have a brush and use its bristles to clean the inside crevice of the lid (where it locks onto the tub) because sometimes food gets in there. But yeah, works great and cleans well. Looks good, too."
"These are great and I think I have nearly every size they have. They are well worth the money and are of very good quality and seal very well. I am very pleased with this purchase. I have always loved the quality of a very quality brand I have used for years, but I find these of the same quality and at a cheaper price."
I have some very good containers that I've used in the past. The issue was that I would not know what was there and items would go to the back shelf and be lost in the infinite recycle bin. Being able to see what is in each container and At a glance Was very much worth the purchase price. The only issue I have is that taking them out of the dishwasher I do have to hand dry them in order to get them completely dry. These rubber made containers are well worth the price and very Convenient to have.
"I purchased these to upgrade my older rubbermaid containers that started to stain. I use these primarily for meal prepping and use hot sauce often... so, I really needed a container that did not stain and wasn't glass. These are it! They so far, have not stained while using Red Hot sauce. They wash up easy (including the lids) and they stack perfectly. I wish they had another lid color option to choose from (since I use them for meal prepping, and so does my husband, it'd be nice to have 2 different color lids so we can tell our meals apart)."
"Kids can‚Äôt break them like the Pyrex. The Tristan is nice and clear and spaghetti sauce, even reheating in the microwave, hasn‚Äôt stained them. The lids snap together and the container nest nicely. Huge space saver and no more hunting for that odd sized lid as most are interchangeable in this set. Truly thought these out from a real life perspective."
"Crystal clear dishwasher safe, stackable containers with stackable covers. for space saving. The covers have dark gray borders so they go with every style, and are easy on/easy off. It says microwave safe, but I do not put them in the microwave. They are excellent for transporting food in coolers for road trips and for storage in the fridge. They're so nice! I can't believe I'm so excited about storage containers, but it's a pandemic and well these things excite me now ;)"
"These storage containers are easy to use for all storage needs. We use them constantly, storing leftovers in the fridge and pantry items also. The square shape makes them very easy to store in the cupboard and space efficient in the fridge. Much more reasonably priced than Tupperware and lids are much easier too. I love that the lids stack and lock together, easy to store."
"These are my very favorite Rubbermaid storage containers. They are crystal clear so thing are easy to locate in the fridge and pantry. Best of all they do not stain if you put tomato based products in them, even if you microwave the container. This set stacks with the older sets that had the blue lids and works with those older lids as well. I purchased my older set at Costco years ago and was so happy that I found these because some of my older ones had cracked, they were over 10 years old."
"I've been using Rubbermaid Premier Containers for years. They are spill proof and even spaghetti sauce can be completely cleaned out of the container. Spaghetti sauce permanently stains other types of containers. The latest set I just bought says to use top dishwasher rack only, so I have to run the dishwasher a bit more often as I use many of these containers every single day. They look good, work great and clean up wonderfully! What's not to love?"
Had my other set for years and finally decided to replace them. Love the new stackable lids! Also the bowls are all the same shape and are stackable. Saves alot of room.
"I needed to replace my red Rubbermaid storage containers and wanted something neutral. I liked that these were really clear. So far they're still relatively clear, got a bit cloudy with washes. They hold my leftovers or salads great. I just wish they had more sizes. But no complaints."
"I really like the product. Great value for the price. I have another set of the purple ones that have held up nicely, but i needed to purchase more containers. The only issue I can see on these new ones is a slight bit of staining from use of turmeric. Other that, happy with my purchase and intend to purchase another set soon that includes the very large container. I highly recommend the product. It can handle the microwave, regardless of contents and the freezer."
I was sad to departure my old Rubbermaid containers. At first I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the lids but after a few use it wasn‚Äôt so bad. Love my new set. My old ones were similar to these set. Stain free. Even with curry sauce and tomato sauce. Various of sizes were plus !
"I ordered these a few years back and LOVE them. I live in Rwanda but when someone comes to visit, I usually pack a luggage for them to bring. Just ordered this set again, because I love them. Great sizes for a large family, and left over Sunday‚Äôs."
"These are my go to containers for putting up portions of everything from mixed fruits, and cut veggies, to portions of leftovers  They are handy, and given they can snap together, they are easy to handle and store. The material remains clear after many uses making it easy to see what's what in each of them.  Nice size assortment, and value"
"There's something so incredibly satisfying about replacing all your old, crusty food containers with shiny new ones -- literally, these are so shiny! I love the dark grey lids. This is my first time using the rubber lids, but I've quickly become a fan. They feel and look good and I was worried the lids in particular would take up a ton of extra space in my cabinet but they don't. Honestly, very happy with these and in a few months, I'll likely purchase a second set."
"I love this containers. They're stronger and don't stain easily. They do crack after several years. I bought my very first set at Walmart many years ago, and some of the containers started to crack on the bottom so I just bought a whole new set here on Amazon."
"This Rubber Maid is the only one I really like! These are the best, NEVER any spaghetti stains from using in microwave."
I loved this Rubbermaid creation of new meal prep bowls! Very durable and excellent quality!!! You get your money‚Äôs worth with this product.
"Love the clear hard plastic and the tops seal very well but, in about 3 years they do start to cloud up and crack around the bottom edges. They will stain with heavy tomato sauce or curries but still the best I have found for storing left overs, packing lunches and microwave use!"
I got a set of these at a one of the bulk item stores on sale and they were fantastic! I threw out all of my other plastic containers. Found this pack on Amazon and ordered immediately. The price for the set was really good as tupper ware seems to be pretty expensive. These don't stain and don't seem to hold any smells from the food kept in them. They clean easily and are dishwasher safe. Really recommend these to anyone that asks. Got a set for my mother and she loves them too.
"I really like this set. Sturdy, thick plastic and well fitting lids. Easy to clean in the dishwasher (top rack)."
I used to have a great set of Rubbermaid non stain bowls. I passed them on to my son. I have to admit the quality of the new Rubbermaid bowls is far less superior. I almost wish I had kept the set I purchased 12 years ago and just purchased new a new set for my son. Things cost more and are less superior products. It really is a shame.!
I ordered these to replace some I bought a few years ago. Repeated microwaving probably took its toll. I had a couple that had developed visible cracks. They did not leak though. They do not stain like their softer plastic cousins. They are very durable !
"These are the absolute best containers. The crystal clear containers make it easy to see the contents, don‚Äôt stain and are easy to clean. The updated lids for this Premier line of containers are much better than the previous lids. I have owned both types and can say that the updated lids create a much better seal. The containers with the updated lids also stack more securely."
I love these Rubbermaid containers but was finding it hard to get them locally. The stores in my area all went to the softer containers that stain and pit easily. The few hard plastic ones that they offered were very expensive. This is a nice set that includes the perfect variety of sizes at a reasonable price.
"I think these are the best quality Rubbermaid containers. A next assortment of sizes. I bought another type of Rubbermaid container that was cheaper, but the edges were sharp and the containers had plastic hanging off the edges... I returned those and bought these more expensive containers and like them."
"These Rubbermade containers are absolutely awesome! The method used for stacking them as well as the fit together lids make cabinet storage a breeze. No more misplaced lids, as they conform together beneath the stackable containers. For a tighter seal press down onto clear area on top of the lid. Eureka! I have found the best overall food storage containers!"
I've been looking for a large bundle of these and finally found them. They never stain or get that weird worn plastic etching that the regular Rubbermaid containers do
"They don't stain which is exactly what I was looking for. The lids are easy to put on, you just have to line them up and bend the side a little. They'll pop right on. Easy to clean and store. I love these."
"Wasn't planning on using these so much so soon but the holidays presented more of an opportunity for usage than I was expecting. Easily one of the top two food storage containers I've ever used, and if not the best then it's a very close second. Recommended."
I was looking for something in different sizes but not different shapes. I like that all the big ones the lid fit on all of them. I think is a good price for the quality of them. I use them q lot to take to work for me and my husband. The little ones are also great for kids to take to school. Feel free to put any liquid. Is truly leak proof. Pretty sure I‚Äôm going to get another set in the future.
High quality storage containers. Main reason for buying is the comparative lack of crevices for water to pool up in while using the dishwasher and remaining after dry cycle. Very little water if any compared to other plastic containers. I've also noticed that they do not stain as easy reheating food such as spaghetti sauce. Very satisfied with the product.
"I've used these for years. I needed to replace some of them because they'd developed cracks after all the hard use. I can highly recommend these storage containers. They keep everything fresh in my refrigerator, are easy to clean, and are quite durable. Wins all around."
I love these and they are definitely air right. Plan to buy a set as a gift for my daughter. I think this was a great purchase and time will tell. The look and price are great for the price. What I like is they don't look cheap and the containers are clear and don't have that cloudy cheap look.
"These bowls have the best design for storing food. The lids fit well but are easy enough to remove. Rubbermaid updated the lid style, but I prefer this original style much better. Bring it back, Rubbermaid!"
I love this brand and the way the black lids fit on the other ones seem to be too hard for me to get on and off plus I like the clear hard plastic over the milky plastic that they have great value for the money
"We have had to retire an older set that was starting to show it's wear and tear from microwave and dishwasher use, but knew that we wanted to stay with this brand. The variety of sizes in this set is perfect. The lids and bases stack easily so that our cabinet is always organized. I highly recommend these containers."
I have been using this particular style of Rubbermaid containers and was happy to find these large sizes. They were expensive though.
The seal is great and they don‚Äôt stain. The ‚Äúno stain‚Äù feature is why I purchased them. I also love that they are clear so I can see what is them. By by to the old style Rubbermaid storage containers.
"I bought these for their microwave use. Turns out they are not totally immune to microwaves. The sides have become distorted at the line of the food. It appears to be smudge, but the most diligent cleaning efforts indicate the marks are permanent."
The clear bodies are helpful when digging through leftovers in the freezer and I am immensely pleased that these DO NOT have the little useless eat to just vent clip like the red lid sets
This model is my favorite. Size and form is a hit. Previous containers served me for 4 years (of heavy usage üòÅ ) and I had to finally replace them. Hope Rubbermaid doesn't retire this model so that I can buy them again in 4 years üòä
The premium collection can be hard to find but outlast all others. Easy to stack and store. Easy to clean in dishwasher. I still have some from about 15-20 years ago.
"First and foremost, these cereal storage containers hold an entire Family sized cereal box!!! That in itself impressed me. The canisters aren't to big or bulky, so they don't take a ton of space. They stack on top of each other nicely as well! I also purchased two sets of the matching food storage containers (which I also highly recommend). These are easy to clean and the lids close firmly but also open at ease when you need to use them.. Definitely worth the cost to invest in these!"
"I bought this product and it was my fault for not paying attention and buying the smaller one. However, I absolutely loved! It doesn‚Äôt fit a whole cereal bag but I use for my kids snacks, and other items. I just bought the bigger container as well so that I can fit the whole family size bag from Costco. My pantry looks way more organized and foods stay fresh longer. I also bought their other containers set for things like sugar, brown sugar and pasta. I am thinking about buying more. They are perfect!  Edit: I am so disappointed! I bought this a couple of months ago and they are already broker. A few of them. I take really good care and I am not rough. My kids don‚Äôt have access to them either so I am the one opening and closing. I knew because of the price that wouldn‚Äôt last me forever but I am very disappointed that only last a couple of months."
"These containers perform as advertised. They are keeping my cereal fresher than leaving it in the cereal box. The only small flaw it that the tops flare out larger than the base, so they take up more room that they should on the shelf. You cannot store them touching each other - there has to be a gap of about an inch or so between them. When trying to organize, that's wasted space. (Again, I said it was a small flaw...I will live with it)"
I purchased this May 2021 because I was tired of cereal going to waste. I don‚Äôt eat cereal as often as I use too‚Ä¶which was part of the issue because after I got my cereal fix the rest would go bad due to going stale. This fixed my problem immediately. I kid you not. The same cereals placed in the containers May of 2021 are still good Feb of 2022. 10 month old cereal is good and fresh. That‚Äôs basically a year later. Unbelievable. Cereal is expensive‚Ä¶buy this now. You‚Äôll save money and your cereals in the long run!
"Like many others I was at first stumped at separating them. Then I flipped the stack upside down, hooked a lip on the wide edge on a flat ended doorknob. Pulled the inner ones down easily! Next lip, repeat, repeat! At 75 years old it was easy. With a bit of attention, the lids snap on nicely. Spout end away from the hand grip, push the bottom gently into one end of the cap, snap the clip on that end, then work across until all are locked. I will probably clean them by hand for a while. Perhaps later in the dishwasher if they get really dirty, but WITHOUT any final heat!"
"My daughter has been wanting to organize our pantry. We got these to store our cereal in. We have a real addiction to cereal! I like that these are see through. Easy to pick out what you want and finish it off. No more bags with half a bowl of stale cereal left in them! Plus fits most of our larger bags and family sized cereals. Things I don‚Äôt like: putting the lids on can be difficult. First time especially! Hack- push down the black rubber seal all around the outer edge before attempting to put lids on. Also, clip down short edges first! Second, we have a very small storage area/pantry. The way these are designed with lids and tapered tub, when placed side by side, there‚Äôs almost 2 inches on the shelf at the bottom between tubs! Lots of wasted space! We used to have easily 6 boxes Or more of cereal in the area we can only fit 4 of these. Lastly, depending on the Size of the cereal, it doesn‚Äôt always pour out easily. Overall, we like them. The stickers are cute. Just wish they had a better design and didn‚Äôt waste so much space."
"These work perfect for cereal. They are really hard to close the first time in order to get that seals squashed down. But they are definitely airtight. I put cereal in one container brand new out-of-the-box, and I didn‚Äôt eat it for at least a month. I tried that cereal today and it was a crunchy as if it was new. Depending on the shape and size of the cereal that you put in the container, it can be a little slow or difficult pouring out. To me, it‚Äôs not really a big deal."
"I love these. They are the perfect size. You can fit MOST cereal boxes in each one. Not meant for KING size boxes or bags, but will hold Family sized boxes. I only allow each kid to pick out one cereal at a time. So this keeps me from having 8 cereal boxes; and 4 half empty ones above my fridge."
I bought these because the larger containers designed for flour are to wide for me to comfortably grab off the shelf. These are very easy to grip. They're also very compact for how much they hold. They're easy to clean by hand but I threw them in the dishwasher. The gasket is easy to remove from the lid for rinsing. Make sure it's pressed all the way back down into the lid after drying. Handle end (as pictured) is about the width of the King Arthur logo. Someone in a previous review mentioned that if you tap the container on the table you can get all 5 pounds in. I prefer not to condense flour so I'm left with about a cup and a half that doesn't fit. Not a problem for me as I'm usually using about that much when opening the bag.
"I hate having a box, only to grab it and it is empty. Not only that, but rolling the plastic bag over and crunching it down, does not create a seal. This is taken care of with these containers. I didn't use the labels, but they are very handy. They are air tight, and feel extremely sturdy. If there was any complaint, is that large flaky cereal has a hard time being poured out. They get stuck sometimes. But other than that, I would buy again."
"These have been fantastic for cereal storage! We buy the same several cereals each week - so I just keep refilling them. They look nice - and keep the cereal fresh. They also come with stickers and a pen to write on. This is fulfilling all my OCD needs, haha. Also, these are a fraction of the price of similar items made by Tupperware. (I just went to an online party and saw these)"
"Anyone that has kids...sick of open cereal boxes all over? We were. This is the product for you. How about bags and bags (from a big box store) of goldfish? Yep. Put those little fish in here and they stay nicely organized and not to mention fresh. Possibilities for snacks are endless..pretzels, crackers, ect."
"Love them! The marker dries just like chalk! The lids weren‚Äôt quite lining up at first, but once I got it snapped shut it was perfectly fine. My ‚Äúred berries‚Äù Special K cereal does get clogged up when trying to pour. I had to keep tipping it back & forth. I haven‚Äôt tried my other cereals yet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure a smaller cereal would pour just fine! I would definitely buy more. Especially for the price!"
"I just received my storage container and they are perfect. I put brown sugar, white sugar, and confectioners sugar in mine and they are holding very well. They look so good in my pantry instead of those ugly bags of products so I would suggest buying these great storage containers are so airtight and look wonderful as well and you can't beat the price."
"My issue with these containers is the opening that you pour from. It is a circle so it doesn‚Äôt line up nicely with the edge of the container which causes cereal to not pour out smoothly and, even worse, cereal gets stuck inside the inner lip area and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get out. You can‚Äôt easily brush it back into the container because of the rubber seal. Also, when you get down to the bottom of a bag of cereal the last bit won‚Äôt come out of the container because the container is squared but the opening is a circle, so cereal gets trapped. The circle opening is also on the small side so you can‚Äôt reach in and grab a handful of cereal or snack."
I was looking for a container that I could empty my Costco bag of coffee beans into to keep them fresh. This was the perfect size and easy to grip too.
"This is perfect for keeping cereal in my pantry. They look clean and organized. They are easy to open and close, and keep an airtight seal. My kids love them, and we're excited to use them. You can easily see when you need to purchase more, without checking a cereal box."
"I used them to store different types of pasta rather than the boxes they come in. Each container stores 2 1/2 to 3 boxes of pasta, depending on the pasta. The containers seal tight and are easily poured out through the top. They are clear so you can see what is inside."
"Love these containers to keep cereal and crackers fresh longer, keeping potential ants away from sugars etc, and overall helped me organize my pantry. I would say leak proof overall, but had one incident with sugar‚Ä¶ granted it was a big sugar block I did not anticipate, still‚Ä¶."
Bought these for my son when he got his first place. He loves them and thanked me for getting them yesterday after several months of use. Helps him keep an eye on food levels so he knows what he has left. Helps him keep in budget!
"We are a cereal family. We Don‚Äôt care time of day! We have limited space in our kitchen, and find it very hard to put 3/4 boxes anywhere and it not look messy. These are filled and on top of my refrigerator. They are fantastic and look much better than just the boxes."
I ordered these for cereal my children never roll down the bag and we would always end up throwing it out but these have saved me so much money we haven't had stale cereal since we started using these I highly recommend especially for people with children
"I really liked this set. I had to add to the existing bigger set I had bought previously. While not the same brand, it blends well with the set, easy to use, to label, to clean. My younger children were able to easily open the pour spout and close it. Marker was better in this set."
"Snack bags usually tear in the wrong direction, leftovers items go stale or something heavier falls on the bag and crushes everything. I choose these containers to eliminate these problems. No snack goes stale, the containers are see through so I know what's left, their sturdy and stackable if space is in short supply plus they hold a bag of chips. Also the one end has a hand grip that makes handling the containers easy to deal with,"
"In used my containers to store rice, flour and pancake mix. I washed them before using so they were easy to clean. I didn‚Äôt think at the time to see if there were leak proof but they are certainly airtight and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important to me and I love them."
"The all in one, see thru, air tight, leak proof, easy to clean and easy grip. Also the name stickers are great, too. That's for my daughter's home, haven't got started on mine, yet. Will be ordering soon."
The amount of satisfaction and happiness I get with these is the same feeling of running through a wall when Shania says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go girls!‚Äù VERY airtight I put one on the wrong way and had to take it off and it took awhile. I cleaned them before too and it was a breeze also they are STURDY if I could have glass everything I would but these will do
"I absolutely love these. It‚Äôs helped my kids keep the pantry more organized and and I can see exactly how much cereal is left.  The only complaint I have is my Raisin Bran gets stuck in the hole and I have to shake it or use my fingers, all our other cereals come out perfectly"
These are sturdy they are big enough to fit a normal not family size of bag cereal. However these containers are air tight. Better than some brands I got from the big box storage. I will purchase again. My kids can use them with out working if to much is coming out. Great purchase!!! Use for anything!!
"I love these. I store all sorts of stuff. Oatmeal, coffee K-Cups, Salt to sprinkle when there‚Äôs ice out on the sidewalk even plastic bags. Great price point too."
"Heavy duty. Good airtight features. Tough to get pulled apart -I used dish liquid between them and they came apart. Lots of chalk labels and a very nice chalk ""pen"". Nicer than other chalk label products I have. I'd buy again."
"yes!!!! Right size and comparable with a highly competitive brand, these are just the ones I needed. I admit I didn't use the labels but I loved them. I'm just trying to find more to store or an excuse to buy some more..."
used to store lentils and dry goods works great love these thick good quality not thin and poor great quality for many things just not wet
"I really like the containers. The only thing I had problems with was separating the containers, ones got them out of the box."
"my husband loves his Cereal, and he would get so upset that it would go stale in the bag, so I decided to get these a try, and so far they have kept him very happy. We are very pleased with this item, and will be purchasing more in the future."
"They work fine for the purpose of storing the cereal, it was a good buy excelente product, good quality, good investment."
I have to say that I really like the container. It is easy to use and clean. It keeps my cereal and my cookies fresh. There is no spill out and the conveniently top is great for pour out the cereal without mess.
"They are easy to hold, easy to open, easy to fill and fit just about anywhere I need them. I will probably be ordering more in different sizes, I absolutely love this set! Even easy for someone to use with one hand, my husband had shoulder replacement and is limited on one side."
"I bought these to store my cereal in and make for easy access for my kiddos. I think they look nice and look as described. A few of the lids don‚Äôt snap 100% as well as they should, however it keeps it airtight."
I really think you get a great product for your money. However I wish the plastic was clearer but I guess you get what you pay for.
Sturdy material
These fit perfectly on my shelves and keep food airtight. They pour great and hold a good amount.
"I purchased these to store bulk hard candies for my office staff. These containers are well made with good seals. Overall, a great value for the price."
These are great. Keep cereal fresh a lot longer than what we would get just in their original box. Really like them and look great.
Smaller than I thought. But they fit about 3/4th of the big bags of cereal. They give you different options for the chalk board stickers. And come with a lifetime warranty. But they're very nice.
These containers are exactly what I needed for storing cereal because of the many children in my house. They store airtight and I can see the ingredients inside.
I ordered these to help store baking supplies and they are wonderful!!! The stickers and chalk pen are an added bonus to the functionality of these containers. They are perfect to leave on the counter without looking messy and easy to store.
These were the perfect size for what I wanted. Easy to use and they have a very tight seal
"I buy healthy cereal in bulk in order to save on the cost. Often the best prices for bulk cereal come in bags vs. boxes, so these offer are a great way to keep the cereal fresh."
Love them look great in pantry and they are airtight for sure ! I bought 2 sets! No more waisting in my house lol!
Keeps cereal fresh and not stale. Perfect size for the smaller boxes of cereal you buy in the 10-14 Oz.
"I store my brown & white rice + quinoa, millet and barley. These are the grains that I use when making food for my dogs. No need to use clips to close the plastic bags. Like the indented area which makes for easy handling."
Clear plastic cereal containers. Each container can hold a bag of cereal.
"The product is exactly what I was looking for, however on one container, the ""ridge"" that locks the top in place was broke. So I cannot lock the top in place near the front opening. Disappointed, and I'll try to find another use for it, but I wouldn't be able to store food in it. It would go stale."
I love these containers so much they are a very good size and they look so pretty
"Easy to.clean, keeps cereal fresh and makes everything look organized"
I ordered two sets of 4 I liked them so much and very cost effective too !
Kids say the pour hole is too small but I think it‚Äôs a plus maybe they won‚Äôt wait and get a smaller amount instead of being greedy ü§£ü§£ otherwise great product No complaints here
"I bought these to store cereal in my pantry in a much neater fashion, and they are perfect for that purpose! They are air-tight and keep the cereal fresh. They look great too."
These. Are great for cereals or pasta or flower and sugar.
Love these for cereal no it don't go bad because the grand kids leave the bag or box open
"Living in FL, cereal and other opened items go stale quickly. These containers have kept the cereal and food fresh. GOOD SEAL"
"Using these for my flour storage. So far, they work as expected."
"I would buy these again, they have secure lids, came packaged nicely really love these"
I use them to put my 10lb bag of dry cat food in for better storage. Ergonomic and easy pour.
"Just as it looks, sturdy very well sealed for containers."
I wanted to thank Vtopmart for their fantastic customer service as the black set I received was unfortunately damaged in shipping. I have since ordered the multicolor set and no damage was found so I know it was a complete accident. They do right by their customers and for us they replaced the broken set. I truly appreciate their responsiveness and kindness and love their products as well!
Very nice containers they are much nicer than I expected
They are airtight for sure. But very hard to get lids on. Omg. I wanted to scream so did my hubby!!!!!!!
These work great for cereal storage!! Bought a variety of sizes to accommodate other baking supplies!
"Hi! I am still completing the ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list for my first apartment. So when Tupperware came up, I looked for an affordable option with a high quantity.  This container set is for sure, a step up from your regular Tupperware containers with the red top you would buy at the grocery store.  I was very satisfied with the quantity of each container, and the variety of sizes. Also, the lids are excellent. You can clamp each lid around the container, that pulls the lid closed and between the container and the lid, a rubber and air tight seal. The clamps close and re open very easily.  I would expect that any human being should be able to operate these storage containers, perhaps except for the extremely young or extremely old.  I can honestly say that my life has greatly improved since the purchase of these storage containers.  Thank you!"
"Best Food Storage Containers on Amazon ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ This is a great set of containers. These containers are basically indistinguishable from Tupperware or other brand name containers, both in quality and features. I also like that they're microwave, and freezer safe. There are so many that you will always have the right size for whatever you need. If you stack them the right way they don't even take up much space in your cabinets! I am also really happy with the quality and durability of these containers, the plastic feels much sturdier than any other plastic food containers that I have used in the past. The locking lids are a fantastic feature too. They lock down tight guaranteeing that you won't have any leaks or spills. Clean up is a snap too. Just toss them in the top rack of your dishwasher and you're good to go. The package also included 16 chalkboard labels, a marker and a personal letter from the owner of the company reassuring that customers can contact him if any problem arises, which I felt was a nice touch. I'm super happy with this purchase & I would highly recommend these to anyone!"
"This is another set of containers with similar style of snap lids, just different manufacturer. (I don't think the other manufacturer has round containers in their group options. And something tells me that they are better--maybe because they are more expensive but they seem thicker. Still, the ones I'm reviewing are very good). The lids have to be aligned to the base--a little experience is all you need. The simple conventional lids are always iffy--some snap, others don't. I'm now sold on these kinds of lids. The plastic too seems more durable and sturdy than the conventional kind of containers, but I have not had them for too long. There are two reasons why these lids work better. They have a solid snap mechanism. And, they have a rubber ring embedded in the edge. The only thing is, you cannot put the lids in the microwave--and I suspect this is because of the rubber. But the rubber in the case of this manufacturer (unlike my other containers) comes off easily. So if I want to micro, I'll just remove the rubber ring first. Also, because of the rubber ring, I don't put the lids in the washer. Again, the rubber rings can be removed if you must put them in the dishwasher. When I wash the lids by hand, water remains embedded under the rubber ring--so I sometimes remove it and wipe it dry. Otherwise, I'm afraid the water will gather mold.  So far, I have not microwaved these containers. I use them more for storage--snacks (chips, cookies, etc.) and dry foods (legumes, rice, etc.), and vegetables in the refrigerator. I feel very neat and clean now! Instead of storing the foods in their own plastic bags. I do use them for lunch but I don't have a microwave at work. And so far I have not stored any cooked food in the refrigerator because I mostly eat freshly prepared foods.  Good luck! I would buy these."
I have to say pretty much every product I have bought from this company has been in extremely good condition and value for money. I‚Äôm glad the quality has stayed consistent and so has the price! I can‚Äôt complain.
Absoluty love it. Really nice and heavy built. Seals down to the dot and doesnt leak at all. Cleans easily in a washer too! A MUST HAVE for all left overs or carry on meals.
"Received these and they are smaller than what was stated on the description. Also, some of the lids don‚Äôt stay latched on one side. Using these for food storage, having it air tight is pretty important. I‚Äôve emailed the seller as the paper said and have heard no response. I‚Äôm a huge amazon fan and never have any problems with returning or fixing things that aren‚Äôt as described. However, this seller is disappointing. I would not recommend this product. Looks like I will be emptying the food I did transfer from cardboard boxes into baggies until I can get better containers. (Not a fun task and a bit of an inconvenience seeing that it‚Äôs pancake mix, flax seed, and potato flakes...)"
"Love these storage units. I have purchased 3 separate sets. I am so organized now -- makes baking as easy as can be. The large variety in sizes makes it so easy to keep things organized in pantry, cabinets and refrigerator."
I love it so much ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
"This airtight food storage container set is an incredible buy. I love it! It is airtight to keep things fresh inside. The lids snap into place with ease, no problems.  I‚Äôve recently gone through my entire kitchen and between this and a few other sets of various sizes, I have moved nearly all I have into airtight containers. That includes things in the refrigerator, too. Vegetables get cleaned and put into containers in the fridge. It was hard to keep shelves and cupboards clean with kids in the house, but with these there is almost no mess to be made. It is easier to find things, too. The clean shelves give me peace of mind. Also, these are clear so it is obvious when I am running low on something - and much easier to make a grocery list.  The sizes in this particular container set are incredibly useful and I would definitely buy it again if I have need for more. It was a good value"
I love these! I‚Äôm not one who cleans my fridge weekly or does those tik tok videos that i love watching but these made me feel fancy and clean. They look so organized in the fridge and I store my son‚Äôs homemade baby food in them and I haven‚Äôt personally tipped the thing over to see if it would spill or leak but I have grabbed it and some went to the sides of the lid and nothing came out so I assume it doesn‚Äôt leak but I‚Äôm not willing to try lol.
"Received these storage containers today, they are exactly as described. Perfect sized with locking lids. After reading some of the reviews regarding the lids not locking properly, I checked each container and lid. I am happy to report they all fit and lock perfectly. The company clearly advises upfront in writing against putting the lids in the dishwasher. These containers nest inside each other which is a great space saving feature. They are made of really good thick quality plastic and are durable. I am really happy with these containers and lids and recommend them. I plan on buying more!"
Really useful and quality product from Chef‚Äôs Path. The seller is very professional and customer centric. I‚Äôd highly recommend buying this
I know that food containers come a dime a dozen these days but I really like this set. It's got these med sized squares (550mL) that are the perfect size for so many things. And the circular ones are amazing to hold portions of melons and fruit. They feel like they are leak proof but I haven't tested it yet. I haven't had any leaks from liquids that have been in them yet but they've also been stored on flat surfaces. The plastic feels much more sturdy than the Rubbermaid brands and cleans up much easier. I'm completely happy my purchase and would buy these again
"I was looking for some lightweight, leakproof, dishwasher-safe, BPA-free containers that I could use to store leftovers and to bring lunch to work. The variety of sizes in this 16-pack was exactly what I needed. The containers themselves are just-as described and the lids lock down firmly. I haven't had any leaks (or any worries), and I haven't had any issues with locking down the lids. You know how some containers get a little warped or weird when you run them through the dishwasher, which makes it hard to put them on your containers later? Yeah, I have not run into that issue with these. I have previously spent a lot of money on many different food storage containers sets and I am finally happy to say that these food storage containers are worth your money. Very happy with the purchase. üòÉ"
"I‚Äôm going to buy this again!! Love their 12 ounce containers I wish I could buy them separately, can‚Äôt find them separately. I like them all, so will buy again. I can find 12 ounce containers, but they‚Äôre too high to put in a lunch box, these are perfect!"
"What the hell? These are horrible. Tiny as hell. How can all the food fit in the photos in these? A slice of pizza can probably barely fit in the largest one. I paid extra for the size variety as a household investment. The lid quality seems great but that does nothing for these tiny, typical Tupperware size you get from the dollar store or target. I cant believe it. The entire set is in this photo. All 16. This was a massive dupe. I was looking forward to these all week- thought it would solve me & my husband's salad shaking and fresh veggie leftovers dilemma. A tomato or brocolli stalk or onion cant even fit in these- not high/deep enough. Boo. Shame on you for tricking us! I was going to invest in the other line products. Now I refuse."
"All the units seal airtight and work as they are advertised. Additionally, the lids don't split like many do on other products. (Very pleased with that attribute) The only drawback is like other plastics in that tomato-based products will stain the plastic."
"I was contacted by the Chef's Path before the product even arrived. They wanted to be sure I was pleased with my purchase. That's the kind of responsiveness I look for when shopping online. I've bought hundreds of storage containers over the years yet not one has lasted more than 6-12 months, at most. These are much nicer than any of the others. They are clear, wash up with little effort, and lock tight. They came packaged with care and extra touches that are hard to find. They even included a white chalkboard marker to use with the labels. I am already planning to streamline my pantry with more from Chef's Path. You can't go wrong with these!"
I purchased these for my college freshman daughter & her roommate. Their dorm kitchen was remodeled and needed storage food containers. They absolutely love the containers. It was a true set as the description stated. Hopefully this will teach them out to cook more. Lol.
"I really like the amount and different sizes, always struggle with that as I use them for a variety of things. The lids are very durable and leak proof. So far nothing has leaked out of any of them and I do lunches for hubby and kids. The locks are a bit tough at first to open and lock but overall do the job on keeping things sealed. I have put them in the microwave and so far i have had no problems, like staining or pealing. The only thing I didn't like was the lids are hard to clean especially when food is not rinsed properly."
"These containers are great. We were expecting the run of the mill plastic containers you find in the big box stores but were pleasantly surprised. The quality is outstanding. very durable, tight sealing. The chalk board stickers and included pen were a pleasant surprise. No more guessing what is in the container or how long it has been in storage. These containers are well worth the price."
"Excellent product! When I received my shipment there was a broken container. I immediately contacted the email address proved inside the box and received a replacement within a few days. The best part about these containers is they DO NOT STAIN! I use a lot of red sauces and not a single stain yet, it washes right out.. I've not had a single spill with the lid on. They are also very sturdy containers. I can't comment on how they are when you microwave them as I don't heat food up in plastic. I absolutely LOVE the labels and chalkboard markers thay come with it. Can't say enough good things about this product.  Rebekah"
"BEYOND THRILLED to finally have a container that holds in the liquidy, mushed baby food. The others push on but there's always something that escapes. The clasps on all sides and the rubber seal guarantee everything stays in. Also, for the little ones - a great play thing that they can't open so no concerns of breaking into the baby bag and opening up the food containers. Additionally, baby or not, these are amazing storage containers and all the sizes are ideal. Also, GREAT customer service!"
"I really like that you can see clearly what's in them, no more guessing, no more magic markers to identify what's in them. They do nest together, just don't press them down or they're hard to separate. I can't think of anything about them I don't like, but I've only had them a short time, if something changes I'll re-review"
"So far, I am very happy with this purchase. They seal completely. Easy to lock and unlock. I‚Äôve used others where after some use/washing the lids didn‚Äôt fit the bases, but so far, these have been flawless in use and execution. Based on this experience, i will consider buying some additional sizes from this seller."
"These are great containers. For me, the sizes in the set and number of each is extremely useful. I love that they are see-through. Time will tell but the containers are so sturdy that I think they will hold up if the instructions for use and cleaning are followed. Really do stack into a compact space."
"Did not want glass but wanted to be able to freeze ,microwave and put hot food in . These let you do all .Plus the price is very good . Customer service is right on top of things , they do not leave you waiting for days to get questions answered. . So yes I recommend both the company and their products."
"Love, love, love these plastic containers. Loved the look, the style and, best of all, they all fitted perfectly. Came with a nice note from the manufacturer regarding NOT to put the lids in the microwave etc. Also, a nice surprise, was labels with a removable marking pen for storage items. I will use them for everyday left overs etc. but wanted to say, thank to the manufacturer for making such quality plastic wear."
These are literally the most durable storage containers I‚Äôve ever owned! I‚Äôm sold on all the collections now! I‚Äôm going to buy them all. They have a thick rubber seal so they don‚Äôt leak. These things are so nice and so thick. They are perfect. I 10/10 recommend. They also came with labels and a white chalk marker for free. Super nice all around.
I bought these to replace some of our cheap ones and I am very happy with them! The lids fit very well and we haven't had any issues with leaks so far! They clean very easily (even used some with spaghetti and no stains) I like that they are dishwasher safe.. I just have to remind my husband not to use the lid in the microwave! Great buy üòä
"This is my second order of this set. I have found so many uses for it. Even small amounts of things like crackers, nuts, cereal and many others that get stale if left in the bag to the end are kept air tight and fresh 'til the end. Good choice of sizes for leftovers whether small or large and larger size is perfect for my slow cooker meals that I freeze for later consumption and always in excellent consistency even weeks later."
"Love the durability of these. They‚Äôre dishwasher safe, clear instructions for care & feel very durable! They snap great. I tend to lean towards glass nowadays for storage but these are actually good quality so I‚Äôm excited. Best part? Ordered around 3-4pm and they arrived same day at 5pm! Thank you!"
"I ordered the 16 piece set. These containers are sturdy, airtight and attractive. Unlike other storage containers, these are clear, making it easy to see what is inside. The lids snap on all four sides, ensuring they are properly closed and a tight fit, yet easy to open. It's been just a week and I just ordered the 14 piece set which has containers for cereal, pasta, etc. In addition, i was contacted by the owner to find out if I was satisfied. This is rare! I'm really impressed with this company and its products."
This product is great for a starter pack of food storage. I ended up ordering a different set of bigger containers for large amounts of left overs which is what I actually needed. But keeping this product because I do like the way it is made and quality.
"So glad I ordered these! They are plastic but durable and leakproof. The lids are easy to latch and unlatch. I never microwave plastic, but the manufacturers use guide states ‚Äúdo not microwave the lid‚Äù. I wish more chalkboard stickers were included but other than that these will help organize my food storage!"
The containers appear to be very sturdy and well-made but they are so small I am not able to use them in my pantry. The picture is very deceiving. I ended up giving them to my grandchildren to use in their play kitchen. They lock like they are a good size in the picture but in reality are much too small to be of any use in a pantry. The picture is very deceiving
"Purchased these for my mom she absolutely loves them! Food last longer, no more leaks and best of all you can put them in the dishwasher! I purchased those approximately 6 months ago, now she wants some bigger! Yes that was a hint, now I‚Äôm happy to look in our cupboards and see all those cheap mismatched have no idea where the lids are at gone...... you will not regret this purchase!"
They are slightly smaller than I thought but perfect for organizing craft supplies - I don‚Äôt need to worry about anything falling out - even the smallest beads.  The only reason I say they are smaller is bc I am bad at measurements... they are as described. Will add photos later.
"Perfect for all my needs, don‚Äôt leak and can put in refrigerator , freezer, dishwasher and microwave. And great size to put away leftovers, fruit and vegetables, airtight so help stay fresh longer."
"I live in a very old Senior Housing building that is rife with bugs...couldn't stand going into my pantry. Decided to change and put all non canned goods in these. I ordered 3 different sets. I REALLY like all of them. They close securely, are stackable (mostly), are easy to label with chalk labels and marker. The company includes coupons for future purchases. I just wish I could buy multiples of particular sizes instead of only different sized sets. Overall, just exactly what I needed at a good price point."
"Bought two sets for myself and 4 for Christmas gifts. These are well made, easily stackable containers that keep food fresh longer in the refrigerator. these are a great size for leftovers. They are well made and clean easily. My only concern is if you store and heat anything with a red sauce in these you should immediately wash or rinse to keep them from staining. So far none have stained."
"I bought these containers mainly for our toddler so that he can open the lid by himself. It is an instant success and we use them every single day! I also appreciate the variety of sizes since we not only store our kid's snacks but also remains of our everyday meals. After a few days of use, one of the containers had a crack in it. I was not exactly sure how it happened but when I contacted the owner about it, he was very generous and immediately sent a replacement, no questions asked. So far none of the other containers have been damaged so I do not doubt the quality of the product. One thing I would like improvement on is the non-microwavable lid. It would be super convenient if we can use the lid in the microwave. There are many container brands (including big name brands) but if you want a good balance of quality, service and supporting a small family business, I recommend Chef's Path!"
These are great for storing food to travel with such to work or a picnic. They don't leak. I use the lids in the microwave despite the seller's remark not to. I'm buying another set in 2020.
"Given that I have bought some awful storage containers in the past for daily use. I must say this set has far exceeded my desire. I love them. The seals have remained intact and have not experienced any leaking, nor has there been a cracking issue so far. I would recommend this item."
They are stackable. I love them. I started using them right away. I wish I could figure out how to store the lids so they are safe from getting 'lost' I hate it when the storage containers get lost. But they are nice I like them and hope you get some. There is no LARGE in them however the provide coupons for larger ones at a discount
"The lid isn‚Äôt microwaveable, so certain foods may not be good for reheating soup for example. They do tend to stain easily but most Tupperware will when it comes to certain food. I love that they are leakproof because my fianc√© carries them in a bag when taking to work!"
I love these! These are such an upgrade from my previous lunch meat containers I've been saving for the past 3 years. Don't judge! I'm sure there's more of you out there. These look great for organization purposes and serve as cgreat food storgage!
I LOVE THESE CONTAINERS!!  * STACKABLE IN DRAWERS * CLEAR FOR VISIBILITY IN THE REFRIGERATOR * FULL SEAL * MICROWAVE/TOP SHELF DISHWASHER  BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 'TREAT' : THREW OUT ALL OLD STAINED AND OVER-USED CONTAINERS AND STARTED FRESH WITH THESE ATTRACTIVE AND USEFUL SETS
"I like the containers, they are very airtight and made very well. Thick not thin plastic. I have washed them several times in the dishwasher and they hold up well. I put the lids on the top rack and have not used the lids in the microwave as the instructions said. Overall a great purchase for the money!"
"These are just great! I have been using them for almost a week and they are easy to clean, durable, and don't leak. I actively tried to spill pineapple juice and couldn't! The chalkboard labels are great! They make storing and organizing a breeze! They are a real bargain for the price. I saw reviews that said they were smaller than pictured and I did not find that to be true, and they are true to described size. I have already wish listed several more sets."
"Just got these in. They seem good. Will do an update if I feel they are not worthy of 5 stars while explaining why I did the update. Below are the actual sizes for all who were wondering. 12oz: 4.5""x4.5""x2.5""tall (4 total) 19oz: 5.25""x5.25""x2.5""tall (3 total) 25oz (round): 6""x2.75""tall (3 total) 30oz: 6.85""x5.25""x2.75"" tall (3 total) 35oz: 8""x5.25""x2.75"" tall (3 total) All measurements were with the lids on and at it's widest points."
Love the little chalkboard labels that come with it! Such a nice touch! But definitely some of the most durable best Tupperware and doesn't stain like the other Tupperware does !
"This product is perfect for anyone. With such versatile functionality it can be used for food, objects, kids‚Äô toys, anything! When I first ordered this product, there were a couple containers that got damaged (probably during shipping) and I contacted the seller. He was such a pleasure to speak to and went above and beyond to ensure I got an amazing product and very quickly! I definitely recommend supporting this family owned company!"
Glad I ordered these! Perfect sizes to pack a nutritional meal. No leaks and I'm very grateful for that! It's nice to be confident that everything stays neat and tidy. Delivered on time and packaged very nicely.
"I have been using them for a week and so far no spills and do well in dishwasher both lid and bottom...haven‚Äôt used in microwave yet! They are stackable and durable...I dropped one with soup in it, out today the fridge onto the floor no spillage."
"This is the 4th purchase I‚Äôve made from Chef‚Äôs Path, and each set of containers has been excellent. I purchased this set of smaller containers to use in lunches. They are the perfect size and the lids fit with no leaks. They are also microwave safe."
These are a great value. Top notch product. I only gave them a qualified rating on durability because I ave only had them a short time. They are so useful to us because my husband and I are older( I‚Äôm 80) . I don‚Äôt want to cook every day it I don‚Äôt want to waste food . I can batch cook and freeze individual meals using these container.
they are smaller than what i expected but all in all seem to be good have only had them for a bit. i put in dishwasher and that is easy enough....seem to be very durable...don't know if leak proof i have not put liquid in any of them yet.
"These are great and exactly as they say they are. I didn‚Äôt look at the sizes, so I was surprised when they were smaller than I hoped. But that‚Äôs totally my fault. I like them so much I‚Äôm keeping these, and hoping they carry them in a larger size! Off to search now! üôåüèº"
"When I first looked at them, I was hesitant. They seem small and flimsy. So happy to be wrong! Although small in size, they work great for all my leftovers and hold more than I imagined. As long as you have a few other extra large containers on hand, this set will not only save you tons of storage space, but will be so practical in the day to day. Sturdy and leak proof as well. Love them."
"I dont usually write reviews, but I really liked how much effort they put in. Instead of just throwing in the containers, they made sure it was put in a way to not damage them and to ensure sanitation. It comes with a marker and stickers for the containers. And a note. And also discounts! I like the containers. They are sturdy and not flimsy, cheap plastic."
"These storage containers are awesome. We had one issue with one of the lids closing, but I reached out to customer service and they quickly replied with pictures telling me how to resolve this issue. Highly recommend these containers! We just ordered the cereal containers and hope to love them as much."
"Stackable and airtight, ready to wash in dishwasher. Just don't put the lid in the microwave. He had it sealed and it popped off."
This is my second bundle that I'm buying and they are just as good as before! I've been using them to make meals ahead of time for the week and putting snacks and cereal in and the food stays fresh and does not spill out. I highly recommend these!!!
"S√∫per herm√©ticas. La comida se mantiene muy bien ya que cierran perfectamente. Los tama√±os son ideales, perfecto para organizar en el refri"
"Nice containers a bit small wish they had bigger sizes, my fridge look nice and clean"
"Easy to clean would have been a 5 star; however, I don't know of a plastic product that you can clean tomato sauce stains out of completely. They do go through the dishwasher nicely."
"I bought these for storing food in my cooler while traveling/camping. I tested them with water inside and so far they do not leak, which was the most important factor for me. I will update my review later if I experience any issues with durability over time."
This is a nice set and stacks up pretty well. Nice air proof and love them when preparing tacos ahead of time so all your toppings are ready to roll. Perfect size not too big but still fits plenty. Wish I had one larger one for the rare occasion. Definitely recommend.
When I went searching for a container set to replace my current set for meal prepping I didn't imagine I would come across a product with such amazing durability. These containers meet all my meal prepping needs and they are easy to use. My family really appreciates how the lids lock onto the containers providing a spill proof container for our 1 year old . The containers are thick and sturdy and easy to clean. With so many different sizes it allows me to create more meals and snacks during meal prep. 10/10 would get again and who doesn't love a company that reaches out personally to make sure you are happy with your purchase and offer to help address problems and concerns if they arise.
"These containers are an organizer-freak‚Äôs dream. There are 24 containers, all plastic, rectangle, 4 different sizes but the lids are all the same size - which is so nice!  Being plastic means they won‚Äôt break easily and they‚Äôre not too heavy and don‚Äôt overweigh my shelving in my apartment pantry.  I loved the chalk stickers and how easy it was to write and erase on them.  It was a bit difficult to get the tops on at first, and a few of the containers were stuck together when I took them out of the box. But thankfully, my husband was able to fix that! The tops get easier too.  10/10 recommend if you‚Äôre crazy about being organized! Can‚Äôt beat the price for the amount you get."

"Economical, seem to be pretty sturdy. Disappointed because the do not look like the picture and in the description they say they are CLEAR! As you can see they are not."
"Love these containers more than I thought I would. Great quality, clean and organized look. The lids are all the same size so that's a great thing. No having to search for matching container/lid combo."
"My 17yr son is, probably, a bit on the OCD side of organization and desperately wanted a ""tiktok"" kitchen...basically an obsessively organized kitchen. He threw what he wanted in the cart and mommy slipped the bank card. I was super impressed with these, in particular. The are air tight, not too bad to look at, sturdy or stable or whatever you want to call it, and all the different sizes are perfect for organizing a pantry! I am buying a second set for my oldest who just bought her first house!"
""
"The lids fit all containers, and that delights my hubby. He hates searching through lids to find the right one. I liked them so much, I bought two more sets from this company. They stack nicely, and the range of sizes works perfectly. I appreciate how well they are packed for shipping, nothing is broken or stuck together. We understand the snugness from the bags is necessary to keep the plastic from bonding to each other. A great value,and I recommend."
"When we moved into this house, I was so concerned about our tiny pantry since our previous pantry was almost twice the size. Finding items and storing items was a challenge. I purchased 3 items to fix the problem: a can rack, an over the door shelf system, and these storage bins. Hands down the best purchase for immediate relief of the chaos in our tiny pantry were these storage bins!!!! #1 - They are transparent so you see what you have. #2 - They are stackable and equal in width. #3- They come with labels. You may not fully understand how much space product packaging takes up in your pantry until you get rid of it. After my first day organizing our pantry, I had a whole row with almost nothing on it. I plan to buy more of these containers in the future after figuring the sizes I will need."
"This airtight food storage container set is an incredible buy. I love it! It is airtight to keep things fresh inside. The lids snap into place. A few had a tight fit at first, but overall it was all good.  I‚Äôve recently gone through my entire kitchen and between this and a few other sets of various sizes, I have moved nearly all I have into these stackable containers. That includes things in the refrigerator, too. It was hard to keep shelves and cupboards clean with kids in the house, but with these there is almost no mess to be made. It is easier to find things, too. The clean shelves give me peace of mind. Also, these are clear so it is obvious when I am running low on something - and much easier to make a grocery list.  The sizes of this particular set were really useful and I would definitely buy it again if I have need for more. It was a good value."
"These are very sturdy, inexpensive and clear enough to see what‚Äôs in them. They come with labels so you can see what you have. Lids fit nice and tight. I wasn‚Äôt able to use all the tall ones as we don‚Äôt eat cereal or a lot of pasta but I‚Äôm sure I can find another use for them. I‚Äôm quite satisfied with my purchase."
"I purchased this set with the idea of getting my pantry in order. What I wasn't expecting was the number of containers, the quality and durability of same.  The lids fit tight, so if you have dexterity issues, be advised. The snaps are tight, not snug.  The entire set were easily cleaned and I had no difficulty in separating them prior to handwashing the entire set.  If you are looking for a durable set that can be used anywhere in the home (I have some in the bathroom) it is worth checking these out."
"I completely reorganized my pantry & I am in love with how it turned out, these containers helped me save so much space. I bought these & another set (from the same store) with larger containers so I could get everything organized & it turned out beautifully. The containers all showed up in perfect condition, I was worried because some of the reviews said they had cracked our broken containers but I had no issues with any of mine, they did come with the labels & marker but I chose not to use them. The containers seem to be of good quality too, they seem sturdy & airtight, they are a little oddly shaped in my opinion but I don‚Äôt mind that much. Overall, very pleased with my purchase & thrilled with how my pantry looks now!"
"I needed help in my pantry and these containers have made it look so much better in there. Everything is so much more organized than before. They have labels that you can write what is on each one. The lids have an awesome seal to them. I store my chips in them and I have not had to throw out any due to them getting stale. I was afraid there would be a smell, but they are great! I do want to get another set in the future."
"Love these containers for our pantry. I know people have complain that they aren‚Äôt truly clear, but that doesn‚Äôt really bother me. They are clear enough to see what‚Äôs inside. I prefer having sturdy containers for flours, sugars and other baking ingredients over trying to scoop out of the bag, and it keeps the ingredients fresher longer. My only concern is that the lid locks feel a little flimsy. I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to evaluate if they will break off, but so far these are great and the price was better than many others I looked at."

I was having problems with little weevils getting in pasta and rice. These are airtight and I think they were a great value for the amount. They are not as clear as shown in the photo though.
I love them but they came broken so I got in contact with the manufacture to see if they can replace them so we will see!!! So update I contacted the company and they resolved my issue and I love this storage containers they fit perfectly in my pantry and now have so much more space in my pantry I love them and I also like that they can be flipped upside down for more room!!!!
"Very sturdy and easy to clean. You can easily take out the rubber seal and clean it, also Very easy to reinstall. As for the container themselves I'm very happy. The labels are nice but the pen for writing leave something to be desired and to me they are a bonus anyway so no harm no foul. I may buy more and they are great for gifts."
If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs easy to clean and uniformed looking this is it. They aren‚Äôt 100% crystal clear but they aren‚Äôt cloudy. They are airtight and hold on liquid also. I use one of them to store my beans In the fridge for the week and it doesn‚Äôt leak. The rubber seal comes off the lid for cleaning also. When you first get them they are a little tough to get them apart but with a little common sense and using the paper between them they slide out with no struggle needed.
"These are perfect and have helped my organize my pantry area so much better than it was! No, they are not as clear as in the photos, but I honestly don't even notice, I'm so happy with the organization and being able to see everything that I have now! Highly recommend! Only wish there were more smaller ones in the set, but I'll likely be ordering more anyway!!!"
This is an update to my review yesterday. I love the products and I'm very satisfied. It make my cabinets more rooms and organized. When I received my ordered yesterday I'm very excited but the exciment turn into disappointment when I found out that one of the files of the containers are all damaged. So I chat with their costume service regardings the problems and they very helpful. I was so amazed how fast they send the replacement. They send me another sets of the containers within 24 hours. They make my day completed. So excited to finishing my organization. Great products with excellent costumer service. It's worth it! Definitely recommend it to my family and friends. Thank you so much for the immediate action. I loved it!
"You‚Äôll love these. They‚Äôre sturdy, great sizes, & of extreme importance to me - the closing mechanism on the tops of these are superior because they close completely, you listen for the click as each side closes, & you know your product inside is protected & airtight. An organized pantry is such a beautiful thing!"
"These made my baking cabinet look like a dream! They all have the same size lid which makes them so easy to fill. I love the labels but I used a paint marker instead of the provided chalk marker, which I found to be too light. I had a smaller set of the pricier containers but they are honestly too heavy to move in and out of the cabinet all the time. These are sturdy but lightweight at the same time. They have a nice airtight seal. I‚Äôm thrilled with this purchase! Really satisfied my need for getting my life together, one cabinet at a time."
I got mine delivered today and put them to use tonight! I absolutely love them! It was so satisfying to organize my pantry! Although there were 4 of them that were chipped. Nothing major. Just around the outside rim. No cracks or anything that would let air in. Kinda sucks for the price but you can‚Äôt really notice. I will definitely be buying more!ü§û
"These are great for storing food items such as dry pasta, brown sugar, etc. They seal air tight and come with labels you can apply. My only complaint is the containers are dishwasher safe but because of rubber seal the lids have to be hand washed. I would purchase these again."
"Definitely hard to get apart, I just ran hot water on the side for less than a minute. That way the inside of the containers don't get wet. Not as big as I thought they would be but great for snack boxes sizes and the smallest ones are good for nuts, raisins etc"
"I purchased the 24 piece set Saturday got them on Sunday and organized the pantry. They are easy to use perfect for all remotes of food. Very glad I bought them! I‚Äôm going to get more of different sizes for cereal, oats, sugar, flour etc. would recommend!"
""
I had an infestation of pantry moths and they are horrible! So I ordered these to keep our food sealed and free of their nasty larvae. Life saver!!! I‚Äôm going to order more. I love that they come with labels and my pantry looks amazing and organized. My kids freaked out when they saw how neat it was. 100% recommend!!!
This is the 2 nd time I hav purchased these. I have them in my pantry. I also have them in my baking area. I will be using these in my new fridge when it comes too.
I got these to organize my cabinets and to start putting my chips in because my boyfriend has a bad habit of leaving the bag open . We LOVE them!! You can write on them with the sticker & marker they give you ! They look so much better than a bunch of chip bags laying around! We use it for so much more than chips though! Definitely recommend !
Love how my pantry looks with these. The different size varieties are great. They snap on & off very easily. Great for snacks for my kids. I did not use the stick on labels since it‚Äôs obvious what‚Äôs inside
I bought these during black Friday sale. Def worth it. I've had an issues with those grain moths. I like that they are all rectangular and airtight with 4 way clamps on the lid.
Love how these made my cabinet space more organized. It‚Äôs so much easier to find what I need.
This is exactly what my folks needed to keep their dry goods fresh and not get stale. Easy snap on/off tops. Definitely recommend üòä
"The products are definitely super cute, clear just like I like it. The only downside is that they don‚Äôt have the same size (like the little ones of stacked are not the same size as the big one). So me and my OCD kinda don‚Äôt like this üòÇ"
"Very durable, easy to clean and very sturdy. I was doubtful that it‚Äôd be air tight but two weeks in and my cereal and snacks are just as fresh as the day I transferred them into the containers. Would recommend"
"Being away from home means critters move in and take over the pantry‚Ä¶what a mess! These are the perfect solution: affordable,sturdy,available in many sizes,and easy to clean. I‚Äôm wishing I had done this ages ago! I want to be prepared for Emergencies and these will be the way I keep the pantry full of fresh supplies."
"These containers hold up well, and the different sizes work great for different food boxes like cereal, crackers, granola, etc."
"I love these containers, just wish they were German Shepard proof. Ordered more to replace the one that got chewed Love love the labels"
Gave as Christmas gifts to daughter & granddaughter. They just loved them. Gave them more storage room in their pantries. The price was right for all the containers that you receive.
I really like this set! I marked it down ny one star under sturdiness because one unit arrived broken but overall I'm happy with the set.
I was hoping that they would be like glass clear. But they‚Äôre hazy. I still love them tho.
I like the quality of the plastic.... easy to use and looks nice with the availability to quickly see what is getting low.
I changed the look of my old pantry with this modern touch. Price of $45 is really worth.
Using these containers gave me a lot more space in the pantry! The lids are super sturdy. Love the labels and white pen.
These are amazing well worth the money. My cabinet looks simply marvelous.
Took me sometime to right the review but here goes. These containers work well I recommend my only issue being when I finally decided to open and use them long after buying them only then I realized that I got the package with two of the lids damaged
The lids seem to be very durable. Only suggestion is to include a better chalk pen for the labels
Love the way it fits in my cabinets and I'm able to organize so much stuff with it.
Love the assortment of sizes and different types of stickers for labeling if you choose to do so. Makes it easy for my kids to refill and keep track of what we are low on for shopping
These have made rearranging my mudroom a breeze. They hold almost anything you need to store.
I live in an RV so the pantry is TINY!! This really helped me utilize the vertical space i have and left plenty of room in front of the containers for things like cans and peanut butter. Now i can grab things without everything else toppling over. So happy i bought this!
"I used this container set to store spices, powders & different lentils. Labels are great & being clear plastic is very helpful. Pleased with this set."
Excellent value for the number of containers that are included. I would definitely order again from this company.
I love the airtight lids and the slender containers. They fit in tight spaces. The labels make them so much prettier
They really keep food fresh and I like the size of the containers
This product has been perfect. It stores food and keeps it safe from bugs. I thought the smallest size container might be too small but it actually is the perfect size for the contents from a box of noodles or bag of nuts. A whole box of cereal fits in the tallest size containers. They are clear and not foggy. Everything came as expected! Very happy with my purchase.
Love the freshness lick on the lid
Great product. I actually ended up buying more because they are very versatile.
Reasonably priced and soooooo handy in my pantry!
I'm in love...real love lol ‚ù§Ô∏è buy it!
Works great. Seems to be keeping my food fresh. Not clear not the picture. Works great.
Good quality. Everything fits securely and is well organized
"Muy pr√°cticos, eficientes hermetismo de la tapa. Muy buena calidad del material."
Couldn't have asked for something better to organize the pantry.
Absolutely love these! Did not regret this purchase. Buy it! Don‚Äôt think about it.
"Great product, good for organizing and keeps food fresh."
Have been able to organize my pantry to hold more items and being able to select at a glance is great.
"Loved the set , very practical and loved the idea of having the measurements at the sides of the containers"
"I am BIG on glass storage containers. So when i saw these, I was like okay lets read these reviews.  I saw a lot of reviews stating the lids do not lock. With locking lids of any kind, you have to make sure the lid is placed properly on the container. Then you have to snap the longer sides before you do the two ends or it will be uneven and not snap into place. I have NEVER had an issue snapping these lids shut.  Also, the silicone rings on the lids that make them seal, I feel it is fantastic that they come out. This makes cleaning them so much easier. They are also really easy to put back on as well. Literally took me 2 seconds to put it back in. If you look, there are notches on the lids so you can take them out to clean and put them back in.  I absolutely love these. They are super sturdy. Very thick glass. Perfect for my lunch prep. I feel like most of the negative reviews are just people being impatient or not understanding how they work. The price on these too were wonderful!"
"These containers are amazing. The seal is strong, and it latches securely. The containers travel very well because of this. They have become my go to work dishes because they are microwave safe, air tight for dry snacks, and clean easily. They can range from 400¬∞c (752¬∞f) to -20¬∞c (-4¬∞) so they are great for meal prep too!  At home they are fantastic as I can bake in them, let the stuff cool, slap on a lid and place it in the fridge. I also love that you can hear them click. A great flag is that you don't need two hands on it to open or close it. I am in a sling most of the day, so this is a huge plus for me.  I would recommend this set to anyone!"
"I have been use this for couple weeks. It‚Äôs feels amazing. This is never leak in my lunch bag. Also, I love the material. I really hate the plastic box, because I love eat my food hot. If I use plastic box, when the microwave temperature too high, the plastic one will be melt. It‚Äôs looks like very unhealthy. That‚Äôs why I choose glass box. Also, I use this glass box for my leftover, those box never let my food dry. I love this so much, I already purchas one more set for my mom. I believe she gonna love it more."
Fast delivery. Great product. Love that they nest.
These are solid glass and the lids snap on very easy and seal very well. I have had them for a couple months and so far no breaks. I think they‚Äôll last a long time. So much healthier than plastics! We use them for leftovers all the time and warm up in oven without the lid on of course.
"My wife and I have an infant and decided to switch from plastic storage containers to glass for health reasons. These are really nice: surprisingly light, lids fit perfect with very satisfying snap and they're super easy to clean. The only thing that we're not thrilled about is the fact that they don't stack very well and take up quite a bit of space. At the same time I understand why (more volume) and it is small price to pay for healthy storage solution."
"These storage containers are great. Durable, thick glass. I have taken them from fridge to microwave with no problems. Make my fridge and storage drawers look very organized."
"Found a better set at my local Sams Club and LOVE them! Instead of 3 nesting I only need 2 slots. I don‚Äôt feel like I got much bang for my buck here, as opposed to the second set I bought which was both better quality and nest a TON a better. If I could return I total would have. Wasted time and money on this product.  *UPDATE I AM NOW BEING CONSTANTLY HARASSED BY THIS COMPANY"
"I got these to replace my old ‚Äúmeal prep‚Äù containers and am so glad I went with glass instead of plastic. These are really good quality and work great. These are a nice improvement from your traditional storage containers with the snap-on lids. They are excellent quality and have come in handy; we use them just about every day.  They are oven safe which was exactly what I was looking for. My microwave broke a few months ago, so it is nice to have good containers that can withstand the high temperatures of an oven. I no longer have to dirty up pots to reheat my food and on top of that, the glass doesn‚Äôt get too hot.  They are a good size and most importantly, they don‚Äôt leak like the last set I had. With these, you don‚Äôt have to worry about a huge mess or your food going bad. They actually have an airtight seal, keeping the food nice and fresh. I will warn that the seals do come out when you put them in the dishwasher, but for me, this wasn‚Äôt a big deal since they are easy to put back on. I‚Äôd rather have to push the seal back in than have to wash them by hand.  Overall, love these containers"
"Things I liked about this product: * It's really leakproof. I carried pasta with lot of sauce in it, and it did not leak outside. I also tried filling the container with water and tried holding it vertically and the water stayed inside. * The different sizes are very convenient, serves for multiple purposes. I'm using the two smaller ones (2.66 and 3.4 oz) as lunchboxes, and the bigger ones for storing food in refrigerator. Most other similar products have 6 containers in the same size, which are useless for a single person. * Easy to clean. I use lots of spices in my food, and when heating lunch in plastic containers, sometimes the plastic had retained the spice odor and/or color. Being glass, these boxes are easy to clean, and does not stain. The plastic lids are also easy to clean. * Easy to carry. I have noticed people complaining about weight in some reviews for glass containers (in general, didn't see for this one). I don't really know how heavy is too heavy, considering glass is expected to heavier than plastic, naturally. I just wanna say that I had no trouble carrying the 2.66 and 3.4 oz to work by walking 30mins. * White lids. Color is not much of an issue considering the purpose, but I was disappointed that most other similar products I looked for came in colors like pink, skyblue, limegreen etc. These being white, they won't clash against anyone's kitchen arrangement. * The product arrived on time and well-packaged. The glass looks sturdy. The smaller ones fit (with lid) inside the bigger ones, so its easy to store when you are not using them."
"I am honestly amazed by these containers. I have been trying to make the switch from plastic from glass. My biggest concern with switching is that most all of the glass containers have leaked, which I hate. So when these came in, the first thing I did was test for leaks, because there is nothing worse than filling a dish with soup leftovers, only to be left with an arm full of soup upon picking it up. And oh my gosh, these don't leak!!! I put water in and shook it around real good and NO leaks!!! Amazing!!! And now I won't have any more melted plastic in my food when I reheat them in the microwave! Even more awesomeness!! I am SO glad that I took a chance and got these, they are well worth the cost for the peace of mind knowing that I am not consuming plastic AND not having leaks all over my fridge!"
"I really like these containers. I have searched high and low for the most non-toxic and environmentally friendly storage options. This is the best one I found that also matches our minimalist style.  Glass is sturdy. I've used it in the microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher without a problem. The lids are plastic with a rubber/silicone seal but the food almost never touches the lid so that minimizes the risk of plastic leaching into the food. I also handwash the lids and never use them in the microwave. That helps minimize the risk even more.  Food have never leaked, even my pho broth. I feel like they will last me a very long time.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a storage container that is reliable, safe, and simple."
"I was looking to replace 25 oz square Glad plastic containers for taking lunch (and sometimes dinner) to work. I could not find the square glass containers of 25 oz size but these containers are 22 oz and are pretty close to what I was looking for.  Through reading reviews of various glass lunch boxes I learned that the weak points of these containers are the vents which begin to leak not long after being put to use, so I was looking for covers without vents. Finally, I was looking for a good price per container. They were $19.99 when I bought them, so $3.33 per container - not too bad. Although they are 4 bucks cheaper as I write this review and I am a little annoyed. I should have used Amazon price tracker site camelcamelcamel site to make sure I am not getting the highest historical price.  I need to be able to fit two containers in my lunch bag, so the size with the lids on was very important to me. I was not sure how the measurements in the product description were taken.  Measurements with the lids on: 5.25"" width x 7"" length x 2.5"" height. Two containers fit into a lunch bag sized 6""W x 8.5""L x 6.5""H.  The package arrived well packaged in foam for each container. None of the containers were damaged, the lids close well, the containers are leak proof. I am pretty pleased with the purchase. Note that the instructions say not to put lids into the microwave. I have kept them out and the containers continue to be leak free.  Ali Julia review"
"These are nice for more tha just food prep. They have a nice plastic lid that seals. They have 4 clip with a silicone gasket seals like snapware. There is 6 glass based and 6 plastic lids. There is 2 styles of containers rectangle and square. Three of each style. The glass is freezer, oven, microwave and dishwasher safe. The lids are freezer safe only, but they are BPA free. These will be great for my daughter just starting out."
"Wonderful product! We've been using it for 60+ days to test before writing a review.  - Weight of glass, thickness, fine finishing. You can tell it's well made. - The glass is not tinted slightly green or blue, as many other containers. This is actually white/clear glass. No oils or gravies have stained the glass or the lid, and no odor buildup. - The lids do not have a vent hole. I personally like that because those tiny flimsy caps are annoying to clean, come apart often, and not very useful. - Variety of shapes and sizes. Fits and stacks in your fridge or cupboard well.  The only drawback is that they are not very airtight -- cookies stored in them went a little moist after a few days. But I did not buy them for being 100% airtight, so it's ok for me. They are also pretty good to hold liquids inside."
"The product works in all environments - stove, oven, microwave, and the lids are secured on all four sides! Very sturdy, no leaks. Only one thing could have made them better - if they came in this size and a couple in a larger size."
"I am in love with this product and especially like that the containers are dishwasher safe. When the product arrived I put each piece including tops in the dishwasher for good cleaning and sanitization. They came out clean with a pleasant smell and did I mention when taking out of the box, not one was broken. The different sizes make food storage better, who wants to store a small amount of food in a big container, and many times just because you have a little food leftover doesn't mean you want to throw it out...that small amount could be your late evening snack. The containers look good in my cabinet, I just open, get the size I need and storage is right there. I've placed the containers in the freezer and the food is sealed tight no freezer burns or ice in the food. So get rid of all those plastic containers with no tops and purchase these containers...you'll be glad you did."
"The lids don't fit on some of the containers. Was going to return it but my husband already threw away the box so now I am left with some containers that can't use because the lids won't fit!  Update from my last review. I am giving it a 5 star rating because the seller reached out to me and offered a replacement set. When my replacement set came, was happy and satisfied, all lids fitted perfectly, except that one lid was missing. So when the seller reached out to me if I have any issues with the replacement set, I mentioned to him that one lid was missing. Again, the seller offered me a solution, either a $10 refund or issue me another replacement. I opted for the replacement since I really love the containers. I am really satisfied and happy with the customer service of this seller."
"I got these because the pyrex containers leak terribly when carrying a dish-to-share. I still wanted a glass container so I could reheat in them (without melting/staining like happens with the plastic ones; and without getting 2 different containers soiled). Because they are clear glass I can easily see what container has which left-over. These are nice and heavy glass with sealing lids (not glass) that clamp tightly over each side of the dish. When reheating I remove the lid and use a silicone cover, plastic wrap or paper towel depending on the food in the dish. I'm very happy with these containers."
"I've had these dishes for a little bit now and they're just as good as the best products on the market. You can have liquid in the dishes and not worry about them spilling and they seem thick enough that if you were to drop them, they wouldn't break. I'm not going to test that but I don't think it'd be an issue.  The packaging that the product came in is attractive and the products are very well protected within the box. They do state on the box that if you have any issues, to contact the company and they'll be able to help you further so they do stand behind their products.  As the description states, you get 8 containers with 6 square/rectangle and 2 circular. Personally, I prefer the rectangular containers anyways so I'm not worried about having more of one shape versus another.  To make a comparison, although it's not apples to apples, I have a set of non-locking Pyrex containers and these seem to be much more sturdy of a product. The glass is thicker and I don't know that the lids should ever be an issue with tearing, like I've had with the Pyrex. Again, those don't lock but these do, but I think that these seem better for the price."
"I haven‚Äôt tried to check is it‚Äôs leakproof yet. I probably should have before I wrote this. But I can attest to the seals being good as they can stick to the glass when you take off the lid sometimes. That may bother some people as I‚Äôve read a bunch of reviews across multiple products like this that the seal comes off. It doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest as I store them with lids off and would take the seal off anyway when I‚Äôm cleaning them. They are the perfect portion for me whether it‚Äôs a salad or dinner containing a drumstick, some stir fry and a couple fingerling potatoes for dinner. The thickness of the glass is enough to make them feel hefty without being cumbersome. Breeze to clean because of the glass and the lids easy to clean too. I don‚Äôt heat up the food with the lid on or anything so there isnt much to clean on the lid itself.  TL;DR - These are pretty great, bought 2 sets. Haven‚Äôt tried to use in oven or freezer. I just use them as meal prep containers. Microwave with lid off. Easy to clean. Good packaging."
"Usually don't review things unless its a negative one. These are really great containers. They seal well, clamp down and STAY closed. Pyrex ones after heat/dishwasher crack and don't seal well. These are a tiny bit more work to clean the lids but the lids are such better quality and I really like that they snap into place.  If I had to nitpick I would like the containers to be a bit deeper/large and as mentioned they are a bit more work to clean the lids/keep the gunk off the lid.  Highly recommended if you want food containers that are a good value as well as keep the food fresh and sealed."
"‚ïî ‚ñ† Price Point: 4.5/5 ‚ï† ‚ñ† Quality: 5/5 ‚ï† ‚ñ† Lid Strength: 5/5 ‚ï† ‚ñ† Recommendation: 5/5 ‚ï† ‚òº Overall: 5/5 ‚ï† ‚ñ∫Product Need: 6 large heavy glass containers ‚ï† ‚ñ∫Product Pros: Dishwasher/Microwave safe, lid grip, heavy glass ‚ï† ‚ñ∫Cons to Consider: Lids not microwave safe ‚ï† ‚ñ∫My Review: I quickly grew sick of buying the plastic container sets, only for it to stain, get warped, and that I have so many of the little tiny containers I never use. I decided to upgrade into glass for a safer and easier way of storing my leftovers. They are a tad heavier to bring for long journeys to work, but like them better overall. They are easier to clean, store food really well with the 4 tab closing seal lid, heats up evenly, and all 6 have a good size. I only wish I could also put the lid in the microwave. These have definitely been the worthwhile investment and would recommend anyone looking for food storage containers."
"I wanted containers that could go from freezer or fridge to microwave or preheated oven. These glass meal prep containers have been great! No leaking, chips, cracks or uneven cooking. I hand wash the lids and put the glass containers in the dishwasher with no problem. They stack neatly in the cupboard. The rubber ring can pop out, but I just use a butter knife to tuck it back into place. I don't store my containers with the lids on and I place a sheet of saran wrap between the lid and glass when it's going in the fridge or freezer to keep the rubber seal from separating. Sometimes the containers are a little tricky to lock close, but it's just a matter of realigning the lids. The glass isn't as heavy as, say a Pyrex measuring cup, but it's sturdy for the intended purpose. As soon as I'm able I'll be buying another set of Bayco glass meal prep containers."
"This is my first purchase into the snapping-lid glassware. I did a bit of research before deciding on Bayco, and once I read the reviews and saw the price, I was in. Once I received them in the mail and used them a few times, I'm impressed by the quality of the make and the seal. Getting lids to snap on any snapware (I've worked in people's homes and have daily experienced other brands) is always a pain to get it right every time, and Bayco is no different. I'm not sure any brand will ever get that right.  My favorite part is that Bayco offers sizes I will actually USE. They don't offer these convoluted variety packs of a thousand teensy dishes and just a couple bigger ones. This pack in particular came with 5 uniform containers! I am SOLD!!! I do wish they had bigger sizes in these uniform packs. 36oz is great for packing my lunches, but when I store leftovers, I often need a bigger container.  I managed to find a usable variety Bayco pack with one bigger size (51oz), and am hoping they will make more of those in the future, even if selling them individually."
"These are just the right size for lunch. I bought these and a bigger size for meal prep and to stop losing things in the fridge because I used recycled ricotta containers that were opaque and forgot they had other stuff in them. Glass part is solid (pretty substantial, a bit heavy but I‚Äôm used to plastic so...). The lids fit very tight and I‚Äôve seen no leaking. You have to make sure the rim of the container is clean or you might have difficulty closing it. I‚Äôm quite satisfied with the quality so far and they‚Äôre in heavy rotation since they arrived. I may look for additional sizes to add to the collection. I would definitely buy them again."
"I did find some broken pieces of glass inside one of the containers after I washed them thoroughly and dried them. I had fruit (cherry's) in one of them. My son finished eating the fruit and when I went to get the container to wash it I noticed the pieces of glass in it at the very bottom. There were about 3 small pieces of glass. Almost seemed as if the edges of the containers broke apart. I checked on all the containers to check for safety but each piece of container had smooth thick, clean, safe edges. I was worried. I don't know what happen or how I found glass inside the container I had carefully washed and dried. Just be careful when you used them check inside before pouring/placing anything inside them as a precaution. My experience is a mystery. I have been using the containers a lot, and as of right now, I feel comfortable and safe using them. I really do love the quality and look of the glass containers."

"These just arrived today, in perfect condition. I completed my transition from plastic. But my shelves were unruly, with one type of glass bowl and another container and not much order. I got rid of old dishes which were not transparent. These fit really nicely on my shelves. They are easy to access and organize. The sizes and shapes will make it possible for me to find just the right container, mainly for frig storage in my case. None of them are too big and all are large enough to have a ready use. The choice of shapes makes everything seem to have its logical use. They stack in minimal space. I put a paper towell in each bowl so it would not clatter with the one below. All the lids of a given size fit on the top of the corresponding stack. I have no reason to think that this glass will fail to perform and stay unbroken with reasonable use."
"I'm very happy with this purchase. I have been using plastic containers since college days and although I love the convenience of plastic containers, I hated that it would stain after I put certain types of food. Glass is a bit on the heavier side but much easier to clean, does not stain, and holds the food! The one thing I would say about these containers that, I find myself having trouble to close the lid sometimes with certain containers. Regards to portion size, this pack comes with different sizes and can fit various food items."
"These containers are worth the investment. I have been slowly switching out my old plastic ware to these glass snap lid containers. They are extremely versatile. They can go from freezer to fridge and into the oven or microwave, using necessary precautions.  The lids are BPA free plastic, however they last and last, the snap locks ensure everything stays fresh. I Prep all of my fresh produce into these for use throughout the week. There is nothing nicer than opening my fridge and seeing the display of neatly stacked and organized glass containers. It makes finding what you need extremely easy."
"I find these containers very useful for storing food in my refrigerator, freezer and on my countertop. Although the containers do leak slightly if filled with water, inverted and shaken vigorously as demonstrated by other customers, they leak less than other containers I had with a lid. Despite this minor problem, they seem to do an excellent job of keeping the food fresh (especially in the freezer) and do not leak when the containers are stored in their normal upright position. The containers also stack well, and their rectangular shape helps you to make the best use of available space. Also, the 36 ounce container works great for storing tofu without making a mess (see photo)! The lid fits perfectly after the tofu is sliced.  I am glad that I got 2 different sizes. Often, I will initially place food into a larger container. After I use up a sufficient amount of the food, I transfer the remainder to a smaller container in order to take up less space.  These containers work great for batch cooking, where you prepare a large quantity of food then store it in several containers for future use. I am trying to learn to do this since I don't like to spend a lot of time cooking. When I do this, I typically store 1 container in the refrigerator for immediate use and any additional containers in the freezer to be later thawed in the refrigerator after finishing the 1st batch."
"These have held up ok so far, been using a bit now for lunch. Wife takes em on the bus in her backpack, they hold up ok. So far, no unexpected opening, leaking, or issues. Kinda awkward to store due to 3 different shaped containers, square, rectangle, and round. I imagined would all nest together for some raisin. But these things are versatile, like a chamelon, yeah! Uh huh yeah! I‚Äôm talking about the beat goes on, yeah. And the beat goes on, yeah. And the beat goes on! And the videoscope, yeah, I am looking right into you right now. Macho madness, right now. Sugar is sweet and so is honey. Macho madness is on a roll and it can‚Äôt be stopped, no. Elizabeth understands what I‚Äôm talking about, yeah uh huh!"
"I hate the smell of plastic tupperware after multiple uses. I also hate how they stain. I also don't like microwaving them either. With these glass containers, I don't have any of those issues. They clean up easy and are super air tight and durable. I plan on going another set because people kept stealing them at my work üòí... So I know its good stuff when they do that üòâ"
"I bought these because I absolutely can‚Äôt stand plastic. It‚Äôs wasteful, it‚Äôs stains, and after a while it just becomes nasty. So I decided to buy glass tupperware. I love the glass, I love the lids, they are a little smaller than I realized, but overall it‚Äôs a pretty amazing product. I actually waited almost a month and a half to write my review as I wanted to make sure the glass could hold up and it has! I‚Äôve had no chips, no breaks, it seals well, overall the only thing I would have to say is they‚Äôre smaller than I expected but that is a misinterpretation on my part. I definitely would recommend these 100%!!!"
"Faster delivery than first promised. The containers were packed safely. GOOD QUALITY i bought glass containers last month from another company and liked then so much that I looked for similar glass containers because they were out of stock. These glass containers are practically the same and had a mixture of shapes round, square and rectangle so they fit comfortably in the refrigerator. I love them the glass container is much healthier than plastic. I got rid of ALL my plastic containers. OOPS! At first I thought 3 containers were missing but when I completed un-packing I found the 3 smaller containers inside 3 larger ones. : )  Definitely buy them it is a must to have."
"These containers are honestly pretty high quality containers for the price. They are a great size for my weekly lunch meal preps. They're a little on the heavy side but that really just makes them durable, which is more than worth it for me. The glass container part is very easy to clean, whether by hand or in the dishwasher.  Since the product description says to avoid washing the lids in the dishwasher I've been washing the lids by hand which is mildly inconvenient but no big deal. The lids do also have to get centered correctly on the container when you close it otherwise they can be a little difficult to snap on.  In case it's not clear in the description, these are glass containers with a snap-on plastic lid. I'm hoping the seal in the lid lasts a long time, but so far so good! Definitely worth a purchase."
The containers keep my left over food stay in fresh. I use the container to be my lunch box. The best thing is to keep my frige clean and organized.
"Delivery went well & on time. üëçüèºüëçüèº  All of the containers are well made. The clips are made of plastic, so I‚Äôm hoping after awhile they won‚Äôt break off from usage.  I tested one with water and there wasn‚Äôt any leaking.  They hold 2c of food. Nice for leftovers.  Added comment: They seal really nice and tight. My first use of leftover spaghetti sauce the plastic lid didn‚Äôt absorb the redness like other plastic things I‚Äôve bought. üëçüèºüëçüèº"
"I LOVE THESE. I USE THEM EVERY DAY! They came in perfect condition, on time, and packaged very well and neatly. I do want to address a few concerns I saw in other reviews that may help. 1. At first the lids may be hard to get all four sections snapped, but once you do it a few times it gets easy. The rubber inserts in lid channels just have to loosen up a bit since they are brand new, but they will seat on containers very easily after a few times. 2. The circle containers are more difficult since there are no corners to hold lid in place while you snap lid on. DON‚ÄôT GIVE UP. Keep centering the lids and they will snap. At first I had to leave one snap undone, then after a few times I learned to just center the lid, press down firmly, and all 4 snaps engaged. 3. I will not be putting the lids in dishwasher to wash but the containers wash beautifully in dishwasher. I wash the lids by hand. Just takes about 30 seconds then I set on dish rack to dry. 4. For storage, I stack them with lids on, then by shape and by size from largest on bottom to smaller on top. I have the room and I hate searching for lids. I recommend this if you have the room. 5. Yes they are on the smaller side but they are perfect for leftovers ...dang, I use these everyday and they look so nice and organized in the refrigerator. 5. They don‚Äôt stain or smell of old food. So nice. If I think of anything else I‚Äôll edit and add . I am very please with this purchase. I‚Äôd like to buy another set but I don‚Äôt need it since it‚Äôs just my husband and I now at home."
"I meal prep every Sunday and cannot find leak proof Tupperware or containers. My friend told me that I should purchase glass containers with airtight lids. So I decided to search on Amazon for some that were affordable. I did not like the idea of paying $35 for a set of 6, just to find out that they leak. Eff that! I bought these on a whim and for $11ish you can't beat that! I made stewed chicken with some veggies and added some black beans. I placed the lids on the containers and flipped them upside down over the sink (in case I experienced some spillage) and like magic, they worked. None of the juices spilled out or dripped out due to the ring that surrounds the lid, keeping it airtight. I am purchasing another set because I'm sold!"
"Adore mis containers, los encuentro s√∫per pr√°cticos, El size de cada uno es justo lo que estaba buscando. El cierre perfecto en todos. El env√≠o fue s√∫per r√°pido, y seguro, solo una recomendaci√≥n para los que realizan la entrega es q tengan cuidado a la hora de transportar estos productos pues es cristal y mi apartamento no es grande pero si sent√≠ como algo q hab√≠a puesto en la puerta, no afirmo q lanzaran nada pero si q sent√≠ el momento en q la pusieron, es solo una sugerencia, el resto s√∫per complacida y los recomiendo."
"I AM IN LOVE. I really wanted to get some more heavy duty containers to transport my lunches to and from work in, but wasn't sure what kind. Previously I was using plastic containers, but after several washes and warm-ups in the microwave, they ended up being flimsy and not very functional. Plastic seems to stain after a few uses as well. I really didn't even know that I wanted glass containers, but these are amazing. They are the perfect size for daily lunches, and come out of the dishwasher so clean each time. They are really heavy duty and I haven't had a single issue with spilling, etc. I haven't put the lids in the microwave or dish washer, so haven't had any issues with the lid yet."
"These containers seem to be well built, but a little smaller than I expected. The largest containers allow me to pack soup, or something else I need to reheat for lunch. It would be nicer, if the lids were microwave safe. Having to separately cover the dish with paper towel is a pain, but the provided covers do seal the containers very well. Each shape is nestable at the various sizes. It is not a good idea to leave the tops on during storage."
"Bought first set to check these containers out, I was so pleased with the containers that I ordered another set. They close tight, wash up without any issues and the container themselves are heavy duty. I highly recommend these and when checking out how much I paid in the past for those cheap plastic container, these weren't that much more. I saved my plastic containers to give food away to neighbors, so all and all a win win. STAY SAFE YA'LL!"
My Pyrex lid kept cracking and does not provide a good seal for soupy stuff. So I‚Äôve been moving my tubberwares set to ones with the latch. This set feels solid and the latch provides a secure seal on liquids. It did come with a bunch of warning / info. I‚Äôm surprised by the 700 degree temperatures. I probably will still go way before the threshold since other glass have known to explode. Just to be on the safe side. Overall this set provides all the common sizes I use most and feels similar to other name brands.
"I was tired of my plastic Tupperware containers getting warped from the dishwasher, stained, melted, crusted, etc; but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on Pyrex. I've been using this set for over a month, and it is easily comparable to Pyrex or other higher-priced container and Tupperware brands. They wash nicely, the lids fasten securely, and the temperature-resistant glass allows for easy storage from fridge to reheating. They are always sparkling clean, even when they go in the dishwasher completely covered in pasta sauce. Absolutely recommended!"
"Bought these for a friend as a gift because she cannot tolerate the chemicals that leach into food stores in plastic. I chose this set in particular for its range of sizes, and this brand because it was listed as oven, microwave, and dishwasher safe. My friend was thrilled, and will be ordering more for herself. They arrived well packaged and in good time. They are well-made and are proving to be durable. They are very convenient sizes, and the tight seals keep the moths out and flavor in. I‚Äôve purchased some for myself because my friend likes hers so well."
"Purchased these when we needed more glass containers to pack lunch to work. We used to use rectangular Pyrex containers which were shallower. These ones are similar in length and width but a little deeper, which I appreciate so that we have more room for food that are more bulky. They are quite leak proof, but it's a little tricky to get the lids to line up perfectly with the container so that all 4 sizes are locked. A bit of practice is needed and I always find myself having to apply some force to properly lock the lid in place. These are deep and will take up storage space when not in use. So I wish the design was more stackable."
"I am always on the hunt for glass storage containers because I do not believe that the plastic ones are healthy for us especially when heating food. I am very impressed so far with these containers. they are made of thick glass which will help with drops and sturdiness. The lids seal very well and do not seem to leak just as advertised. I was shocked to find that these are actually bigger than I expected them to be. In the past I have received smaller containers that were advertised similarly. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend these and would buy them again!"
"All of my plastic containers are starting to wear out/get really stained and I am replacing everything with glass. I have used them a few times and they have gone through my dishwasher-I even left something in my car overnight so it was slightly gross. It cleaned right out very easily. Also put it in the freezer with a meal in it, and the container has handled everything really well. Haven't dropped one yet so I'm not sure how easily they break. This seems to be the perfect size container for meal prep for me, I will be purchasing another set of them for sure!"
"I love these containers. Reasonable price and great product. The glass is heavy duty , and so are the lids . The lids are way better quality than I expected. It's got an almost beveled or frosted lining around the top and then the middle is see-through. Love the color selections. I have not tested leakproff yet so didnt rate that. Gave 4 star for size because i thought the larger ones would be,larger. Shipping was fast and was assumingly handled with care, nothing was broken. Packaged nicely."
I bought these glass containers because I don't like to heat food up in the microwave in plastic. The lids have a great seal but cannot be used in the microwave so be sure to remove them before heating. Someone heated one of mine with the lid on and I ended up having to throw the entire thing away. I never did get the lid off even trying to pry it off with a knife! I was disappointed because it was new and also a good size. I would buy these again in a heartbeat.
I like the variety of sizes. I probably could have used one really big one but it‚Äôs not a big deal. I really love having these and the kids have been working just fine! I do remove the rubber seal every time I wash them and wonder how long they‚Äôll last but so far so good!
"I brought these because they are leak proof, glass and can go in the microwave. They do exactly what they say. So far I have used them for lunch for work and holding leftovers. Soup, oatmeal, pasta with sauce. Nothing has leaked and I can heat them up right in the microwave.  Pros: They are glass They are leak proof They can go into the microwave Easy to clean You can put them in the oven Great price 4 locking tabs  Cons They are heavier than plastic"
I love the way I KNOW when these lids are closed. No tipping over and leaky lids... they don't budge.. NO Leaking out. No air getting in. Perfect size for leftovers too :) May be back for more. 6 months later and I AM back for more. Getting rid of ALL my other glassware that don't have lids. Woo hoo!
"Like a lot of people, our family switching to a more green lifestyle. This included getting a lot of not all off the plastic we could out of our house. I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about another popular brand, but wanted to see what else was out there. I stumbled across this amazing set and was instantly sold! The kids are leak proof! I even turned mine upside with soup in it, and it stayed closed. They all also conveniently store together kind of like a nesting bowl. They hold heat well, and were super easy to clean. Not to mention they are dishwasher safe. So far we‚Äôve used them for Thanksgiving and leftovers. Thankfully they aren‚Äôt chunky so there‚Äôs still plenty of room in the fridge! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new food storage. Plus you can‚Äôt beat the price!"
Just received this and everything is in perfect condition no chips or other issues. Sparkly clean beautifully packaged. Put some utensils inside so you can get a better idea of the size is absolutely perfect variety!!
"I've bought glass & plastic containers for 20 years. These are by far some of the best ones I've used. They are very strong and sturdy. I've used them in the fridge, the freezer, with liquid, solids, bread. No matter what I throw at them, they just are amazing. I've washed them in the dishwasher with no issues. The lids are strong and snap with a satisfying click. The rubber seal is easily removed if you want to clean them separately. 10/10 would recommend!"
"these are very nice and sturdy. They have no chance of leaking and keep food good for a long time. They are easy to clean and the rubber on the lids come out for more in depth cleaning and can easily be put back! I only wish they were bigger and that the lids were more easy to stack. If i'd have known all of this before i bought them, i would have kept looking. They are very nice just kind of annoying (: wonderful for the price."
"I‚Äôve had this set for about a month and have used many times to fill with food for my son and his girl. They have been stacked in bags and traveled in cars multiple times. They do the job. No leaking, no chipping. I came back to purchase another set but the price increased by $10. So that‚Äôs a big me never mind."
"my Tupperware collection looks so much better. They have thick glass, a good thing because I'm clumsy. a lot of people complain they can't close them but I don't have that problem, you just have to position them correctly. Also easy to clean, I always make sure I take out the rubber part to wash separately. if you don't it will create mold."
"These are perfectly sized for meal prep & storing smaller portioned leftovers. These have absolutely become my go to since I purchased them. The glass is much thicker than I expected, I feel confident I don‚Äôt need to worry about it shattering. Totally all purpose...toss in the oven or toss in the freezer, . I use these for everything being a single women. Easy clean up & store well in small places. Lids snap on & off easily, Without leaking. I see other reviews mention issues with the lids, I have had none so far. I would love another set before the holidays roll around."
I‚Äôve been using these container all week for my lunches and they are great. It keeps my meals fresh and does not alter taste when reheated. Very easy to wash and store away.
"I wanted to move away from using plastic and plastic-like material containers, and these are exactly what I was looking for! The all-different size containers are great quality and have excellent sealing/leak-proof capabilities. I stack the 3 different shapes/sizes respectively to use less storage space, but if you have ample storage then don't stack them to avoid clanking the glass together (or put something between each container to avoid clanking)."
"I use these dishes to store leftovers. They are great! They are large enough to fit a whole serving, yet thin enough to not take up too much room in the fridge! They are easily transported in my lunchbox and I love being able to reheat leftovers in the same container (the less dishes the better!). I am slowly making the change from plastic containers to glass containers. Plastic containers sometimes retain odor which I find extremely unpleasant. Also, plastic sometimes tends to stain and look yellow or old. Therefore, im switching to glass and these are great!"
"I had purchased a set of glass storage containers from Target and immediately took them back, really couldn‚Äôt fit anything in 4 of them but a half stick of butter. This set however is exactly what I was looking for. I often pack food for my 48 hour shifts and after a month or so, these containers have held up well. I‚Äôve used them in the microwave and haven‚Äôt skipped a beat with them. Not sure how they hold up in the oven as I haven‚Äôt used it there yet. I purchased this large set with the normal size set and they compliment each other well. Overall, great purchase."
"Arrived on time as per amazon prime, but that packaging was a hassle. The amount of plastic I threw away gave me anxiety and then I realized that amazon probably doesn‚Äôt give a shit about that stuff. But if you‚Äôre an eco conscious nerd and want glass Tupperware to save the planet the packaging will ruin this for you. It‚Äôs like glass Tupperware but at what cost since each enclosure upon arrival is included with its own film of cellophane. Otherwise seems worth? So far of accurate quality as description. Glass is tough and seals right. The smaller sizes fit about three chopped green onions and one and a half bell pepper. Medium rectangular container supported a typical order of cooked asparagus and honestly the medium circular one fits a great oatmeal/ granola bowl idk if that helps. Would give 100% Rec if not for plastic especially when I searched for the item it was a main contender for eco friendly Tupperware so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Few days back I purchased these containers. At the time of placing order little bit scared because it's a glass product may be it will damage at the time of transport. After receiving product I am totally surprised it's well packaged and the package is in good condition. Containers can fit into each other.Glass is thick and lids can snap easily.Containers are very light and it's durable,study.For lids they used very high quality plastic.I am using these for left overs also.Now my fridge is looking well organized. Hubby likes to take work place also.These are oven and freezer safe.I didn't use in dishwasher coz I don't have that. Really it's good product"
"I wanted to say goodbye to the habit of re-using BPA-laden plastic takeout containers for all my home-cooked food. Needed a new set of cheap, microwave safe glass tupperware containers. This set fit the bill perfectly! They arrived in great shape with no cracks or chips. The packaging is robust. Glad to have 9 different air-tight containers for any shape and size of dish that I'm cooking, that I can easily throw in the microwave, or the oven, or the dishwasher when I'm done!"
"I've had these tupperware pieces for 2 days and the rubber gaskets (rubber seal that keeps the lids airtight) have fallen off about a third of these tops.  I've looked through these reviews and don't believe this has been mentioned.  Though in the questions the manufacturer does say these gaskets are removable so I suppose this is not a defect, but means I will be re attaching these rubber bands whenever I want to use them.  Will update this review to let you know how this works out.  UPDATE: so this isnt actually as big as an issue as I first thought. I like these containers and frequently use them."
"I took a big leap purchasing this set with no previous reviews so I wanted to make sure to leave the first one. I previously read about the finedine line products and hoped for the best. To my surprise they were just as pictured, sturdy glass and stylish. I decided to do my leakage test and they passed! (See second picture) Very pleased with my new set!"
"I bought these dishes just a few months ago and have used each probably 10 times or less. I wash in the dishwasher and store carefully in a drawer with other glass storage containers I've had for years that don't have a single crack or problem. Every single dish in this collection has cracks and chips all along the sides after basic wear and tear, and one even has a serious crack in the bottom. Very dangerous! I suspect they are made with substandard components and are not tempered. DO NOT BUY! We are past our return date or I'd return them as defective, but just started noticing all the chips and cracks about two weeks ago."
"I can only speak for packaging and appearance at this time but I am please!  It arrived in one piece! They‚Äôre in my dishwasher and I have high hopes!  I‚Äôve grown tiered of buying a new set of plastic containers each year. They stain, discolor, and warp. So this seems like a great alternative.  ***01.05.2020  Great functioning containers. Still happy!"
"These are not durable. Just being stacked caused all of mine to chip, crack, or break. I have had other glass bakeware for years that have never had this issue."
"I thought these would be nice but on the 1st one I opened the seal fell out and the side clip just fell off. It is not air proof SO DO NOT USE THEM TO STORE ANYTHING IN YOUR FREEZER, IT WILL FREEZER BURN. I think these have the potential of being good but they need to improve the quality, I have similar and they are freezer burn safe, they do not have a rubber seal and the clips on the side do not just fall of like these do. I just need to keep looking for a decent quality glass container, I can't use plastic because I have liver cancer and using plastic containers will neg effect your liver and I know my plastics ones like rubber made work better then these and are like way way less money."
"I used my glass containers to carry food to work. Unfortunately, these are not microwaveable safe. In the microwave the glass gets very, very hot while the food heats up to be lukewarm"
"This is a nice container set. I won't buy anything but the glass containers with the real hinges and not those toothpaste cap hinges that will likely snap off after a time, leaving you with a perfectly intact, useless glass bottom. For anyone unsure in looking at the pictures, the color of the hinge tabs is like a light charcoal grey. Not black.  The only beef I have with these is that, while the lids are clear, they're not that clean looking, crystal clear type lid. It almost gives a semi-opaque look to it, in comparison to the crystal clear clean look of their glass bases. For this, I'm still thinking about whether I will keep or return them as, I have some other containers which do have crystal clear lids. Picky but, I feel that the crystal clear lids just make my food look more enticing."
"We love these. They are good quality glass containers with plastic tops that seal perfectly. The locking is cool, too, because it doesn't rely on repeatedly bending and unbending plastic parts like other containers we have. The locking tab just rotates on an axis to open and close. Great variety of sizes and shapes. I'm super happy with this purchase."
"The original set that I ordered was stolen from my porch, but YH-Goods replaced it and even wrote me a personal letter with the replacement. These glass storage containers are fantastic! The lids lock securely and even have a bit of suction. I have washed these containers in the dishwasher multiple times now and the lids are still holding up (though I do not use the heated dry setting). I am very happy with this container set that I am considering ordering them as gifts for my extended family members."
"I loved this product when I bought, the look and the feel of the lids mostly. In a weeks time, I noticed one of the containers had a chipped glass and I assumed it could be me not being careful. In about a month, I have 5 off them chipped at the edges and I am sure its not due to something that I am doing. I have always used hlass contsiners abd this is my first dcoerirnce with the edges chipping and its so risky too."
These are made well in that the lids fit nicely and with out a fight. I have experienced issues on another brand I purchased. I like the variable sizes also. Being glass You can reheat leftovers easily. I am less likely to send food home with a friend and never get my container back.
"Very high quality and durable glassware storage containers! I can put these in the freezer with leftovers, pull them out, release the lid and put directly into the microwave to reheat contents. They fit perfectly in my cabinet due to the graduated sizing that makes them nest inside each other. Even the lids fit in my cabinet right with the containers they go to. The lids fit tight enough that nothing leaks out and being glass, I can put these containers into my dishwasher without worrying that a high temp dry cycle will melt them or cause the lids to stop fitting correctly (lids in top rack only)."
"This is my first glass set of food containers. They are an amazing quality and I could not be more pleased that they were only 40 bucks! I would have easily paid $60 for this set.  As a 29 year old single man, that lifts weights 6 days a week, I needed something that I could store large batches of food, such as rice, beans, and meat, with an airtight seal to keep the food fresh. I also needed something that I could easily put in the refrigerator, freezer, and microwave, as well as transport to and from work. This set does just that. The glass is sturdy enough that it can survive clanking around in my plastic bags when on the go, and is a perfect transition from fridge to microwave, for all my meal prepped food. I have not yet used them in the oven, but I am confident they will perform well.  I have used these in the freezer, microwave, and refrigerator, and the product holds its quality. They are very leak proof which is one of the reasons I purchased them. No more spillage in my truck when the containers shift during my drive. Also they clean up nicely in the dishwasher.  My only minor concern is that the leak proof seal may wear overtime, but so far so good, no problems, so I will see how it holds up.  I can now give back my mom they 400 plastic storage containers that I have accumulated over the years, and all 348 plastic lids that probably doesn't go with the container they are on . (Not quite that many but it sure felt that way every time I opened the cabinet) My cabinets are clear except for this set, and a few larger containers. Very happy with the set, considering buying a second set.  The only recommendation I would add, is that I wish they offered a set with a ""super sized"" container, like something that could hold 2 cups of cooked rice. The problem I have now is that I use multiple containers at once for the same food. If they offered a set with an additional extra large container, I would swoop the set up in a heart beat. Overall excellent quality. Will never ever go back to the plastic storage containers ever again. Glad I found these."
"So I bought these for food storage as a plastic alternative‚Ä¶trying to be health & planet conscious. I‚Äôve never used the dish in the oven before & was curious about whether or not they could be used for baking. So I headed back to the product info & comment sections to check. I saw lots of comments about the lids not being dishwasher or microwave safe! I was surprised because clearly I completely forgot about those instructions & have been using them in the microwave laying atop the dishes (in a venting position) and have put them in the dishwasher - all since I got them a year ago. I haven‚Äôt had any issues whatsoever. No obvious warping or melting. They still fit the dishes, properly locking and I haven‚Äôt experienced any leaking. I have however noticed chipping on the dishes, but that could be because we‚Äôre a little rough in my house and they could have fallen in the sink while hang washing (slippery fingers) or banged into another dish. It is still unclear though how oven safe the glass dishes are, like up to what temperature?"
"It's funny how things go in cycles. Back in the day, we used glassware for storage and the the convivence of plastic took over out world. Now here I am transitioning away from plastic as much as possible. I love these bowls! There are 12 containers with 12 snap lock lids and one of the big pluses for me is that the smaller ones fit into the larger ones so they take up a lot less storage space. Which for me is great because I have precious little space. These are a nice thick glass so I don't worry as much about them breaking. And I already know that going from the fridge to the microwave is safe. Now, are they leakproof? I cannot attest to that, but to be honest, I try not to test ""leakproof"" on anything. The other big plus for me, is that the rubber gasket comes off. So no worries about nasty stuff hiding and growing - YAY! And lastly, I really like the sizes. None are super small (only able to fit a tablespoon of something), and none are too large. These really are the perfect sizes for a variety of leftovers or even meal prep."
"So they DO have that same problem with the seal coming off but I don't mind, I'm not sure it's an issue that avoidable with glass containers of this style. I don't use a dishwasher so I'm not particularly concerned, I think they will last if I take care of them.  They are a bit small in size but it's actually helpful to me as it keeps me mindful of portions. So far I've used the smaller ones much more frequently than I had anticipated.  Other than that, they are pretty awesome! So nice to feel my food storage is truly clean and durable. Definitely an essential and I'm glad I made the purchase. I'm going to say they are exactly what I expected and desired so, 5 stars."
I bought this set because the old plastic ones seem to stain all the time when storing or heating food in them. So far everything is perfect. I was sharing some food I warmed up with my 2 year old granddaughter and when it was all gone she grabbed it from my hand along with the fork and walked away. I thought she was going to put it on the kitchen island but no... she took it and threw it in the trash. That was fun digging it out LOL. All in all I love this set and am so happy I purchased. So easy to clean and no stains or burn marks!!
"I'm all about function, product longevity and easy to clean. When reading earlier reviews saying that the rubber seal falls out on every use, I was concerned about whether this product was a cheap knock off or the real deal. After having used the containers for a couple of weeks, I now wonder if those comments were user error. The seals are easy to take on and off to clean, and not hard to understand how to reinsert if you observe how they are placed in the lids when they first arrive (even if you don't notice the first time, you have a 50-50 chance of getting it right). Can confirm the seals are water tight - I toss them into my bag, where they travel at odd angles for 45 minutes every morning, and they don't leak at all. I also considered buying glass containers that had a silicone net around the outside, to protect the container. Ultimately I am happy I bought these instead, as the range of sizes is more valuable to me than the exterior silicon, and the exterior silicone would be one more piece to clean."
"My cabinet was overrun with hodgepodge plastic storage containers, which included old Tupperware and assorted other plastics. It seemed that none of the lids fit any of the containers, except for the Tupperware. Being concerned about chemicals leaching into my food was my first priority and organization was the second one do I decided to switch to glass containers for storage. When I received my order, I replaced all the old plastic containers with these stackable glass containers that go from freezer to oven to microwave oven. The containers are thick and sturdy, but not heavy, and I‚Äôm so pleased with how organized my cabinet looks plus, it freed up space. I highly recommend these glass storage containers."
"I hate storing things in plastic, so I got these. They seem to be a perfect size for the two of us. Great for storing our leftovers.  There are a couple of smaller containers that are perfect for storing something like a cut up apple or two, or a couple of hard-boiled eggs and half an avocado. The larger ones store quite a bit, but these are NOT the size of the old giant Tupperware containers. YET, there are so many of them, it‚Äôs great to store things in portions and put them in the freezer. I also ordered freezer tape from Amazon so I‚Äôll know what things are. That‚Äôs another advantage to these containers. You can see through them, so your chances of guessing what is in them are better."
"These are wonderful containers with their marvelous air tight lids. They surpass anything I have ever purchased to store food! I love them! They came in so many sizes and I love that! I love that they come in so many colors, too! They go from freezer to ovens with no problem (NOT the lids!) but you can just cover with plastic wrap or a paper plate. I can't say enough about these storage containers. They beat those plastic containers hands down! I would DEFINITELY recommend them and I would purchase them again if I ever need to. There are so many of them that I doubt if I ever will have to!"
"Hubby complained about purchasing containers initially. He now loves them because : the extreme tight seal of lids to the container, the ease of matching and closing lids to containers, how easy it is to reheat left overs in the containers, how fresh the food remains in the containers, the easy clean-up in the dishwasher, and how well they stack in the cupboard. If I'd of known how happy he was going to be with the containers I'd of gotten them for him for Father's Day (just kidding)"
"These are great. Sturdy, easy to see what‚Äôs inside, won‚Äôt leak, and the lids make a satisfyingly solid click when you snap the enclosures. There is a good variety of sizes and shapes in this set, so it seems I can always find just the right size for my needs. The glass containers should last forever unless they are severely abused. The lids probably won‚Äôt last quite as long, but with care they should be good for a decade or two. At least I hope so - I donated all my plastic storage containers after getting this set."
"I am so pleased with this set, I just received them and they are currently being sanitized in my dishwasher so I will check back and up date in Leak Proof.  I was terrified that I was going to get just mangled glass and plastic when I watched my delivery driver pile drive my package onto my porch but they are perfect. The packaging is fantastic and keep everything nice and cozy. The glass ware itself is extremely thick. The quality of these is out of this world. üòç All the gaskets are nice and snug and the snaps seem very durable as well. So far I am extremely impressed and can't wait to buy more of their glass ware products."
"These are fabulous ! My go-to favorite food storage containers. Love that they're GLASS, no more plastic ! So user-friendly, store in fridge, freezer, remove the lid and stick them in Microwave and then straight into the dishwasher !! I use them daily for work lunches. SUPER containers, sturdy and enduring. My son bought me the 1st set and the family has been ""borrowing"" little by little so I'm on my 2nd set! Thanks for a fantastic product that lasts forever. Will be buying them again!"
"Not only do these containers appear to be well-sealed and keep things fresh, but more impressive is that when used to microwave any leftovers, the food will get hot while the glass stays cool. Not sure how this works, but makes removing those piping hot yummies from the microwave so much easier (vs. the usual ""ouch- that's hot- let me grab a towel"" scenario). Would highly recommend."
I absolutely love these storage containers. They are stackable in the refrigerator and take up much less space. Easy to store your food. But I do wash the lids by hand because I don‚Äôt want to remove the silicone sealing rim every time I wash a load of dishes. But it‚Äôs easy to quickly wash each one by hand.
"For the price, quality, and quantity, I can't say that I am upset with this purchase. The lids have a rubber gasket seal that can be pulled from the plastic lid for cleaning, which makes it a little more time consuming to clean, however I think that a little extra time to clean the lid makes up for the tight leak proof seal. These tubs have replaced almost all of the plastic containers we've been using, and as I purchase more long life glass replacements, I will look for similar quality and pricing."
"Trying to be more responsible and use less plastic and more durable reusable materials. These are pretty and nice, and the lids fit wonderfully. I got back a lot of space in my storage drawers reducing down to this set of glass storage containers. Love they do not pick up odors and can just go into the dishwasher without a qualm. I expect to have these for the rest of my life, barring mishap."
"I was looking for something like this for quite some time. Plastic is dated and out for my needs and liking so I turned to glass and am so happy I did, no more stains on the bowl no more mismatched lids they all lock in place securely with a rather nice gasket. These are just the right sizes for lunch boxes and left overs for smaller portions perhaps even a way to cut down the amount eaten at times to not get sluggish after lunch. I will never go back to a plastic set again I am hooked. The lids may be plastic but of a very great quality and durable to my standards."
"These are just what I wanted. We always had giant plastic containers for leftovers that would take up our fridge and never seemed clean. Plus they bent, scratched and leaked. These seem small, but they hold a lot and I love the leak proof tops. One container full of chili fell out, upside down on the floor from the top shelf and it was fine! The lids have locks and a rubber gasket that fits snuggly in its track. They are great for my hubby to take to work since they are the perfect size for lunch, don‚Äôt leak in his bag and clean up fast. Even the plastic lids. They containers stack nicely too."
The care manual confirms that the lids are dishwasher safe and that you can remove the plastic inner ring on the lids for a more thorough cleaning. I hoped they would all fit inside one another but only thr 2nd smallest and first smallest will fit into the largest container at one time. They are durable. I dropped one acxidentally and it didn't break
"This is the most leak proof glass containers I have found. I carry my lunch to work every day. I constantly used to have messes but with these, even soup doesn't leak. They're durable and dishwasher safe which makes my week easier. Easy to clean and durable."
"Arrived within a week of ordering. Box (not the cardboard one Amazon boxes it in) had a little puncture in it, but everything inside was in perfect condition. Handler probably punctured it and not the delivery person. Everything was packaged with safety in mind. Lots of plastic wrap and foam so nothing scratches or clinks together. Love that the gaskets come off for sanitary and cleaning purposes. Good, quality and thick glass material. Did the leak test and it works! Also, we successfully ran it through the dishwasher before we used it. We love our new containers! Cons: 1. the largest container can only hold about 4 cups of liquid. 2. most are stackable for compact storage but lids are not. This is good for a couple, but probably not for a family."
"Like many families, we are constantly running out of storage containers. We have a mix-match of containers, missing lids, missing bottoms, etc. We also decided we'd like to use glass instead of plastic for food safety. These have been in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator and dishwasher multiple times. They are holding up well. We also had tomato sauce in one - this would always stain the plastic containers. No stain with glass. Nice. Oh yeah, the lids latch down nice and tight. I haven't tested to see if they are spill-proof, but believe they would do a nice job at containing a spill."
"I was fed up with plastic food storage options, even the spendy brands. They just don't hold up over time with frequent use. I went looking for glass options, and came across this set. I took a chance based on the reviews and am glad I did. 100% leak proof, cleans up easily in the dishwasher, and seems built to last for the long haul."
"I got these to replace the rubber maid that i have used for some time. nice, dishes and quality , does what it says. It is leak proof. If I have things that will stick i spray it with pam and its no scrub cleaning. very good product"
"I set out to purchase a set of glass food storage containers because I was tired of having to keep throwing out plastic containers once they got warped/stained/scratched. I decided to go with these even though I did not recognize the brand and I can‚Äôt rave about these enough! I pack my lunch everyday, so they definitely get used, and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve gone so long without them! They really are perfect. The sizes are all very practical, they are dishwasher safe, they are durable, the lids are high quality and do not warp/scratch/stain. They have never leaked on me either. Plus the box they arrived in was very well packaged and secure. I would recommend these to absolutely everyone looking for glass food storage containers! Not to mention, the price is a BARGAIN for the quality and quantity you are getting. The glass is thick and durable and they have gone from freezer to microwave with absolutely no issues. As a person who loves cooking, I definitely appreciate and geek-out over any quality, kitchen-related product, and this is absolutely one."
"I cook quite a bit and have used a variety of different storage containers - THESE ARE THE BEST EVER! They work absolutely flawlessly, the food looks great in it. The snaps on the lids are detachable which allows for deep cleaning. The glass is thick and feels ""safe"" (didn't know how else to convey it), easily and beautifully store and they truly are worth every penny! I may buy another set because I need more smaller containers. Good stuff!"
"I wasn‚Äôt paying attention when I bought them. I thought the sizes were going to be similar to a Tupperware set. Instead they are basically medium, small, small, extra small containers. On top of that they are different shapes, so you end up juggling circular, rectangular, and square lids for each of these obnoxious sizes. I know this will be perfect looking for someone paying attention and looking for tiny containers, lol. They seem like good quality though, which I guess I‚Äôll figure out if I use them more. I shredded 5 chicken breasts and had to use 6 containers to store them. I meant to buy a set where the largest size could contain full family meals. Oh well"
"This is an excellent product and value. They are made well and very durable. The pink is just as in the product photo, beautiful light baby pink. I was afraid they might stain but none are stained. I had wash them but my husband puts them in the dishwasher and they come out just as when I put them out of the box the first day"
I decided to get rid of 95% of my plasticware. I was tired of searching for lids and the ugly staining of plasticware. If I stored anything with a red sauce in plastic I would have to transfer it to something glass to reheat because red sauces stain the plasticware so badly. Then DUH! Why not switch to glassware instead. So there you have it!
I just received them so I don't feel that they have really been put to the test. I have not tried to put liquids in them yet so I can't speak to them being leak proof. The lids seem to be of good quality. They are dishwasher safe but I don't think I will put the lids. I think that over time the plastic would become brittle. I wish they were more of a rubber material than plastic but overall I am please so far.
"I decided after years of using Tupperware, that it was time to ""go glass"". I looked a several different sets, and chose this one after looking at many sets. I just started using them, but so far, I am very happy. They are not overly heavy , the lids are secure, and there is a very nice selection of sizes. They arrived perfectly packed. Overall, I think this is great everyday set!"
"I have had these for over a year now, and I have not been disappointed! They nest together nicely, the lids snap on and have never leaked, they're easy to clean, and they're durable. No chips or cracks or melted plastic even when used in microwave (glass only) or dishwasher. They don't stain or melt like the plastic storage containers, and since they're made of glass, no odors are left behind. I don't usually get excited about food holders, but when my daughter was looking for new 'Tupperware', she was super excited to get these instead! I would definitely buy these again! (Although I should never need to!)"
"I absolutely love these containers as they have made cleaning up after dinner much quicker. I was disappointed when I accidentally dropped one and broke it. I have not had any leaks. The one ""problem"" and I use that term loosely, is that one of the latches on one square lid does not close. It is really loose and I am not sure why. However, even with that issue, there are still no leaks. Quality product."
"Love, love, love this set. I have been wanting to replace my plastic with glass for some time. The glass makes so much more sense. They come completely clean, as the plastic stains, you can put them in the microwave, dishwasher and freezer. They stack better than plastic too. I am really enjoying this set!"
"I loved that they are thick glass, the lids fit great, they are very usable sizes and are easy to clean, and are dishwasher safe. I ordered these because I decided (finally) to get rid of all of my old plastic storage containers. These are even better than the big name brand storage dishes I had (and still have) from years ago. So glad I ordered them!"
"These glass storage containers are the bomb!! I love using them for my leftovers and meal prep. I don't use microwaves so this is quick, I'm able to pop them in the oven with the meal ready to go, sometimes i label them. I haven't put them in the freezer yet but looking forward to it."
"Just started using them, so can't speak to their durability. But they arrived unbroken, indicating they're packed well, & the instructions are well-written, showing the company cares enough about its product & image to invest in professional writers. Glass is thick & heavy. According to literature, lids do require a bit of extra care, if you want them to last."
"I ordered a large set of glass tupperware from another brand (not going to name what company as this is not a compare and contrast review) a few months back and loved them...but the clasps on the lid were stiff plastic flaps and I was concerned they were going to snap off with how often I use them. My realization of how much prep I do before cooking (chopping all the veggies, shredding the block cheese, marinating the meat)...I needed way more glass containers than I originally thought. This time I went looking for a hinge lid that still offered a tight seal. I FOUND THEM!! And an added bonus that they came in my favorite color combo, the colors that match the fridge haha. As you can see in the photos, I'm still using the other brand as well, but I love my new ones more and slowly transitioning them around. They nest great, but come with 1 duplicate sized container in each shape that doesn't nest and just sits on top. Seriously...I love these and they keep my fridge looking nice and organized."
"After deciding to be less dependent on plastic, all of my plastic food containers needed to go. Multiple uses left me with stained, scratched, missing, or warped containers and lids. The set of 24 glass storage containers were a perfect choice. The lids snap firmly into place, and the seals are removable. Be aware, that these containers are relatively small and are not suitable for large portion leftovers."
"After a lifetime of using plastic containers I decided to get a set of these. I will never be going back to plastic if I have my choice about it! Plastic absorbs the smells and soaps you use to clean them with, but glass is glass! Is absorbs nothing! The food stays fresh, the seals are amazing, and I have no complaints!"
"I‚Äôve had these since 2019 and I still love them. These are not cheaply made, trust me, I‚Äôd tell you. Well worth the full price but grab these up while they are on sale. The packaging was good and came on time from wht I can remember. These wear well and I put these in the dishwasher."
"FINALLY! A product to store leftovers, especially pasta dishes with tomato sauce, that doesn't require massive scrubbing to remove stains!! That was the main reason behind my purchase. And with the different sizes, I gained an aded variety of options to store leftovers such as side vegetables. I'm so glad to have made this purchase and I look forward to many MANY years of great use."
"I've been using food containers over a decade, I had containers in all shape and forms thru the years. But these are at the top BY FAR !! Pretty solid glass, the plastic lids are also pretty solid, been using them for over a month, my experience is that they are easy to clean and to store. Excelent performance in a microwave and in the fridge. You wont be dispointed. Also had a minor incident with the pacakging ( not related to the product ) and costumer service was great helping me to solve the issue. Recommended 100%"
"I was looking for glass food storage containers and after doing research, decided to order these. They are wonderfully made with nice heavy duty clear glass and tight fitting lids with an inner seal. I have washed both the containers and lids in the dishwasher with no problem. All of the food I used these for stayed much, much fresher than using those dollar store plastic containers. They were well worth the price. The only issue (although the description was very accurate), I would have liked one or two larger containers. I will check to see if this brand has larger ones and will definitely buy them if they do. Oh, and I dropped one and it didn't break because the glass is so heavy."
"Have now bought two of these. I'll take this set any day over the competitors' versions. They put a lot of thought into the design. The latches are well designed so that they won't easily snap off. Most of all, they made it very easy to remove the rubber seal, which makes cleaning the lid and seal much easier. That's important because these kinds of storage containers last longer if the lids can be washed by hand."
"These different size glass containers were a great price and fit the bill on what we needed them for. Container to freezer, then to microwave. The warranty really works‚Ä¶..we broke one and the situation was taken care of ASAP. We were so impressed we bought another set as a gift."
"I really don‚Äôt get the negative reviews on these containers. They are somewhat small, so if you have a big family or have tons of left overs, I‚Äôm not sure it would be right for you. But since I live alone and mostly cook for one, these have been amazing ! I‚Äôm obsessed with them! Microwave, oven, AND freezer safe. nice."
"I've been using them for two weeks now. Heats up food well in microwave and glass doesn't get hot. Lids seal well. I haven't put liquid in them yet so I don't know if they will leak. Some of them will nest for storage. Just remember, lids are not dishwasher safe and I don't put my lids in the microwave. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. I only wish there was a larger size. I'm replacing 15 year old Tupperware and I kept my largest size because it can fit my cut up watermelon. Easy to clean as well."
"Overall I really like this set VS most plastic. The containers are dishwasher safe, however the lids are not."
"The containers are a sturdy thick glass that can be used in the freezer, refrigerator or microwave. There are several sizes for different items.  The only drawback is that they do not stack too well for storage, so take up a fair amount of space."
"I like that these are glass and I don't have to worry about microwaving food in them. The nice thing about this set is that the different shapes stack into each other so it's easier to store. There are two of each in the smallest size, so those don't stack as well, but it's alright. The lids are secure and it's nice to have different size options for different things. I almost wish there was one more set a little smaller than the smallest, rather than two of the smallest sizes."
I threw out every food container that I had when I began using these containers. When I opened the box I thought how small they are and that they would not hold anything. I WAS WRONG! Very deceptive! Loved them so much that I purchased another set!
Got this for my mother as a gift; she loves it. I asked her for some thoughts on it:  Easy to clean Rubber will need to be replaced (I think she means the seal won't last forever) No smell No stain Keeps food fresh for a very long time Let hot food cool before putting the lid on (I'm guessing you'll understand what that means?)  She loves it; asked me to buy her another set.
"I do a lot of cooking and freezing. I've been using quite serviceable plastic storage containers, but I sometimes think I can taste the plastic. Maybe that's in my head, but I decided to try glass. I definitely don't taste plastic."
I have recently fallen in love with glass containers for storage! So much better than those nasty plastic that get stained and look terrible the second you put them in the microwave or dishwasher. I added these to my collection when I finally pitched all of my plastic for full on glass collection....the stress just melted away from having to look at that giant pile of mismatched crap. The glass looks so nice for a long time and the lids actually fit too! The small things when you get older :-)
I love this set! They are perfect for leftovers and they are microwave & dishwasher safe! The only downside is there is a ring around the inside of the lid that occasionally pops out but it‚Äôs not hard to put it back where it belongs!
"I didn‚Äôt believe it when it came that so many containers could fit in one small box, but they do!  Ok first thing that stands out for me is the covers. All the rectangle containers (and there‚Äôs a ton) use the same cover! This is awesome. I don‚Äôt need to have 24 containers with 24 different covers. This makes it super easy to keep organized as well as tidy.  Second, labeling is nice. I appreciate a neat and clean panty so this is great.  Third is the general clean look and feel. These have a nice styling to them.  Finally is the tight seal of the covers. Putting them on, you‚Äôll see how nice these feel. I wanted to use some outside and this makes me feel better about keeping out the elements."
"Fantastic. I need a lot more containers for the house. We have a lot of snack and breakfast items in the house. They go bad much faster than needed and chip clips are just not doing it. When it first came they stacked them so well I was like awww, did I get enough? Yes I did. They come with the cutest measuring scoops as well. If you want to use for baking supplies. I like the variety of them as well. What I noticed with my last set being used for snacks, I ran out of the tall containers very quickly. This has plenty of big ones with also ones very small we used for building a lego castle."
"I love these containers! My kitchen looks so pretty and well-organized, and it's so helpful to be able to open my cabinet and see at a glance which ingredients I need to add to my next grocery order. My package came with a few broken pieces, but I reached out to the seller, and they send replacements (plus extras!!!) right away. I can't recommend these containers enough, and I will definitely be bookmarking this, in case I need more containers to organize the rest of my house now that my kitchen is in order."
"The lids snap closed and seal great. The added labels and marker were an added bonus allowing me to mark, erase and re-mark as needed. The only thing that would improve this set would be to make the canisters so they will stack inside one another to stack and save space when not in use."
I love to organize my kitchen using all kinds of container and I‚Äôm actually amazed by the quality of this product with this sale price. Not only this product comes with many different sizes but also that they are made of great quality of materials and I don‚Äôt need to worry about it breaking or leaking. It also comes with some stickers that I can tape on the containers to distinguish the items stored. I‚Äôm the thinking to purchase another set to organize my living room.
Perfect for pantry organizing would buy again. Received them on time and were well packaged. Great seller.
"Perfect for organizing my pantry! I used my own labels so I‚Äôm not sure how well the stickers work, but I love the rest.  Per instructions, I did need to bend the lid a bit to make it lock, but after doing so, it was airtight and secure. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize that although the bottom parts are different sizes, the kids are all the same size. I personally like that for stacking purposes and easier to sort kids when they‚Äôre interchangeable (except the smallest size container). Would buy again!!"
"Love these containers, they are perfect for my small pantry just what I needed. I‚Äôll be buying more for my large food storage as we‚Äôll."
"My wife and I love the set‚Ä¶however, had a minor issue. I emailed the seller, Fashon-eggs/Chareda, and they responded immediately‚Ä¶and are in the process of resolving.  Very Impressed‚Ä¶will look to them for products moving forward."
"These containers were perfect for our cabinet. Super easy to clean and snap close with ease. Love the different sizes it offers and the lids are all the same size so no need to search for ""the one"". I do wish there was one or two more of the largest one for cereal and noodles but overall really happy with my purchase."
"Great quality. Lids seal very well and they are durable. My only rant would be that they are not stackable WHEN EMPTY. So if there are any not in use they do not store well. It is very difficult to get them apart if you put one inside another. Also, one on my bonus measuring spoons has a hole in it."
"I had nothing but bags that were very unorganized. I like how these stack, labled and so visible. I should have taken a before pic to show the difference these have made."
Love these storage containers!! They are perfect to keep my small pantry organized. So much cheaper than other brands but the quality is just as good. Super happy.
Bought these after redoing my kitchen . Wanted to be more organized. And that‚Äôs just what they did. Loved that there are different sizes and so easy to use.
While trying to pull them apart one of them split. I still have 24 but just be careful pulling them apart.
These are very nice. Clear and sturdy with nice locking lids. I only wish there were a few larger ones for cereal.
Kit contains many different sizes and enough pieces for my needs. I‚Äôm happy with the product.
Doesn‚Äôt get cloudy. My wife loves it. And it pays for itself
Keeps my food fresh comes in different sizes love it
These containers were perfect to get my cupboards organized. Easy to see what is in the container and there is also enough labels to label each container if you so choose.
I like my airtight storage because it's got great quality and selection. They are ready to clean and really good at keeping food fresh!
"I love that all but the smallest two container lids are interchangeable, it makes them so much easier to keep organized! The blackboard stickers are cute too. I don't trust the sizing on the scoops for measuring though, they seem to hold much more than their markings indicate compared to my measuring cups."
It‚Äôs truly air tight‚Ä¶ many lids and I love it
They work great. Seals great and is a great product.
This sizes are medium but there are so many !
Perfect containers. Good quality. Now my pantry is well organized!!
I just love how organized it makes me feel.
Perfect for storing your sugar and noodles
"So far they are super easy to clean, stackable, air tight, and didn‚Äôt smell. All parts came with my order. I can‚Äôt wait to get more to finish my pantry organizing!"
"The crisper is easy to use and comes in all sizes. It's thick and the lid is tight and doesn't leak, making it easy to carry around"
Great for storage
"Good quality, different sizes and reasonable price!"
Not clear as advertised or pictured
Got these to organize my pantry and they work great! I love that they all match and now my pantry looks super organized and clean!
Works great
I was very happy with the storage containers. Only thing I wished there were more taller ones .
Attractive
all canisters have the same size top so all lidsfit all canisters and so easy to stack.
Will be buying more.
Todo me agrado
My order came on time with what was described. Since I have just started using them I cannot tell how long they may last or if they do a good job but so far so good. The quality seems to be there and they made it thru the dishwasher without warping. I like the variety of sizes. I have ordered 3 different air tight storage container sets very recently and would have only ordered this one x3 had I known about it initially due to the smaller size availability. I also like the larger sizes but still use my square ones for flour and sugar.

"I do like this tupperware set as far as quality goes. I thought it was going to be bigger, more for bulk storage, but these are a lot smaller than I thought based on the picture. Better for putting away leftovers in the fridge. I do like that the lids are all the same size and they do work well for leftover storage.  My biggest gripe with this set other than it being smaller than expected is the way it is stored. The smaller containers don't stack together. The bigger containers don't stack together. You have to stack the bigger ones inside the smaller ones like a little tupperware matryoshka doll. Very annoying. Not easy to store all together if your shelves aren't tall enough and you have to take them ALL out if you want a medium sized container put away."
"Lots of containers, various sizes and the majority use the same sized cover! Brilliant!!! The only drawback is the quality. The plastic does not feel sturdy or thick. I imagine this set lasting less than a year. The price is very good tho"
I really like these containers. My only complaint is that one of them came cracked.
Exactly what I was looking for but there was 1 container and 1 lid missing from the pack I'm not sure how but.. 1 short
Wish they would have had more of the larger size. Love the close lock lid.
"After assembling the containers, I found one was missing the lip of it so the top of the container doesn't want to latch. You get what you paid for folks. The measuring cups were cool though."
I love the price for the amount you get although they weren't made very sturdy. I also had one lid that did not want to securely close.
"I was so disappointed these are much smaller than I expected, and my pack didn‚Äôt included any of med/large containers except for the two largest ones. Now I have like 60 leftover containers essentially. üëéüèº"
Would have given 5 stars but one of the containers had small piece broken upon delivery. The lid still closed and sealed. Love the chalkboard labels with the white marker making it easy to wipe with damp cloth and relabel.
"I received my order and some of the tops were already broken. Also, a family size cereal box will not fit in the large containers, had to split it between 2."
I like the products all except for one of my small containers one of the lock pieces was broke off and one of the lids the black rubber piece that helps seal container was messed up. Other than that good deal for all the pieces I got
Did what I needed them to wish it had bigger units could have kept the small ones but pantry look a lot better.
Would have given 5 stars but one container had a broken clasp that closes the lid. It‚Äôs almost broken off just hanging on by a small piece of plastic. Otherwise they‚Äôre perfect and are easy to use.
A good addition to the kitchen to effectively organise and store things
The lids do not close very well. Some do snap shut but the overwhelming majority don‚Äôt. Kinda wish I went with the more expensive ones now.
Some of the lids are warped so the latches dont stay locked. The lids that were not warped work well. Still a good deal. Not the highest quality lids.
I ordered a set before and loved them. This order had too many small containers. I thought I was ordering the same set but I can't find them now
they are not as pictured. not clear. and the set is not the same.
I recd the airtight food storage containers today very excited. I'm An Amazon complainer and dont want this title especially when Amazon has a no return policy for this product. If one of the many people who ave this product high rating could please explain to me how to get the lips to fit so there are airtight I'll be so grateful and will become a fan of this product. I just want the maker of this product or anyone to tell me how to make the lips fit
Great product so far. Just unboxed tho and noticed a couple of the lids are broke. So hopefully wasn't a waste of money...
In no way can these hold a box of cereal or a box of any snack. These are more sized for leftovers and food prep than pantry organization. Tiny!
Missing label kit and one of the 2L containers bottom cracked and unusable
Great containers. Should be packaged better. One of my containers was broken.
Not clear like in picture of item and you won't accept as return. Feel like I've been had.
"Lids do NOT lock on all the way!  Lids have four sides to lock onto Tupperware, and only two of the sides lock. The other two sides always pop off. Complete trash. Buy one of the many other options of this set you can find on Amazon, and save yourself the trouble of having to return these when they undoubtedly will not work."
Doesn't keep food fresh if the side unsnap room for small bugs good for bike parts not food
"These are NOT airtight. I did a simple water seal test before even washing them. I put just a little bit of water in them, light shake, and water was coming out with ease. And the shakes were much lighter than if the containers were in a bag for someone's lunch. If water can leak out with such ease, they're far from being airtight."
Quality is worse than the one they sell in any dollar store or use store
"Update 9/2021: Be sure the lids are centered exactly on the container; if you do that, the lids snap closed easily.  I've been gradually replacing our old plastic containers (some of which didn't even have recycling symbols in them . . . that's how old they were) with glass. This set was just what I needed. Love the glass, and the tops fit really well and snugly. A couple of reviewers mentioned that they had a hard time sealing the lids. I found a couple were a bit harder to close at first; I just closed the three that closed easily, then used both thumbs to push down to close the fourth. All the others are very easy to open and close. Clean-up is easy, and it's nice not to have to worry about chemicals leeching from old plastics. The glass is thick and very durable. Excellent quality at a reasonable price!"
"These are great containers, however it states the glass is BPA free, but doesn't discuss the plastic lids, which is questionable. I bought them none the less and after my very first use I quickly realized these lids lock air tight. That is good and bad, as I couldn't even pry the lid off after unlocking. If you have mobility issues, arthritis or issues with grip/strength these might not be for you. Ive not experienced this before. Fortunately I ran it under hot water and got it off. Do not push all air out when putting lid on, you might not ever get it off. They also require a little force you wouldn't anticipate, to snap on. Otherwise durable and nice, but if you are looking for complete BPA free, it isnt mentioned on package and you may wish to get different."
"So I really like these a lot. I feel my food storage use is better controlled in glass than plastic. I love that they nest together for easy cabinet fit. They also seal perfectly and seem to wash well in the dishwasher too. I so wanted to give 5 stars, but then when I tried to lift the smallest square glass container out of the medium and large one I heard a glass noise. I inspected the piece and found it had chipped on the edge simply by being lifted out of the next size up, I guess scraping the edges during lifting?? I was so excited by this product, and really did not expect this to happen that easily. For that reason only I have had to lower my rating. I am still using and loving the product and hoping that was a one off. I did not bother to ask the vendor to replace the chipped item, although I feel they may have handled that satisfactorily if I had."
"Lids are supposed to be dishwasher safe, but these shrank and do not fit the containers. CORRECTION: I was very wrong about the lids. They have a silicone seal, sit ON TOP of the glass container and makes a leakproof seal once locks are closed. I was wrong thinking that the edges of the lid should fit over the container lip. I wanted to get rid of all my plastic containers that I can‚Äôt use to microwave food because the plastic gets damaged. These leakproof glass containers are perfect. I don‚Äôt need a special lunch container since I can put one in my purse or laptop case, and not have it leak. And they have proven to be microwave, freezer and dishwasher safe. Highly recommend."
"I was surprised they were so heavy but I like that, it means they won‚Äôt break in the oven at higher temperatures. The sizes were a smaller than the pictures so read the specs. I only use glass containers and these had a nice range of bowls for lunch and leftovers. It was an ideal buy. O yes the lids are sturdy not the singular plastic lids these have air lock grips which helps prevent spills. I have these on my ceramic bowls and it makes life easy especially if u carry your lunch daily as I do."
I‚Äôm replacing all my plastic food containers with these. They‚Äôre easy to clean. The lids fit snugly and no spills. I love these containers so much I ordered a second set.
Wanted to switch all my plastic food storage to glass and these were the perfect addition to the sets I already had. I love that there are smaller ones for the portions that aren‚Äôt a big meal. I would say these run from a small/medium to small sizes. I have a couple other sets that have the larger pieces so this was a great addition for everything else we use food storage for. They‚Äôre very nice and I scored mine in an Amazon deal day which made them an even better deal!
"Wonderful and just what I needed! For a lot of korean cooking, it‚Äôs all about the side dishes and this product does such a great job helping me keep my banchan fresh. The various size containers help when I‚Äôm packing some food to my mother‚Äôs and vice versa. A good seal lock prevents any leaks. The glass helps to prevent stains! For the price I‚Äôm very satisfied"
"I like these because you get 9 containers of different shape and sizes: rectangular, square and round. They also nest for storage so the small fits into the large (round in round, square in square etc). The lids are easy to apply and fit snugly. You have convenient sizes based on how much leftovers you have. they are attractive enough to take to work as is, in same containers. I like that they are oven, microwave, dishwasher and freezer safe. No plastic. I haven't got them long enough to check out all the promised features, but I love them so far."
"I love these! Wanted to get away from plastic. My Rubbermaid storage containers are cracking, and I don't even use a dishwasher. I don't trust that they are airtight. I'm now giving those away when I send food home with other people. The glass containers are just what I was looking for but I want a few larger sizes as these are fairly small."
"These glass food storage containers are perfect for storing food. These heavy-duty glass containers allow me to see what is in the containers without having to open up the lids, and the lids are very secure so your liquids don't spill out. One even fell out of the fridge and it didn't break or open up. I will be buying more just to store dry items as well."
"I came on here to initially blast that only 16 pieces came in the box when I ordered 18 pieces. When I pulled up the pictures to attach, I saw that the 3 smallest were nested inside the 3 largest! HAHAHA These are very nice and very sturdy feeling. Heavy glass that will hold up. I just hope the tops don‚Äôt stretch out with wear and tear."
"We love these! My family saves a ton of money buy packing our lunches. With that being said, we‚Äôre pretty rough on them. However, we haven‚Äôt broken one yet! They‚Äôre leak-proof and super durable. Bet part is they don‚Äôt stain and are super easy to clean. I‚Äôll be buying more when we finally lose the kids lol!"
These are very nice - I wish it was easier to just pick a size or shape to order multiples and get the same savings as boxes of multiples sizes and shapes. The lids fit very well but are not difficult to take off. I have put most in the oven and dishwasher - I hand wash the lids because I find plastic lids last longer that way for any brand of food storage. So much better than storing food in plastic ware that can't go in the oven or stains after microwaving.
Me and my mother have a Tupperware war going on for 15 years. We try and still each others glass Tupperware. I bought this set as a gag gift for my mother. I should of bought myself a set cause the new set as set the war a blaze. Maybe I should just buy another set put of respect and love for my mother. Ive stolen 1 piece from mom and its my favorite piece of Tupperware I have. People will understand that love thier Tupperware. Im really not crazy
"Heavier than plastic, like little baking dishes for storage. Lids stay tight. We decided to go this direction after reading about how many microplastics we (Americans in general) are ingesting from the plastic we store things in. THese glass containers are much better for popping into the microwave too."
"I read reviews re trouble people had with these containers and almost didn‚Äôt buy them. Since I‚Äôve had them I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. Easy to use and great way to store food instead of those plastic containers. The lids are easy to put on and get off. Great way to store, freeze, and bake in them. And I wash them by handü§ó"
"Packaging-- perfect. Glass storage-- quality, exceptionally made and heavy duty. Snap on lids fit like a dream (no fighting to get the sides snapped). These exceeded all my expectations. The size ranges are ideal. I'd buy these again, recommend to anyone looking to move away from plastic, give as a gift. Exceptional product."
"For an amazing price I have 9 containers and 9 lids, 3 different shapes and 3 graduated sizes. The lids are easier to apply and remove than the ones I've had like them for years. I have already used 3 of the new containers in the 24 hours since they arrived. I'm very happy with them and with the seller, who got them to me within 24 hours."
"These are very sturdy glass containers with substantial ""lock tight"" lids that seal on four sides. I wasn't aware that the glass is microwave, dishwasher and oven safe (of course, minus the plastic lids), so that's definitely a plus. They came beautifully packed. Very happy with this purchase."
They do what they're supposed to do with my only problem is the rubbery piece that keeps it sealed was defective on a couple of the bowls
"These containers look and feel more expensive than they actually are. The glass feels heavy and the lids are very sturdy. I‚Äôve used them for leftovers multiple times and they save so much room in my fridge and also look really nice. My only issue is that some of the lid clasps are difficult to close, I usually can close 3 fine but then the 4th will give me a lot of trouble. I‚Äôve read other people‚Äôs posts about how the lids must be perfectly centered in order to lock them so maybe I just need to get the hang of it."
"These are great for leftovers and keep the smell tightly sealed and are easy to pop open and closed. Little pricey for the small quantity, but seem like better quality than most for glass bottom storage."
"These food storage containers were bought to replace old plastic containers and I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied. Dish water safe, and they nest for space saving storage. They are of course BPA free, non-order retaining, dishwasher safe and they have have a nice thickness without being heavy. I love them."
I bought these so that I could throw out all of my plastic Tupperware that was missing lids and dirty. These are really easy to clean and they are also oven safe(apart from the lid of course). They are also dishwasher safe and the rubber seal comes out so you can clean it with ease. I would definitely recommend.
"Nice set of storage bowls. Variety of sizes can accommodate most leftovers. Lids fit securely, although they can be a bit tricky to lock down. You'll need both hands. Much superior to plastic and won't stain with tomato based sauces. Overall, well worth the price."
"I was hoping these bowls were a little bigger but never the less it's what I expected, what I need, and serves its purpose. They are thick I haven't used them in the oven I have stored them in the freezer and the lids lock tight. I most definitely recommend and will purchase more soon."
"love them!! these containers are so easy to store because they all fit inside each other and they are very easy to clean as well. i switched from plastic tupperware because of staining and i felt like there was always a ghost of the food you put into the container prior. additionally, being able to heat leftovers in the oven/toaster oven in the same container they‚Äôre stored in is a game changer!"
"I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs recommended to wash the lids in the dishwasher, but I did on the top rack and they have worked fine. Life is too short for hand wash only and dry clean only! This set is wonderful for small amounts of leftovers (2-3 servings)."
"Durable, great product"
I love these glass jars. I have almost eliminated one use zip locks and plastic containers. Great quality and tight seal. They don't take up a lot of space but the larger one will hold 3 chicken breast. The blue rubber has come out a handful of times on some of the lids but very easy to put back on and has not happened consistently.
I received these in perfect condition. Packaging was well done. These containers are very well made and leak-proof. I tested with water. Nice.
"I love these and the sizes/shapes are well balanced so I have a use for each container. My only concern is that the lid sits on top of the container's rim, rather than sitting inside the container which I hope is a long-lasting mechanism. Overall, great glassware."
"We love these bowls so much. When I make goulash or macaroni and cheese, I store unbaked in these bowls for a quick week night meal. They are so easy to clean and store."
"Looks nice, leak proof, but doubt those lids will last a long time. Still so far they provide better sealing power than standard pyrex glass containers."
So easy to clean and dishwasher safe. They are very durable and seal so well. They lock and no worries about the lid coming off. They arrived package very well too. Well worth the money.
"This is a good product. Be sure to check the packaging. It looks like not every item is in the box but they are all there. Some items were inside the other. Also, remember when they say ""18pieces"" they are counting the lids too! So you get 9 glass containers and 9 plastic lids. I assumed that the container plus the lid meant 1 piece when it is actually 2."
"We like the easy storage and the fact that the dishes can safely be used in the microwave. They keep leftovers fresh, and they have already gotten a lot of use. I would definitely recommend these."
I love these so much. I wish I could replace all of my storage where with these types of containers. They seal off completely they clean easily and are much better than traditional storage containers.
"These little glass bowls are perfect to store left overs in the refrigerator, lids are easy on and off. I have arthritis and these are easy for me to use. I do not like using plastic, so these are perfect"
"Good for leftovers, food storage, freezing and microwave. Better than my old plastic containers"
I have purposely tested these by going from fridge to microwave and they have stood up to it. No cracking! Lids are easy to use and clean. Glad I purchased!
Prompt delivery and exactly as described. I especially like these bowls because they can be stacked for storage and the lids are easy to clip on and to remove.
"Just got these today, the quality is very strong, durable, I love the lids and different sizes of the glass containers. I will update my review once I've used them few times."
Given to my mother as a gift. She was so pleased. Much easier to organize than her oddball assortment of plastic containers
I bought these so that I could throw away all my plastic stuff. He will work just fine! Especially love the fact that I can put them in the microwave minus the cover.
"Great seal, and it's removable for deeper cleaning!!! Glass bottoms of storage containers are very thick, thus less likely to break when dropped on carpet or vinyl flooring."
we use this for food storage to avoid plastic storage containers. The lids are washed by hand. I wish the lids were a different color because we have another similar set and the lids are not interchangeable.  The sizes are a good assortment and stack well.
"I got this set in order to reduce my plastic footprint. They do that, although they're a bit clumsy the way they fit together in the cabinet. Plastic containers, actually fit in the kitchen cabinet no better. I gave the old plastic containers to Goodwill"
Exactly the sizes I was looking for. Few of them stack up as well makes it easy to store. The lids close well.
They are really nice. So much better than my Name brand rubber containers. They are easy to open and close so I don't understand some of the negative reviews.
"Love these, they hold up well my son has dropped on floor several times no cracks or chips. Worth the buy"
Trying to get away from using plastic. The food tastes better in these too. You don't have worry about toxic stuff from plastic when microwaving.
"I‚Äôm trying to get away from storing food in plastic, these are my first investment in glass. I think I‚Äôm going to like it! So easy to see the food and best of all no damage to them when you microwave left over spaghetti!"
I am very happy with the quality of these glass storage containers.
"No staining, leakage and durable. I have 3 sets and LOVE them!"
Liked the different sizes and shapes in this set. Came well packaged/shipped
Love these they never scratch up or turn cloudy like plastic containers
"I love these storage bowls. They don‚Äôt leak. Perfect for freezing, microwave, and oven. Storing leftovers or food prepping it‚Äôs great, easy cleanup. It is my go to gift."
I love these containers The sizes are perfect. They look neat and clean in the refrigerator. They also get nice and clean coming out of dishwasher.
Great containers. Get rid of all of the toxic plastic. Heavy duty and food stays so much fresher than plastic containers.
"I love that the glass is thick and the lids are heavy duty. The 3 sizes are perfect! I have some Walmart bowls and the lids all cracked and tore fairly quickly, which led me to these. Great for weekly meal preppers too!"
I have bought two different sets of these glass containers. They are a heavy duty glass and the lids fit real well.
Best Storage containers I have ever had. Recommend them highly
"These do what they are supposed to do. I like that there are a bunch of different sizes. Also the glass cleans off easily, with stuff like chili that can make plastic storage container discolor or smell. Good product, good value."
"What I liked best? Glass, not plastic!"
These are great. Easy to use and store nicely. Better than expected. So much better then plastic!
"Tops take a little getting used to in terms of sealing but so far it has worked. I like the clean, chemical free glass containers."
"So far so good, had these for a few weeks now and love them. Threw out all the old stuff in the house and embraced the glass wear!"
I really like these containers. I plan to purchase more in the future.
"Lots of reviews mentioning the rubber was stuck to the glass. In my box, the rubber rings came in a plastic bag, so this was not an issue for me. I wasn‚Äôt purchasing this product for thick glass, so if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, this may not be for you. All jars do the trick. I just wish I had the option of purchasing 3 of the smaller sized ones from this specific brand. (Labels from Etsy)"
Containers arrived packaged extremely well. Very well made product: glass container and the bamboo lid. They come with chalk sticker and a pen to create labels. I would highly recommend!
"These are so beautiful! I bought two sets. I received my first and couldn‚Äôt wait to wash them and put them on display in my cupboard. I also ordered some minimalist stickers for labeling each container. Very pretty touch! I don‚Äôt know what people are talking about saying the glass is thin. No way! It‚Äôs thick glass, and mine arrived in perfect condition and boxed to protect the glassware. Also the rubber suction on the lids holds tightly. You have to insert the tips of the rubber into the circular groove on the lid for it to suction properly. ;)"
"First order all containers were in good shape except for one of the lids that had a little piece of wood broken and would not be able to close properly. I called Amazon and they were amazing, they ordered a replacement and I was able to exchange the damaged lid but one of the big containers from the replacement order was destroyed when it arrived.  Have in mind that there is a chance you might encounter something similar. However, they helped me and I was able to get what I needed.  I love them and will keep the good set and exchange the broken lid. I will be returning the broken set.  Has good thickness. They are not heavy. They seal pretty good."
"I live in a tiny apartment and my counter/drawer/cabinet space is precious. I'm also Italian and I have about 20 different kinds of pasta all over my place, I bought these specifically to store my most used pastas on the counter and it works beautifully. The tallest jar comfortably fits angel hair, Alfredo/linguini with room to spare. They're not super heavy and the tops have a great seal on them without also being super heavy duty.  I love them, I can't wait to see them on counters that aren't cluttered with all the other things I have no storage space for."
"I am picky about my glass containers. I was worried it was going to be cracked or broken. After my throughout inspection. I am satisfied. No cracks, just some minor scratches on the outside of the glass. I was surprised it came with a little white marker to write on the glass. I'm happy with the purchase."
"I love these jars for my dry goods. I use in my pantry. They work great since they come with a silicone seal around the lid to keep things fresh. I've had for over a year and nothing has broken. I have NOT put this in a dishwasher though, I don't think they would withstand a dishwasher. I hand wash and air dry."
"These jars ARE airtight, you have to place the silicone ring properly. They are cute, functional, and the sizes are perfect! They are made with thinner glass, so I won‚Äôt be putting these in the dishwasher. The smell is from the bamboo, that‚Äôs just how natural bamboo smells. Give it a good ol‚Äô was before use and you‚Äôre good to go!"
I have only put solids in the jars so I can not review whether they are leak proof. I do love how sleek and stylish they are.
I like the seals though it would be nice if I felt the seals used were a bit sturdier. Thus far they work well and I would buy them again. The price is great and they are much better than most glass storage containers.
"These are great for storing all sorts of grains/snacks/spices! You're gna need more than 5. The tallest one will fit spaghetti, but the other ones probably won't. They fit a lot more than it looks, great for keeping the kitchen. But the glass does feel a bit on the thinner side, so probably would try and be careful."
"I loved my first set so much I ordered a second one! There‚Äôs one in my pantry and one on my counter and both look so much neater than random half-opened packages. They‚Äôre easy to clean, the seals work great for freshness, and the various sizes are perfect for whatever we want to hold. Highly recommend."
"They are so cute and easy to store! They hold so much stuff and I love how their all different sizes. The lids are a wonky to get on sometimes, but a very minor issue (it‚Äôs really nothing I just thought i‚Äôd mention it)"
"My wife was looking for secure storage for her rice, beans and flour. These were perfect because they are air tight and seal the freshness in. They are easy to clean."
These are the first thing everyone notices in my pantry. Good sturdy product. The rubber seals are wonderful. I love how nice and organized my pasta is now.
Oh my they add some real class to my coffee station..again..i have haters! They HATE they didnt find this before me
"They look really good. Perfect size for spaghetti etc. The silicon on the lids make it snug enough for dry foods, not sure I would put cookies in them- I haven't tried it yet for freshness though. The lids are exactly the light bamboo color shown. They did not smell either and cleaned up nice."
"Gift for granddaughter. They look great and the seal is quality. She has not received yet, so do not have a complete review."
Finally cleaning my pantry and this made organizing much more pleasant. Bamboo top seals well with glass bottom. Would recommend to buy.
I love the jars for kitchen organization. I did notice the lids had a strange smell but I washed them in dish soap and let them air dry. The scent went away. Love how they look. Also come with labels.
Great price and quality. These look so great in my pantry just hope I don't break them!
These are airtight and easy to clean! Love the look of these in my kitchen!
"These were bit bigger than I expected, both taller and wider. But, they are great. The glass itself could be little thicker. Also, you have to add the seal/rubber stopper yourself. I like that it comes with the labels and chalk marker as well, nice little bonus."
"I ordered 2 sets, all of the containers came perfectly packaged. No scratches nor broken glass. But the glass it self dose feel very fragile!!"
The product was awesome! There are several reviews complaining about the rubber being stuck buuuut mine cape in a separate baggie for me to wrap on the lid myself so that was really cool and it comes with cute sticker labels and a white marker. Spaghetti fits comfortably in the tall container. Already buying more!
The containers look great and seal nicely. I‚Äôve had them for a few months. I use mine in the kitchen for dry goods and in the bathroom for q-tips & cotton balls. The glass feels a bit more fragile/thinner than I was expecting. When I opened them my first impression was these will shatter if I squeeze! So far they have held up very well & I love them!
I choose these because they were a more eco friendly option for food storage.. They have a rubber seal to keep foods fresh and are light weight but sturdy. I also love how great they look
"I ordered these for many reasons. Food storage for the larger ones and sourdough starter for the smaller ones. They're perfect! The tall one isn't quite tall enough for spaghetti, but there's plenty of other uses for it. I'm pleased."
Gorgeous chic look. They could be a Little thicker But I love them and would definitely more.
Suction is good. Jars are made well
It fit perfectly in my kitchen. I have a small apartment so storage is everything.
My wife loves it
These containers are nice quality and seal well. They look sleek and modern. I'd buy them again.
"Really great quality had an affordable price. Use them to hold nuts, candy and treats."
"Fast service, great product for the money!"
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about these. I want to get another set. Perfect for in the pantry or displaying on your counter.
"Beautiful, adds such organization to my pantry! Sleek, uniform design. A touch of mid century mod feel with the bamboo lids!"
"These are beautiful and work wonderfully in my kitchen for all of our storage needs. The labels they come with don‚Äôt match, which is a bit odd, but we just left those off. The jars are lovely :)"
I really loved it. Value for money is fair.
"Love my glass containers, I use them for snacks, they look perfect over the counter!!"
"Los tarros quedaron perfectos en mi despensa. Tienen capacidad para un paquete de pasta de medio kilo, dependiendo de la forma de la pasta.Incluyen pegatinas y bol√≠grafo de color plata para nombrar cada tarro."
For the price these are a great value. Love the look!
"Beautiful, sturdy product. Tight fitting lids. My only complaint is that, to my knowledge, they cannot be bought individually. I don‚Äôt need another canister for spaghetti, but I could use several more of the 2 smaller ones."
Work all the money. Loved the different sizes it came in and the lid is nice and tight in there.
Son grandes se ven hermosos en mi cocina
Excellent quality. The food grade cover seals is a very nice touch.
Really good value! I love the look of the clear glass and wooden tops. There were reviews about the seals being glued and ripped when opened - they did not come like that for me. Really nice looking.
Love these! Made my pantry organization dreams come true. I'll definitely be buying more as I need them.
Great product looks nice and fits a lot
They love it
Love these! Exactly what I needed and wanted! Product doesn‚Äôt disappoint
"Those jars are exactly what I was looking for. Nice glass jars with tight fitting Bamboo lids. Took one star off because of 2 little issues: 1- one of the jars has imperfections (like etched glass marks) towards the bottom. 2- several of them had part of the rubber seal stuck (like glued) to the glass inside the jar. I was extra careful and was able to peel it off the glass (and scratch the residue off the glass), but if I had opened the jars normally it would have ripped off that seal. After that initial peeling however, I haven't had this issue reappear, and the lids offer a nice airtight seal.  I would definitely buy them again."
Super cute and seal nice
Just what I was looking for
"These jars are not only far better quality than I expected for the price, they are attractive as well! Definitely worth the purchase price."
Well made and super fun to decorate with.
Very nice glass containers.
"The product and I am using them to store dried fruit, seeds/nuts, beans/lentils, and pastas. Wonderful to it on oatmeal, salads and beyond."
They are gorgeous and packaged amazing!
I use this product on my kitchen counter and it is Gorgeous!! Beautiful and elegant look and the jars are so easy to use!
Great product and as shown
Storage jars are just as pictured. Looks great and is aesthetically pleasing
Product arrived cracked
"I like because save space have a good side each, thanks"
"Absolutely love it!! Great price, great product! Will order another set."
Perfect storage in pantry
It's good for the storage of food!!
I was afraid they would be small but they are a lot bigger in person and the packaging was organized nothing broke.Absolutely would recommend them because am getting more
Exactly what I was looking for to organize my pantry
These are perfect for no waste kitchen use. I wanted to organize my counters and pantry and these were just the thing I needed.
"I purchased the 7 piece set of food storage containers and I noticed a few scruff marks on two of the lids. Other than that, I was happy. I sent an email to Vtopmart support and they got back to me pretty quick and offered to send two containers and lids to me at no cost to me. I have nothing but great things to say about this company and this product. I love love love it!"

"I love the clean look. I need larger ones for flour, chips, cereal etc. I have had them for awhile now and several of them have started cracking. Now the hinge to lock the ""air tight "" lids are breaking off. Believe me, it took me a long time to decide to spend this money to purchase and they are just past the return date. I am very careful with them and the money I spend. I would not recommend them."
"I got this for my wife for Christmas. I have a tendency to give her things that are really more for both of us, and she's been upset in the past because of this.  Our pantry was in complete disarray, even though I organize it ever few months the best I can.  With these new food containers, things are already much better and I haven't even reorganized yet!  Quality is great here for the price and the sizes of the various containers is good. We love the tall pasta container, and by itself, I think it's more than half the total cost here, so adding in 6 more containers is a very solid deal.  We haven't used all the small containers yet, but 1 has bubble gum balls in it, and there's plenty more candy around the house we could throw in.  The closure systems/lids are very nice...super easy to use and very solid feeling.  Al in al, we are both very happy with this purchase/gift."
These are not 100% airtight. I put water in there and flip it and the water started to leak. Not worth the price.
They work like a dream. Made my messy cupboards bearable again. Only problem is I need more üòä.
I LOVE these containers. I've had several brands of storage containers including the pop tops and these by far are my favorite. They are easy to open (just lift the loop and it opens) and then are sturdy. Amazon had them for a great price compared to other retailers. They also shipped and arrived super quick and came with labels and a chalk marker. My suggestion is to write on the labels and let them dry for a few minutes before applying to the containers themselves to prevent smudging. My young kids have no trouble opening and closing the containers which is a definite plus for me. I ordered three sets for a pantry project and plan on getting more in the future.
"They are crystal clear and the lids fit like a dream with a positive air lock. I've had crackers stored for about 10 days and they are still crispy and flavorful. It's been very humid here and our pantry has gotten quite warm as we have no A/C and very uncharacteristically hot weather. But even this hasn't mattered as all the contents are fresh as the day they were put in - even the brown sugar - no lumps!!! I love the ease of opening, no tugging around the edges, just a snap up of the lid 'button' to open. I would absolutely order more and recommend to others. I've already told both my daughters about them. I'd like a few more size options for things like flour and pasta - items that require shorter wider containers."

Bought our first home & wanted to rid my pantry of all the ziplock & rubber banded chip & cookie bags! Tired of things going stale quickly & the mess. Researched a few more well known brands & decided to go with vtopmart after learning they redesigned their pull top/air locking lid. So glad I did! They truly work! No leaks upside down & can‚Äôt pull off the locked lids at all. Husband is thrilled because he can just grab his snacks in a nice container without dumping into another serving container & I‚Äôm happy because things actually get sealed up nicely! Win Win! I did give 4 stars for easy to clean-NOT dishwasher safe & lid is difficult to clean. But company sent a card to register containers & give lifetime warranty! Can‚Äôt go wrong! We bought several more‚Ä¶I think $200 worth should do us for now ;D BUY THESE!
"My wife used to use old wooden canisters before the kitchen was remodeled . After the new kitchen was finished the counters were left bare , all the staples went in different cabinets and never were in the same spot twice . I saw these while perusing the ""Deal of the Day"" items so I figured I would try them out . When they arrived I set the box on the counter and let my wife find it , I could easily return it if she threw a fit . To my surprise she thought they were nice looking and needed . After a trip through the dishwasher (lids on top rack to protect the seal) we filled the main staples and then used the extras for other things we like and use often . I am so pleased I don't have to go on a scavenger hunt to find sugar or flour anymore and I don't have messes from flour or sugar bags spilling in the cabinets . If you don't have cannisters or want to replace an old set I recommend these 100% ."
"I‚Äôm not sure how necessary these are‚Ä¶ but I LOVE them! I store uncooked noodles, snacks, cereal, uncooked rice, croutons, etc. in these. I feel like my pantry is more aesthetically pleasing and definitely more organized. These stack well with each other and save me space from oddly shaped boxes and bags I would have in my pantry without them. I don‚Äôt really know the benefit of having ‚Äúairtight containers‚Äù but I love the organization it offers and the food I store never tastes stale. For foods that need to be cooked (noodles, rice, etc.), I wrote the basic directions on the black stickers. I also used the stickers for the expiration dates of the food I store. I throw the containers in the dishwasher and clean the lids by hand. I‚Äôll definitely be getting more in the future!"
I love these airtight storage containers. They fit together well and a generous number of containers are included for the price. I haven‚Äôt started using all of mine yet but I both the counter and in the fridge they are exactly what I wanted to maintain freshness for my supplements and dry goods. I can open and seal them closed with one hand effortlessly. I like the included label stickers and chalk marker but the chalk marker is going to smudge off if there is moisture on your hands. I‚Äôll likely use my label maker just to keep that from happening or cover with clear tape after writing.  It should be noted that disassembling the lid does require a bit of coordination and the ability to apply downward force while also slipping the locking mechanism in place. I wanted to wash them fully before first use but don‚Äôt see myself doing more than wiping down the outside of the lid as needed going forward.
"I was worried, having read so many one-star ratings, that these containers would arrive damaged or displease me in some way, but they're perfect for my need. I like the fact that they are square, so they fit perfectly on my counter against the wall, while if they had been round, that would have taken up more room. I don't have much room in my pantry cabinet, so I need to keep some bulk items on my counter, like flour, sugar, rice, muesli, salt, and legumes of various kinds. I'm not going to use the labels for the time being because it's obvious what's in them, but it's a nice touch. Very pleased!"
"I bought two of these sets when they were on sale and so far I love them! They‚Äôre easily stackable in my pantry, and I set the labels high on them so they can be read when stacked with smaller ones in front of larger ones. I just got them so I can‚Äôt speak to their air tightness right now, but they did feel fairly secure when I was putting the lids on and shutting them. I do also like that the lids can completely come apart for cleaning. The plastic is very see through and not opaque which is why I bought these ones. My only wish is that they were a tiny bit bigger (like 4x4 or 5x5) but for what I paid I love them. It‚Äôs so nice to get all the random different boxes and bags down into nice streamlined containers!!"
"I've purchased this set a few times now for all the bulk foods I buy at Winco. They work great and look sleek in the cabinet. I love that they stack. I wish there were sets of just one size though. I'd definitely buy more of the smallest and second largest size solo because they fit nicely on my shelves with no wasted space. The second smallest size is too big to stack with my shelf spacing, but had wasted space since it's shorter than the shelf. The smallest size can stack two high in that space better.  Also customer service is amazing. I had a container arrive cracked and they replaced it as soon as I notified them of the problem."
"These are the perfect touch to add a homey feeling to the kitchen. The kids are well made and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to take them apart to clean. You just remove the lid, push down on the lid and the big spring allows the little notch to be exposed and you slide the little plastic top off. They are well made and the little stickers are cool. Not real chalk, but a white marker on black which looks like chalk. Love them. Might make a really great gift."
"So far so good! I have some OXO containers that I LOVE but these were so much more reasonable. I've had them a couple weeks- things are still fresh- I LOVE the labels and they are comparable to my oxo containers for half the price. I went to Wal-Mart to purchase something that looked EXACTLY like these but as I was picking them up by the lid, the lid slipped right off (so much for air tight). This brand is the real deal. I will be puchasing more when they are back in stock. They made my pantry look so pretty and organized! Here's the bonus- they offer a lifetime warranty and send you coupons for future purchases."
"This product came exactly as described & as I hoped it would be. Looks great, very durable & high quality, & definitely helped me to organize my cupboards & counters. An overall great value!üòä"
"I have been using these for dry snacks like Cheez Its, cookies, cereal etc., and they are wonderful. They are air tight so my snacks last longer and the covers are super easy to put on and take off so my 7 year old is able to take the lids off and put them back on correctly himself. They are easy to clean and they make my cabinets look so much more organized which I love. I would definitely recommend these containers."
"I really like these containers. I looked at several competitor brands before deciding on these. Why did I choose these over the others that I looked at? Unlike many of the competitor units, the lids on these can be easily disassembled for cleaning!  Most of the ones similar to this, you cannot wash the lids because they will get filled with dishwater and there is no way to disassemble them. These, however, can be easily disassembled so that you do not have that problem.  I only wish they were available in larger sizes."
"This product was brought as a gift and originally the box came dented up and 2 of the containers were broken. Customer service had a new package delivered to my house in about 24 hours. I had received it Sunday, dropped it off at UPS around noon Monday once i saw it was broken, and a new one was at my door around 3pm Tuesday! This is excellent customer service! Now to the product review: the feel of the containers is soft and sleek but sturdy. Will be a great addition to a counter top or pantry space. I ordered the white ones as a gift for a coworker. I tested the tops and you can literally hear a small gust from the air tight seal. The products in them will stay fresh for sure. Will update on this review as she uses it more"
"Rarely are you able to get something of quality in a decent or high quantity. With this product, you get both. We don't have a pantry so we built a pegboard shelving unit and use these canisters to display and store a large chunk of our dry goods (although they are fairly empty at the moment thanks to the holidays.) I have purchased many products from this brand and even given them as gifts. Love!"
"I have ordered various VTopmart combinations of these containers multiple times from amazon to create a clean, organized pantry space. I just now had 1 of the lid pieces break for the first time after almost 2 years of using them. It was not daily use, but mostly once a week or monthly (depending upon what was in it). The plastic lid handle snapped and broke without much force. They've never been put through the dishwasher, always washed by hand. Durable and nice to look at!"
"By I only wish I had the money to buy many many more of this product. It is easy to use, in fact all the food storage containers I have purchased this is the one! I will continue to buy this product as the money affords.  The only suggestion I would make to the manufacture, is with the same easy lids I would have a larger container for flour, rice, pasta, sugar, packaged snacks etc."
"Love, love, love these! I have so much more counterspace switching to these storage containers. The stacking ability, see-through design, and labels included make them invaluable. I love the lids for ease of opening when working with ingredients. Highly recommend them (I bought 2 sets right away.)"
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited but when she got home, 3 containers were cracked. I contacted the awesome customer service, sent pictures of the cracked containers and they immediately sent out replacements! My daughter reported the containers have worked out great and she loves them."
I‚Äôm a bit of a neat freak and wanted my kitchen shelf to look neat and put together because it‚Äôs open for all to see. The containers all came in perfect conditions. I did was before use and saw no issues. The stickers are great to label things. They sent so many stickers I ended up using some for other things with lots left over. Will definitely buy again if I need more in the future.
"I love these Airtight Food Storage Containers. Keeps everything in your panty looking nice and organized. The labels are easy to change out due to the chalkboard-like pen, and they stack nicely on top of each other creating much more panty space. Keeps everything fresh."
"I've been buying different storage containers, and these are the best by far. They're the best by far. The airtight seals are easy for arthritic elderly to open and close. Food stays fresher in these containers. They are worth EVERY penny."
"When I received my original shipment, a few of the containers were broken. No fault of the company, but more likely just the shipping process. I reached out to the company, and they were incredibly communicative and helpful. They shipped a completely new package right away. The containers are great!"
Love the way these look but a little smaller than I had thought they were going to be. I still like them though and love how they keep the food in them fresh. They seal quite nicely. They make my pantry look a whole lot better in the containers than in boxes and bags.
These were perfect for what I needed! Wish I could find cereal sized ones as well so I could have the whole set! My only tiny teeny quibble is that you can‚Äôt fill them completely full due to the lid needing space. But that‚Äôs just splitting hairs really. These work perfectly!
I have had OXO brand and needed more storage. These work just as well and are a better price than my previous brand. If there is a draw back is that there aren't as many sizes. But for simple storage for smaller flours or baking goods these are perfect.
"I've been able to get organized. I love the look of my stuff not tossed all over and stuffed into the shelf. As you may see in the picture, I was able to put the spaghetti box right and have loose from another box inside also. Now everything has a place. I'd recommend and buy again."
Unfortunately I got them as a gift for someone so I don't have any pictures. They said that they loved them and that they are the perfect size for everything she needed. I am thinking of reordering for myself when I get the chance. Would definitely recommend this product.
""
"These were better than I expected, especially for the price. I store anything from keto fat bomb, cheese chips, cookies....ok ok, all my snacks! I even have some of these containers in the freezer and they work great! Great buy!!"
"These are great food storage containers. Comes with labels for you to mark contents and dates. Could have had fewer small containers in set. Used larger ones and ended up storing smaller ones. Containers are good quality and have great seals. We use them for pastas, flour, sugar and other cooking products. Makes organization easy and pantry much cleaner."
I think these are a nice product to have. Maybe a little cheaper than I expected & some of them were smaller than expected but overall I‚Äôm really happy with the purchase of these. Also comes with stickers and a white marker for labels
"I shopped for a bit to find a good set to store my dry goods in my newly organized kitchen pantry. These do the job. The plastic is a little thin and one had a crack on the bottom when I got them, but so far no issues and it's not storing liquid so it will be fine. They're easy to clean though it's a shame the lid cant get wet but I'll make do. All in all I'm satisfied with my purchase and for the price it's a good set."
"I have ordered different models, they are mostly all the same I use them both for dry and refrigerated storage Would love the option to buy individually by size if any company could do that I have dishwashed, but now recommend hand wash Always in use in my house!"
They are airtight was skeptical since I had ordered better homes and gardens ones in past but these are just as good if not better. I can see what's inside and also has stickers to write content. Would purchase again.
"El paquete que ped√≠ era de 7 envases, y de los 7, 3 me llegaron quebrados.  Edit:  Me contact√© con los vendedores y me enviaron otro pack de envases. Fueron muy amables y r√°pidos al solucionar el problema.  Les hab√≠a dado dos estrellas porque llegaron quebradas, pero por la buena atenci√≥n, amabilidad, y rapidez al resolver el problema les doy 5 estrellas.  Pd. Ya llevo 5 meses con los envases y todos siguen en perfectas condiciones, s√≥lo uno se me ha quebrado pero fue mi culpa ya que se me cay√≥."
"I wish I had given these canisters a try before now. I spent twice the price on OXO pop-up ones that are almost exactly the same as these. I see very little difference, in fact these are superior in that they are easier to clean. Brilliant buy. High quality! These even came with labels and pen! Those are extra for OXO. I wish I could buy a different variety of sizes in this brand, but I am very happy with them so far."
"I purchased airtight containers before and needed a few more. Easy to see what you stored in them. They keep those tiny, tiny ants out of your food storage. Easy to clean and stack nicely."
"I am obsessed with these containers! They are stackable, they did great in the dishwasher, I have dropped them and the top hasn't popped off. They are SO much better than the button top containers, and I love that the handle clamps down in either direction for ease of use. They look great on my counter!"
"Easy to keep clean, exactly as described, I love the fact you can write your own description on it. Only thing I would change is being able to erase and write again on the same sticker. It‚Äôs hard to remove and leaves a sticky film. When you try to erase what is on there you can‚Äôt fully. So just keep using it for the same thing or put another sticker on top."
"These containers were a great find!! They washed well, they seal well and look good in the cabinet when full!! Planning on ordering more soon! ps.. not sure if they are 'leak proof' since I don't have liquids in them.."
I just re did my pantry and used these containers for all my pastas and snacks. They look super cute and the quality are great! They are comparable to the really expensive ones at Target. Very happy with them!
Great price for sturdy airtight organizing containers. Have bought 2 sets so far and won't hesitate to buy more as I need them.
"I just love these! They add such a clean organized look to the kitchen. It came with instructions on how to disassemble the lid, which I couldnt really figure out. But other than that, they get the job done, and they're durable. I waited to give my review until after I let my husband(who is a bit clumsy) use them. Even after he dropped them...a few too many times, they still look good as new. No change in quality!"
They were easy to clean. And top was an excellent airtight seal for these containers. I like the fact at a quick glance I can see what is in the container. In the near future I will order another set.
"I absolutely love these!! I must be dumb, but I had to get my husband to show me how to open the containers. But now we have them in our kitchen and all labeled.. definitely worth the money!!! Just be sure to make sure the lids are pushed into the containers completely to keep products freshest."
pantry storage. on shipment i small canister had a crack on the bottom. was not a problem. i emailed the co. to tell them they might have a quality control problem. they thanked me and sent me an unexpected another set trully a professional co to deal with
"I ordered the set of containers and loved them upon arrival. The chalk pen works well and the chalk labels are cute and easy to affix. When I was washing the containers, I noticed one of them had a large speck stuck in-between the layers of plastic, so I contacted the seller. They were AMAZING. They answered my email quickly, promised to send a replacement and then included a bonus. I so appreciate the time they took and the way the dealt with my issue. Love them and great containers too!"
"I had a question about the product and sent an email - they were super helpful and responsive. They are perfect for kitchen storage for our Pasta, rice, pumpkin seeds, spices, etc.  Super happy with this purchase."
"I love this! The small canisters are not too small, great for my seeds. The different sizes are kinda perfect sizes for my different needs. Slightly difficult to clean at first but once I got it, it's really easy. Great freshness. Yeah, love this product."
"I love these. Previously I had glass jars with metal tops and I couldn‚Äôt ever keep them clean. These are so perfect. They stack in all kinds of ways and hold tons of ingredients. I have tea, rice, flour, sugar, pasta, bread crumbs, corn starch and more in mine. So handy to have all these right where I can grab them instead of having to dig through cabinets. Super durable and look great too!!"
"I emptied out the pantry and reorganized with these wonderful containers. I liked them so much I ordered more the same day! The chalkboard labels are handy. I smile whenever I open the cabinet now. Plus, one container was scratched and the company quickly sent out a replacement. I strongly recommend."
"My order came in incomplete with 2 cracked containers and no labels or chalk pen The company worked and corrected the situation promptly The containers seem well made and sturdy! I have not used them yet so can not review on the strength or how long they last! They have a nice clean look to the containers and good for storing nuts, croutons, spices, snacks‚Ä¶"
"These storage containers were exactly what I wanted and needed. Taking apart the lids to clean was a bit weird, but I understand that is what gives them the airtight seal. My only issue is now that I have one set, I need at least one more, because I keep finding things that could go in them!"
I bought these for my new refrigerator to keep fresh chilies as fresh as possible for my husband. He loves them! The food stays fresh for much longer than expected and he has raved about how great they work. (He never did that before.) I found them easy to clean and they look great in the refrigerator. Very tidy and organized. I am thinking about getting another set....for me!
"I ordered this set for the coffee bar in my craft/sewing room. They really work well. A 12 oz bag of ground coffee fits in the next to the largest containers. I keep sugar, individual creamers and tea in the others. You really can get the top off and on with one hand.:"
"Perfect set of containers for our variety of baked goods. The airtight lids are easy to disassemble for easy cleaning. It came with 3 sheets of vinyl labels and a little chalk marker, which wipes away easily with a damp cloth. In one of my pictures, I have all but the tallest in our store brand cubby shelving unit (cubby measures 11""x11""). I did test out the taller container, it fits into a ikea kallax cubby (13""x13""), fyi!"
My containers had bugs inside and it was look like somebody returned it. It wasn't look like new. so I contacted customer service and they gave me replacement. I'm happy about their customer service.
"These seem well made and they seal very well. They‚Äôre also super easy to use. The test of time will tell all, but initially they seem great."
"These containers are very airtight and durable in The dishwasher. For the price, it is definitely worth having in your home. I use it to store everything"
"I seen where some people said water stayed after washing. But if you take it apart to wash it as instructed, let it dry or dry with paper towel prior to putting back together there should be no issues.  This product is worth it in my eyes."
"Would‚Äôve liked a couple more tall ones, but these hold cereal, dog treats, dried beans and spaghetti great. Lids are easy to seal and open."
"I am in the process of replacing all my storage containers with these. I cannot say enough good things about this product! These containers go from dishwasher to freezer storage without any issue. Started with a sample set to test whether they would bubble up in microwave or stain as I cook alot of red sauce pasta and barbecue. They have past every test with flying colors. Go from dishwasher to microwave, then to frig and freezer with ease. These have not stained, bubbled(whitened) and hand washing or dishwasher- it doesnt make a difference because they clean up great! These are mine and I now send out all my other containers with family. My family thought I was joking--- in order for them to take one of these containers out of my house i require a deposit because they are that high quality!!!! Exceeded all expectations and I wish I would have bought these sooner. The best all around storage container I have ever used! Love them!"
"I've had these a little over a year and still look like new. They are the best ever. Cost more, but worth it. The rubber seal around the top is tough. These are cleaned in the dishwasher regularly. They are good in the microwave (with lid off). And freezer too. Leak proof and hold in odors, onions, celery. Forgot to get one out of fridge, and when I opened it, omg stink. I cleaned it in dishwasher and no smell. The odor doesn't go into the plastic. I would spend a little more and get these instead of the cheaper ones I used to get. Saved money, not having to throw away ruined food savers."
"There is nothing to dislike about these containers. They are airtight, spill-proof, and stackable. And the best part - they don't stain or get pitted. I make large batches of tomato sauce and freeze it to use throughout the month. These containers hold over 3 cups of sauce, stack nicely in my freezer, and reheat easily in the microwave. The best part though is the condition of the containers. They just don't stain or get pitted from the sauce. Tomatoes are tough on plastic and these are amazingly tough. I've had my set for over a year and as you can see from the pictures, they look brand new, unlike the old plastic containers I've used. Buy these. You won't regret it."
"I seem to have acquired a collection if Rubbermaid Brilliance, and with good reason. These are the very best for keeping my baking supplies fresh.  These containers in particular are exactly the right size for 2 pounds of brown sugar. I used to keep mine in the freezer to keep it fresh, but I don't have to do that anymore; I go through supplies fairly quickly, but my dark and light brown sugar are still moist and fresh after two weeks."
"EASY to do with a butter knife inserted between the lid flange and the storage unit's top edge flange - rock it gently and it is open! No leaks, No mess and easy to clean - dishwasher proof - but not microwave proof.. I know they say it is and maybe I just did something wrong but one of my containers now has hair like crack lines on it.. not happy about that but I just do not put them in the microwave immediately after I take them from the freezer.. I like them well enough to live with no microwave use... and I have not asked for a replacement part from manufacture - It still works for lots of things other than food.. and it still holds water with no leaks.. go figure.. I am pleased with my purchase and it is not the only set of these I own.. I have many sizes and shapes all with the same lid issue and even with my hands that are not as able as some - arthritis - but the butter knife works easy so I enjoy them."
"Way too small.. pictures are deceitful... they are tiny, not useful at all.."
"Pros: Great for reheating in the microwave, just flip the tabs up to open the vents and nuke it a couple of minutes and your food is hot with no splatters and no melted plastic. Sizes and shapes are useful, I had doubts that I'd have much use for the smallest size but found it stores more than I expected. They also stack nicely in the fridge or cabinet. Dishwasher safe is also nice, it's plastic so only use the top shelf.  Cons:  Not 100% leak proof , it's plastic and if it's dropped or squeezed it will leak a bit around the edges. Not a big deal for me because under normal use it's spill proof and will even hold liquid without leaking when upside down. as long as it's not squeezed.  Stain proof - NO , it is much more stain resistant than ordinary plastic ware but it will stain.  Odor proof - BIG NO, it picks up odors just like ordinary plastic ware. Have your Baking soda handy for stain and odor removal and soak overnight in a vinegar solution for stubborn odors.  Overall I like the product and find it much more versatile than ordinary plastic containers."
"I have been very pleased with all* of the Rubbermaid Brilliance products that I have purchased. They are well made and do their job beautifully. The gasket seal that goes around the interior of the lid is well made and effectively keeps air out (and the contents in). That being said, I‚Äôll make the following suggestions...  #1 - While I can recommend all of the Brilliance containers I have used without reservations, I suggest trying the 10 piece kit first. The variety of sizes containers in this 10 pack are all useful and will give you a feel for which size containers will be best for you going forward. That was how I was introduced to the Brilliance line and I it worked out well;  #2 - The next suggestion works me but may not be important to you.  Here goes ... Even though Rubbermaid states that the Brilliance containers are dishwasher safe I (still) hand wash them because I don‚Äôt want to take the chance of harming them in the dishwasher. Kinda like your good knives .... why take the chance?  Hand washing with liquid dishwashing detergent (‚ÄúDawn‚Äù in my house) takes no time at all and keeps them looking like ‚Äúday one‚Äù.  #3 - Lastly, they excell l at keeping freezer burn at bay. Frozen fresh blueberries rattle around like glass marbles. Really.  I would not hesitate to recommend the Rubbermaid Brilliance line of products to my friends or my family. All of the containers I have used so far have been well thought out, well made, and have done a great job.  You‚Äôll be surprised when you get a kick out of something like this ...  P.S. * There is one asterisk/ding because one of the lids I received was missing one its two locking latches. A quick phone call to their ‚Äú800‚Äù number had a free replacement in the mail to me. Problem solved."
"I bought these containers in 3 different sizes, each in a pack of 2 containers. They were packaged and shipped with the usual cardboard wrappings, however, each size container had some kind of plastic film on the lid with this ultra sticky gel glue holding it onto the container. This glue is nearly impossible to remove! I have had to put a little bit of Goo Gone on the glue to get it off and the result is a cloudy mark where some of the glue still remains. There is NO NEED to put this sticky glue on there, or the need for a piece of plastic film on the lid! I took 3 stars off the overall rating just for the aggravation and grief this has caused me, and now I have less than perfect containers. Not happy!"
"These are absolutely amazing! They remain crystal clear even after a week in the fridge when chilli in them. I take them to from work and then they go in the dishwasher. They really take abuse well and still look new. These are solid, study and easy to clean and do not harbor bad smells. They even have vent holes so you can microwave in the container without splatter. These are hands down the best storage containers I've ever owned. I definitely recommend. Even people in the office comment on my fancy containers."
I take lunch to work every day since I work in a remote office. These are awesome. Absolutely no leaks even if I drop it. Perfect size for a salad or a full meal. Easy to heat in microwave or just eat cold food. I have 6 of these. Started with 2 and love them for stacking in the fridge with leftovers.
"I started out buying the 2-pack of Medium Deep containers last week and just ordered more sizes. These are the best storage containers I've had and, believe me, I've had a lot since I lived alone (40 + years!) in addition to cooking being a favorite hobby of mine. Now I'm over 65 years old and have had arthritis in both of my hands and fingers that continues to worsen over time. Because of this, it's extremely difficult for me to open and close just about every plastic container that food comes in when I buy it. I usually shop at a couple of local markets but even the ones that you get from a supermarket deli or bakery are problematic. I am so thrilled with these and have NO CONS or COMPLAINTS! ALL PROS: These are really good for storing, microwaving/freezing/refrigerating, keeping everything fresh, they clean quickly and easily, they lock and unlock without any problem or much effort (it takes a lot for me to say this!), I haven't had any issues with odors, spilling (again, having arthritis like I do, it's not something that I can say about similar items), staining, and anything else that might be a concern or cause hesitation in purchasing! An extra benefit is that the lid can be left on and the latch lock can just be lifted up when microwaving so that the steam can be released while heating/cooking. IMO, this beats the need to struggle with Saran Wrap in order to cover the top of something else that doesn't have the same feature. I like the Rubbermaid brand in general, however, some aren't as good as others but this one is a 5* +++ product and comes highly recommended by a ‚Äòfussy and difficult‚Äô consumer! >>> I buy unfamiliar items from Amazon based on the reviews of others, so if this review is helpful for someone else, please mark it as such so that I know for future reviews, thanks!"
"I use these for meal prep & leftovers. I use them in the microwave, dishwasher and freezer. They hold up excellent. They don't have the plastic taste after you heat food in them. They are easily sealed & easy to open. And easy to store. These are everything a container should be."
"Updated June 2021 After using these extensively for a year I'll keep the 5 star rating, but downgrade it a bit to 4.5 It sounds trivial, but over time it's become tedious to need both hands free every time I need to open one of these containers. (Imagine having to find a place to put your bowl of yogurt every time you wanted to add some of the cut up strawberries you've stored in your Rubbermaid container.) In general I still prefer them to my other storage for leftovers because it's so easy to view the contents and the way they can be stacked in the fridge; but they do seem a little less perfect than I originally thought.  Original review December 2020 I bought a few Rubbermaid Brilliance containers to see if I liked them in June 2020 because my SnapLocks needed to be replaced. I've since bought more because they meet my requirements for lightweight but sturdy, clear leak-proof containers that take up minimal space whether they are empty, in the pantry, or in the fridge. I also wanted to be able to microwave leftovers in them. The containers have stayed crystal clear and unclouded through months of hand washings even though we live in a hard water area. Dried on foods clean off easily with a sponge after a brief soaking. I'm not excessively careful with these, but I usually use rubber spatulas and silicon utensils to scrape the contents out when necessary. I‚Äôve been known to eat directly out of the Rubbermaid containers when I‚Äôm feeling lazy. I don‚Äôt use knives to cut food in them, and the surfaces have remained unscratched by metal spoons and forks. Empty containers store compactly because same size containers stack neatly inside of each other. Smaller containers stack neatly on the lids of larger containers. As a bonus the 3.2 cup lid fits several other size containers, including the glass set and canisters. They stack equally well in the fridge. I haven‚Äôt had a leakage problem. The sealing lock works well, and is made so the lid can also be left on while reheating the contents in the microwave by lifting the lock to expose a small vent hole. I don‚Äôt do this often, but the seals seem to remain undamaged by the microwave. Water sometimes remains between the seal and the lid itself. Shaking the lid after cleaning usually removes the water so it can dry more quickly. There haven‚Äôt been any issues with the plastic staining from using in the microwave, even when I tested it with a red sauce. They are not the least expensive storage available, but after six months I feel they will prove durable and cost effective. I also have found some excellent online sales for them, even before Black Friday."
"We bought all the sizes available in multiple numbers and can't say enough about how these have consolidated cupboard and refrigerator space so efficiently. They are heavy duty, absolutely air tight, dishwasher safe, both container and lid, and stack so neatly in cupboards. Dishwashers leave a bit of water that can be eliminated with air drying for a while. We highly recommend all the sizes in this line for just about anything you need to store, dry or cooked. We could not be any happier with our purchases."
"I had several different sizes of these containers but always seemed to need more! I bought my original set at Costco but they, as usual, stopped carrying them. So, I of course, found them on Amazon! We cut up produce for salads1-2 times a week and these containers have such a great seal and seem to ""push out the air"" when you press the lid on so there is very little air in the container. The cut salad fixings stay fresh much longer. Close to a week for everything! We always have ready cut veggies and fruit for salad daily. (We store each veggie in it's own container so we just grab what we want and have a salad in a couple minutes) They also stack well in the fridge."
"There are many lunch options in NYC. Tasty, filling, balanced salad options can range from $12-$16 each. It can get pricey depending on your ingredients. Buying the ingredients yourself can cost about the same as one salad but yield 4-5 servings. I was looking for the perfect size, not too heavy, durable containers that I could use for entree sized salads. And these are it!! I'm so glad they come in this size. I haven't had any leaks yet and I've occasionally mixed in dressing before traveling to work with them. They are easy to clean, though I hand wash everything so I'm not sure how good they are with the dishwasher."
"My biggest gripe is that one of them broke within a few months without any seemingly significant drops or anything like that.  They also aren't totally leak proof, and liquids have leaked out of them on a number of occasions - not a lot of liquid got out, but enough that I was sure to keep them in a plastic bag. There are holes for the locking tabs that don't have a gasket that might be part of the issue. Also, if you've got a stew or soup with a lot of solids in it, they can get between the gasket material and the material, breaking the seal. It's an issue with having the gasket on the inside only rather than making the lid have a silicone or rubber material that goes around the outside where you're less likely to have food debris.  EDIT: I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 star due to the poor durability. The second container broke as I washed it just from the pressure of holding it. I'm not sure if it's the thermal cycling in the microwave or what, but these are just too brittle to last. Very disappointing and only lasted a few months. Nice idea, but poorly executed."
"Love these!! So light and easy to clip shut. I have alot of arthritis in my hands so easy is key. These are easy! Not heavy to carry to work and hold a good sized lunch. As a vegan, I eat alot of veggies and greens. These are perfect. Exactly what I needed. Btw, I previously got a different pyrex brand. They were awful. So hard to close and heavy. Definitely getting rid of them and getting more of these!!!  Update: One lid split after heating food in the microwave. I since learned to break the seal between lid and container before microwaving. I see others had the same issue. Still love these and problem solved!"
Used for food storage in fridge and microwaving. Top rack dishwasher. Used for about 6 months and now looks like hairline cracks have appeared on all the boxes.
"I bought these after watching an America's Test Kitchen video on YouTube. This was the winner in plastic containers and another product won the glass containers category. These are the best plastic food containers I have ever used and I have a few for storing non-food items as they price compare well with home organization containers that you might find at container store but have much better build quality.  Why it this the best plastic food storage conatainer? BPA Free: Check. Works in freezer: Check. Good resistance to dropping: Check. Shake it and it does not leak or have top separation: Check.  I have stored leftover tomato pasta sauce in these. There was barely noticeable discoloration that may disspear with dishwarsher use. With other plastic cotnainers pasta sauce permanently stains them orange and wejust deginate one as the pasta sauce container. While these containers are a little more expensive than the ""red top"" line of Rubbermaid plastic containers found in big box stores, it is completly worth the additional price."
"Holy cow, I love this container set! I mainly use this for storing food and leftovers, but this could conceivably hold nearly anything within the dimensions listed: oil, meat, rubber gloves, several rocks, a bag of plastic horse toys, dirt from your neighbors yard, two spools of grey yarn, all of your shoe laces, a fidget spinner, thousands of ants, a broken horse shoe, a 3 karat diamond engagement ring, a letter to a very old friend, unscented wax, scented wax, fingernails (and the fingers they came from), marbles! I'd imagine these would be great for keeping chips fresh too!  I tell all of my friends about this set. ""Buy! Just do it! Buy this medium sized container set, for Christ's sake. I need this. Can't you see how much I need this? I'm... I'm... I'm drowning over here. I can barely keep my head on straight most of the time. Each day, the same as the last, is an endless slog of unfiltered nothingness. That's worse than depression or despair. It's just nothing. A box with no walls. A sea with no floor. A sky with no horizon."" When I've tired myself out from all the screaming, I put my friends back in the basement and pray to the Night Mother.  Sometimes, if I have been a good boy, I can hear hear whispering through the walls as I am falling asleep. She loves me, and I both love and fear her. She's terrible and beautiful, and all she ever wants for us is to buy affordable rubber-sealed food storage containers. I know she will like this review. She will bring me barley by winter, no doubt, and I will mortar the grain until it is a fine powder that I can coat my face with. If we all buy this Rubbermaid container, no longer shall we be forced to retain the ritual.  We could finally breathe again, place our feet on the earth's cold soil, feel the warmth of the sun, and know all of this chthonic drudgery is over but was so, so worth it."
Very impressed with these containers. They look like glass but they are not. Light weight and durable. I eat pasta often and was worried about stains. After a month of use they are clear. Easy to lock lid. Size is great for one lunch portion.
"Excellent quality, perfect for the fridge. I did a lot of research before buying this item. Hope this review will save you some research. The item is absolutely fantastic. I wanted a see through sealable container to hold bacon and lunchmeat and fruit in the fridge. This fits the bill perfectly. Very well-made, the lid snaps on beautifully, and it‚Äôs relatively easy to pull the lid off. Dimensions are inside 3 inches high and 10 inches long and six and three-quarter inches at the top and it narrows slightly down towards the bottom. He used mine for a pound of bacon and I put my fresh fruits In this container. It‚Äôs seriously keeps everything fresh And it helps keep my refrigerator organized."
"I recently joined a weight-loss program (Noom) so to ensure I stick to my diet, I spend my weekends meal prepping. Enter the Rubbermaid food containers. Not only do they hold an amazing amount of food, but they are: - Airtight - Easy to clean - Safe for the microwave - Safe for the freezer - Red sauce proof - Resusable  I am looking to buy even more of these bad boys and I'm throwing out all of my old ones. They are garbage compared to these things. Here's an example: I use a lot of onions in my meal prepping. So instead of constantly chopping up onions for every recipe, I take 10 minutes to chop up 2-3 onions and put them in a container.  I put half in a Rubbermaid container and sealed it then I put the other half in my old container. I held each container up to my nose and I could smell the onions through the old container but not through the Rubbermaid container. So I transferred it all to the Rubbermaid container and put it in the fridge. I usually don't do this because then my fridge stinks like onion for a week, but not anymore. I can safely store... well, ANYTHING in these bad boys and not have to worry about the smells leaking out.  Yes, they cost a little bit more than your average food container. But they are worth it. So worth it. Do yourself a favor and just click ""Buy"". You'll be happy you did."
I got a set of different sizes first and the 3.2 cup is perfect! So Iordered a set of just the 3.2 cup ones. I cook food and put them in these containers instead of putting pots and pans in the fridge. It saves up so much space and I even started preparing food for 3-4 days at a time and putting them in these containers. I love them!
These are so pretty you could serve out of them! They almost look like glass. The shape is great for stacking in the refrigerator and honestly it just makes more sense. The lids are flat and the closing mechanism works great. They seem to be airtight. I love that I can see clearly what is in the container no guessing. We have decided to hand wash them instead of putting them in the dishwasher simply to try to preserve them. They look so amazing. We're going to more sizes and replace the older stain shield ones. These seem to crack easily and I don't like that. Also the lids are huge on the stain shield containers which ends up taking a lot more space to store them. Time to reboot the storage containers!
"20220407: I've gotten way more of these now than I care to admit. Any down sides? None that I've come across as yet. If I find one, I'll update.  What's so great about these things?  1. They are clear, everywhere, the lid, and the body, you can see what is in the container.  2. These things go in the pantry, the fridge, the microwave, the dishwasher, the freezer. Just about anywhere except the oven.  3. The food does not spill. I've not tried to make them leak on purpose, but I've used them for all sorts of things, including salads, and no leaks (so far).  4. The containers stack. And they stack with different sizes. The system is well thought out, with each change in size being half of the next larger, so two smaller ones will stack on a larger, and so on. There are 4 different basic sizes, with the 3rd largest one coming in two different depths.  I've tossed all my IKEA, older Rubbermaid, and various other storage and replaced with these things. They really are that handy."
I live alone and some meals are just too difficult to make just for one person so I usually have leftovers. I did a Google search to find the best containers to freeze leftovers and these came up so I decided to give them a try based on others reviews as well. I had made fettuccine alfredo with broccoli 2 weeks ago and that's something I normally would not freeze and then reheat but I decided to give it a try. I pulled it out of the freezer today threw it in the microwave to defrost and then reheated in the microwave all in this container and it tasted just as good as the day that I made it.  I also use them for strawberries in the refrigerator and I did notice my strawberries lasted a lot longer than they normally do in a glass Pyrex bowl with a lid.  I highly recommend these and I will be purchasing more.
"I have a collection of these containers in all size but this is by far my favorite and most used size. That being said, I do recommend and assortment as the large ones as they are great for lettuce, breads, and large items. The small and micro ones hold more than you think, and are great for that last serving of sauce or that single serving of a side dish. The medium size is great for storing leftover meals and side dishes. They stack in both your pantry when not in use and in your refrigerator/ freezer, plus their rectangle shape uses the space more efficiently. The transparent material allows you to see what you have and know what is in your fridge/freezer. They also support longer shelf lives as they are airtight. They do not leak and we trust that feature so much that I have been known to pack them on vacation and even to restaurants to store excess food to port home, and I have done this with many kids meals. They are also easy to own, clean up in the dishwasher and are suitable for everywhere from the pantry to the freezer. They re also durable, I have multiple sets and I only have one with slight dishwasher melting on a corner. They are a little pricey, but worth it as you will not want to use anything else."
"I love the rubbermaid brilliance line. I've used them for quite a while now. But this is the first time I bought these smaller 1.3c containers. I had some old Rubbermaid premier in this size that were starting to crack, so it was time to invest in new. I gotta say, these are the cutest containers. It's like when a little baby wears a cute pair of shoes. The entire family was eyeing them when I put them on the counter. Of course I said, no way, take the old one's in your lunch bags. But I'm back to buy some more. Because if these cute little things make them smile at lunch, they can have some :-)."
"I love these containers. I use the medium ones in the refrigerator ‚Äî they stack easily to save space, and I can see clearly what‚Äôs inside. The sides and top are clear as glass, so the contents are perfectly visible.  So far, I have used these medium containers only for fridge storage ‚Äî I don‚Äôt warm food in them in the microwave. I probably could, but I love them so much I want to keep them beautiful. (I sometimes make mistakes with the length of time and ruin containers.) I do wash them in the dishwasher, no problem. I also have washed them by hand, and they‚Äôre easy to clean.  I also bought a large-size container to hold flour. It‚Äôs sturdier and far more airtight than the cheap plastic containers I‚Äôve been using, as those flimsier lids aren‚Äôt as snug and start to crack after a year. The sturdy Rubbermaid Brilliance container protects the flour perfectly from moisture and bugs. I plan to replace ALL the cheap plastic containers over the next several months. It‚Äôs a good investment.  It is rare that a product makes me so happy. But every time I use these containers, I smile with satisfaction."
"Really love these - perfect for my small refrigerator and freezer, especially with the rectangular design. They don't completely seal, though - ice crystals get in; I like to make batches of food and keep them for work lunches. By the end of the week, the frozen ones are covered with ice. I will keep them, because they ARE fairly snug and allow me to use space wisely."
"I absolutely love these things. This is my third order. I originally ordered one set to see how I would like them for meal prepping. I put my fruits and veggies in these. YALL. My salads can be prepped in here (without dressing) and stay BEAUTIFUL for a week. GAME CHANGER!!!! Like all of us, I am busy and do not have time to be constantly prepping throughout my week. I do not like wilted produce. I want things to stay crisp with that nice crunch. And these do the trick! They are sturdy without being too heavy, stack nicely, and are the perfect size for a salad at lunch time! Phasing out all my other containers to fill up in these. Absolutely in love. Meal Preppers, indulge!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I have been buying the regular storage containers at the Dollar Store as well as the Ziploc and Rubbermaid storage containers from the grocery store and Walmart. I always hated that in the process of reheating foods from the freezer eventually the plastic would breach from the heat, or discolor so badly from tomato based foods that I had to throw them away. When I read that the ""Brilliance"" Rubbermaid containers were made from TRITON plastic, that got my attention. I had purchased wine glasses made from Triton plastic for use around the pool and loved that they were dishwasher safe too. So I invested in several sizes to try these out. I have used them for a month now and have only positive things to say. I like that the containers do not hold smells from the food that was in it and they also do not stain from tomato based sauces and soups. I was also amazed by the strong gasket that seals the top on to the container and the fact that you leave the lid on while reheating in the microwave (no food splattering) is a bonus. You can do that because the clips on the sides are unlatched before you put the container inside the microwave and that exposes some air holes, while the seal is really tight. The only downside for me is that I wish they made more sizes. The 3 and 4.7 c containers are great for leftovers, but meals I cook ahead of time to store in the freezer either take an 8 or 11 c. container. So the size jumps from the 4 1/2 c to the 9 1/2 c size. Rubbermaid needs to make a 8 c. size and an 11 c size."
"I've used a variety of containers like this throughout my lifetime. My mother sold Tupperware back in the 70's, and for many years that was the go-to standard, but as plastic has evolved over the decades, many different types of storage containers have crossed my kitchen counters. These beat them all so far.  I noticed in the comments on the Amazon Brain version of these some people had issues with microwaving food in them, because theirs say ""remove lids before microwaving"" but these specifically are designed to be microwaved with the lids on as long as the latches are up, because the steam vent is under the latch. So far, this has resolved any warping problem with microwaving and there has been no melted seals, warped lids or bubbled containers - and with a LIFETIME warranty, I'm sure if you did get one of those issues, Rubbermaid is a well known and respected brand with good customer service (at least they used to, I don't know now, I haven't needed to call them.)  These hold up very well with the grandkids and the clumsy husband, very water-tight! If you put something like a freshly peeled and sliced cucumber in it and seal it, you'll see slight ""steam""-looking condensation in a matter of a couple of minutes! Yet my fresh veggies stay much more crisp in these than just in the crisper drawer in general by far! I pre-make salads for the week, and these hold up very well all week long. They also have not scratched from eating directly out of them, fork tines and all, although I've never used a knife in one of them (never had a reason to,) but I feel like they'd hold up to that once in a while. I also feel like these would hold up VERY well to hold items like onions and butter in the refrigerator to keep smells from cross-contamination!! As soon as I order more of these I intend to test that - I also prep Mire Poix for omelets and other dishes, and I intend to have a container of various toppings for salads or other dishes as well.  Definitely worth the buy, especially with the lifetime warranty!!"
"I have use these products for years I love them they had to of been invented by a woman that knows how to cook there‚Äôs only a few lids that fits on all the sizes. It‚Äôs a great system to have the pantry containers that are taller and larger then they have the storage containers that I also use in my pantry that are stackable and shorter. My two girls have been using these for years that‚Äôs the reason why I decided to go with them in my pantry I was so impressed with the quality and how they have lasted they put them through the dishwasher I tend to hand wash when is the Flight Attendant one is a nurse they had to take the meals with them every time they go to work so leakproof is a really big deal being able to heat it up in the container is another really big deal and haven‚Äôt discolored or warm while being heated up & not the weight of glass that would possibly shatter is another really big deal deal. They do make a Pyrex bottom that has the same lids at snap on that are still leak proof I would get those but I have a stack of other containers that I do love there are also Rectangular that I have had for 25 years, If we ever get back to our second home in Canada I will probably pack my Pyrex dishes up from here take them there and order the Pyrex version of the brilliance for this house I absolutely love these things the best of all I can tell you is coffee in the great big container when you go to make your grocery list you can see what you have it‚Äôs not an a box or bag or container you can‚Äôt see through . you can just look and tell what you need to go buy more of. I did my entire pantry it was expensive I‚Äôm not going to lie I absolutely love it I hate this pantry this is made it better so much better. They stack well .& the lids aren‚Äôt bulky. I like these so much better than the other ox# brand."
"These are perfection! I can fit a pound of deli meat or cheese or a bottle of sliced pickles in these 3.2 size. I used the 1.2 for cherries, hummus, olives, and spreads. No more hunting for expired food that I can't find. My whole sandwich buffet is at my fingertips. And it looks pretty too! I've also been happy with their Freshworks bins also. In my pantry, the 1.3 size holds beef jerkey, candy, soy sauce packets, and so much more. I'm buying more for tradeouts so they can go in the dishwasher when I get new meat etc and not miss a beat. They come out of the dishwasher sparkling clean. I'm so satisfied. Rubbermaid, you hit a home run with these!"
"Waited at least a month before commenting on these containers. I have tried sooo many types of containers for my husband's lunch over the years and dare I say these seem to be perfect all around. He brings 2 each day in his lunch pail and is thrilled with them. He doesn't have to remove the lids to microwave and they don't leak. Did I mention they DON'T leak! He showed me the other day why he thought they were so great. He stands them sideways (stacked on edge) next to his Gatorade in his lunch pail and they don't leak, no matter what he has in them. I couldn't believe it. Here I was thinking they were great because they don't melt in the microwave and nothing stains them, not even spaghetti. So portion size is good, clean great, don't leak and are durable (did I mention my husband is super rough on things). Yippee I found a winner!"
"I originally purchased a set of these from Costco- I liked them so much that I ditched all other containers brands that I had to replace with these. When I went to buy a second set they were no longer available... thank goodness I found them here on Amazon. These are superior to other brands because 1- they‚Äôre a hard/acrylic type plastic (bpa free) 2- they‚Äôre leak proof, I haven‚Äôt had anything leak (but I wouldn‚Äôt fill one with red wine and then toss around a room with white carpet ü•¥) 3- they‚Äôre airtight! Food stay fresher, longer 4- they work very well in the freezer, I can buy a large/bulk pack of steaks and freeze them in one of these containers (each steak wrapped in parchment paper) and it‚Äôs pretty amazing how pink and fresh they are compared to a freezer bag or other storage containers, no ice or freezer burn 5- they wash well in the dishwasher, no distortion of shape and I haven‚Äôt found a tomato sauce yet that has stained one 6- they stack and store easily. The only top I have is that you be really careful the fist few times when opening and closing them because the latches on the side seal TIGHT and I‚Äôve caught my finger in them twice now (you‚Äôll see exactly what I mean when you get them) so be conscious about it and after a few times it will be second nature. When you place the lid on the container, press down to release air from container and with lid pressed down, snap the latches closed. I‚Äôve liked these so much that I replaced all of my older stuff (including expensive glass containers) with these."
"Like most people you acquire many different types of storage containers, you may like or dislike certain features of each container.  But then comes Brilliance by Rubbermaid and it changes the storage container conundrum. I cannot think of one thing that Rubbermaid hasn‚Äôt thought of. The containers are easy to use with a closure that is easy to use and is airtight. You can freeze anything you make in them and reheat in them in a microwave. The only thing you cannot do with Brilliance is put them in the oven! Clean up Brilliance on the top rack of your dishwasher and they are stain resistant. Have used them to store Stuffed Cabbage, dropped them in the freezer and after reheating in the microwave Brilliance was totally stain free. My plastic containers are all stained from tomato based foods but Brilliance did not stain.  I have now purchased additional Brilliance containers in a multitude of sizes to replace my ugly stained and wrecked containers. I am extremely pleased with the Brilliance product and they are made in the USA. Rubbermaid has knocked this one out of the park with Brilliance product line and Rubbermaid is making a difference as Brilliance is made in the USA and employs our fellow citizens."
"I bought these and some other plastic type of containers. I love that these are totally see through. The other containers have a colored lid and the bottom is opaque so you can not really tell 100% what is inside. I often send things for lunch that have a bit of liquid to them, these lids are so secure I never worry they will leak. I can not say that about any other containers.  We dont use these in the microwave, but I know you can use them in the freezer, microwave and dishwasher with no problem. I had some other Rubbermaid containers made out of what looked like the same material. After a couple years of going in the freezer and then to the microwave after a while those tended to get scratched and brittle. I was given a large set of these as a gift and did not want to ruin them by putting them in the freezer and then straight to the microwave without thawing first. So we just use these in the refrigerator and lunch boxes.  They are such a great size. After ordering 2 of them and loving them so much I went back and ordered 6 more. I use them to send 2 muffins to work with my husband, or some type of cole slaw or other salads with a dressing that I never worry will leak. They are a great size for a couple of boiled eggs, a piece of cornbread, portion of cut up fruit, or a piece of cake or cobbler. We needed quite a few containers to start out, and rather than buy 15-20 of these I bought 8 total and some cheaper plastic that will be upgraded to this type of container at some point in the future.  Unlike cheap plastice containers which I do not like to put in the dishwasher unless there is something glass to hold them down otherwise they flip upside down and fill up with water. However, I put these in and know they are heavy enough to stay put."
"I now have several different containers from the Brilliance line. Most of them are to hold my baking supplies (sugars, sprinkles, various other powders) I dropped one full of powdered sugar on my tile kitchen floor and the container didn't break (could have been the angle--YMMV) but more than that, not one tiny bit of powdered sugar escaped the seal. As powdered sugar is the most evil of all the sugars in its ability to get absolutely EVERYWHERE, this was a big deal for me. I have the Bento set as well, though I am not using it for food. (Quarantine) I have them organising pieces of projects I'm working on. You really can't go wrong with anything in this line."
"I love these. They go into the freezer and nothing gets in. Yes, as someone mentioned, there are ""ice crystals"" in the container, but they didn't GET in the container from the outside, they formed from the moisture in the food INSIDE the container. (This is covered in second grade science class; I taught it.) I have carried soup to work... zero leakage! I put them in the microwave (with the cover NOT LATCHED, as recommended) and I I have been doing this for a couple of years, no ""hairline cracks,"" nothing. (I follow directions.) I microwave for a minute or two, not five or ten, either... not needed. They wash perfectly in the dishwasher. There is nothing better on the market than these. I am 71 and I have arthritic fingers... zero issues getting them open. The sizes are perfect and they stack nicely. Absolutely wonderful!!"
"This is the perfect size for our family. It also fits just right into my husbands lunch box, so he gets a hot lunch each day and the contents don't spill or leak. Love that these are air-tight, which also keeps our leftovers fresh longer. Comes out perfect from dishwasher. Gradually replacing all my cheap plasticware with these, totally worth the money!"
"Refreshed all my leftover storage containers with these and don‚Äôt regret it. The big pro for me was the fact you can leave the lid on the container and lift the latches and put it in the microwave as there are vents that expose when the latches are up. Only con is for some weird reason, my dish washer dries most of my plates and bowls just fine but these are always quite wet at the end of the cycle and i have to place them on a drying rack. Only other can is the biggest lids take a bit of work to remove so be careful if you fill them with mini m&ms as they might be all over your floor prying the lid off. still the best out there I‚Äôve ran into and I really like i can reorder what i want if i run short on one size or another."
"I love these containers so much! I first started using them about a year ago for leftovers in my fridge, and they are so amazing. They never ever ever hold any kinds of odors or stains, and theyre very easy to wash. They never leak, I‚Äôve never had one crack, and they look so beautiful, just as glassy and pretty as the first day that I got them! I recently made over my pantry, and I wanted to find the best containers to store my dry goods but that also look beautiful. I dont know why I didnt think to use these ones earlier! I am so glad that I went with them for the pantry also, because they are amazing for pantry storage as well! They are airtight, Beautiful, modular and stackable, and just so easy to take care of and so practical. I think I have eight or nine sets of these between all of the pantry and fridge items I use them for, and I love how every single food storage container in my house is all the same exact style, so the store very easily in the pantry when not in use. I am so in love! They are such amazing quality, I highly recommend these!"
"I have a ton of containers, from generic dollar store containers to Pyrex to those cutesy little ceramic ones you find at TJ Maxx, to the Oxo pop top dry storage containers. These are very impressive. They are 100% spill proof in my experience, the only containers I'll put in my work bag sideways with liquid in them. Their greatest virtue imo is that they don't get hot in the microwave while the contents do--they are truly meaningfully microwave safe.  My only complaint is that the lids don't nest as well as other containers, but it's worth it. I hope to eventually replace most of my containers with these as I need to buy new ones."
"As I have become more advanced in my senior years, an issue with dropping things has become a real problem. As a result, we decided to remove our glass storage containers and replace them with a good plastic, dishwasher safe, sealing product. We did our research on line, purchased couple different brands, and decided to go with the Rubbermaid Brilliance. They stack so well eliminating having to remove containers to get to the one needed and the largest one is used to hold the lids for easy access. Product is terrific!"
"America's Test Kitchen highly recommended this product and I have been looking for something for Korean Food. that can stink your entire refrigerator if it isn't airtight and can stain any tupperware too. I even purchased several containers from Korean Stores just for Kimchi and other side dishes thinking it was meant for Korean food. I also have a different refrigerator just for all the Korean side dishes. But even then, you can still smell it every time you open the fridge. So I decided to purchase Rubbermaid and give the Korean kimchi test. It works, no smell, it's airtight, no leakage and best of all, it cleans really well and it doesn't stain nor smell. Perfect. So now I have replaced all my Snapware to Rubbermaid Brilliance for my Korean food as well as other leftover foods. Best money spent. If you east lots of ethnic food, use Rubbermaid Brilliance for your storage - also works on Indian Food."
"I have a cooking blog and do a lot of meal prepping, so I've owned *many* food storage containers. I tried replacing all of my plastic containers in exchange for glass (more eco-friendly), but there were some things I missed about plastic containers. With plastic, the seals are generally tighter, meaning your food stays fresher longer. I also like that I don't have to be so careful cleaning and storing them (I've broken a few glass containers), and they stack nicely on top of one another, saving cabinet space. I saw the Rubbermaid Brilliance line at Target and purchased a few sizes, and I've since purchased more because I love them so much. These containers are 7 1/2"" x 11"", and they're perfect for storing baked goods (I can fit 8 standard-sized muffins in there). They're easy to clean and stack nicely. My only complaint is I wish the lids were easier to stack and store. I use a pot lid sorter and they take up quite a bit of room."
"Owning these, I now cannot imagine life before. These plastic storage containers are robust and well constructed. They hold up to abuse and can even be shaken vigorously with soup in them without risking a leak. For convenience, they are completely microwave and dishwasher safe and have held up to 50+ cycles by this point. The seal is significant in that it acts as a vapor barrier (you don't smell what's inside until you open it). Huge plus. Additionally, you can unlatch the handles while keeping the lid sealed on, exposing vent holes. This allows you to microwave the contents without having to cover the top or worry about splashing -- ingenious design! They're also gorgeous looking (and this aesthetic holds up, they don't stain) to boot and stack well.  Really can't say enough good things. I threw out my yellowed, flimsy, ineffective plastic containers and replaced them all with these Rubbermaid Brilliance containers and will never look back!"
"I gave all 5 stars and if anything changes I will edit down but so far with several uses these have been amazing. I have not used them with spaghetti sauce so I am not sure if THAT would stain them. I have used several soups, chicken, teriyaki rice, mashed potatoes, and they have been washed in a dishwasher and microwave a few times now. Every time they come out of the dishwasher clean, the rubber is in perfect condition, and the vents work perfectly. After several different types of containers looking for meal prep stuff I decided to buy a few more sets. The only thing I can think of where I would use one of the other containers is if I need a container with 2 divided slots and I have plenty of those. I have probably 50 containers and I kept getting frustrated when I ran out of these because I quickly preferred these over any other."
"The seal on these is fantastic, it works so well that occasionally it takes a bit of effort to get the lid off, which is a GOOD thing! I have several of the 3.2 cup containers and other sizes as well. I use them in my freezer, fridge and microwave. I wash them on the top rack of my dishwasher and they come out crystal clear. I have been using the Rubbermaid Brilliance containers for months now and they still look great, no stains. I like that the lid can stay sealed in the microwave after opening the vents, no more microwave splatters. I have seen reviews that say these do not stack. I stack mine and if you flip every other lid over, the lids stack nicely too. Oh, and they sure are pretty...and it's nice being able to clearly see what is in the containers. Of course they are expensive so shop around....I caught these 3.2 cup containers and the brown sugar/12 cup baking pair set at a great price here on Amazon and my big set on sale at another store."
Superior storage container  We have had a set for a long time decided to get a set for my mother-in-law she loves them they don‚Äôt discolor with tomato-based products easily clean and maintain an airtight seal we‚Äôve had ours probably a year and a half and they‚Äôre just wonderful A must have
"I bought a couple of these for a very specific purpose of storing some stronger smelling products I sell at an outdoor farmer's market. I needed them to seal tightly so the smell didn't get into other items and mix flavors/smells. I also needed them to be a certain dimension, big enough to hold my products, small enough to fit multiples in another tote. And most importantly, I needed them to be able to take a beating since I frequently drop things on concrete when I'm at the market. These fit all my needs perfectly. I've dropped them on concrete already and they didn't break. The lids fit tightly and then latch closed so no smells at all get out. This particular size is perfect for my needs. The clearness of them is just an added bonus. These are as clear as glass so you can easily see what is inside. My only problem is that now I want to replace all of my old plastic containers with these Brilliance ones."
"I bought these so I can see what‚Äôs inside containers very easily when they‚Äôre stacked in the refrigerator. The bonus is that they stack very well on top of each other, and the other sizes stacked on each other also! (For example, two of these fIt exactly on top of the next largest size.). When you put the lid on and close the flaps, it‚Äôs leakproof, making it perfect for taking to work. Then, at lunch, you flip the black flaps up, and there are two vent holes underneath so you can just put the whole thing in the microwave without taking the lid off! So, you won‚Äôt have a messy microwave using these. Oh, and did you notice they are PLASTIC!?! SOO NICE not having to worry about children dropping them (including the adult children)! Ha ha! Con: they go in the dishwasher, but it says to hand wash the rubber gaskets. I have to admit, we just put the whole thing in the dishwasher, and we haven‚Äôt had problems. I imagine the gaskets would last longer if they are hand washed."
"I love these containers. This was my second order because I loved the first set that I purchased and just needed more. I have re-done and organized my pantry and found these to be the best product on the market for that. The only thing I do not like about them is that they do not stack well within each other when they are not in use. Rubbermaid does have another product four-story food in the refrigerator that do stack inside each other very well. The good thing about this is that, for me, I have every single container in use, so the stacking issue is not a problem. When they arrive in the box there is a sheet in between all of the bottom portion of the containers, to prevent them from getting stuck together. If you store them, you will need to do the same thing if they will be stacked on each other. They are very difficult to get a part. But other than that issue, These containers are great!"
I love these. These are probably one of the best investments I've made for my kitchen. They are quite expensive compared to other food storage methods. But the it is so easy to clean the seal. And I absolutely love how it does not stain like the previous bowl set that I had. I also really love that it does not absorb odors as easily as the previous set that I had. This item does not have an issue with melting/bubbling around the top of the food like my previous set. Also it's nice that I can just flip one of the levers up and it vents in the microwave. Very well designed and I'm very happy with this purchase.
Convenient size holds enough homemade soup for 2. Does not stain after several uses of leftover homemade soup and spaghetti. Easy to wash by hand - have not put them in top rack of dw even though it is allowed. Bottoms stack nicely for storage and they stack nicely in the refrigerator. Can 'see' the contents so no more guessing. Easy to 'use' for senior folks. Absolutely fabulous storage container AND the shocking feature to me was the 3.2 size cover is the same size as the 4.7 cover so interchangeable. Literally went through my cabinets and threw out 50 years of old containers. Fabulous design and product for everyone.
"Silicone seals with locking handles; easy to press closed and click handles. Could be good for people with limited strength and/or arthritis. Breaking the seal can be done with a butter knife for some leverage, without damaging the lip of the lid/tray, but they are easy to open as-is. Microwave safe, dishwasher safe, crystal clear plastic. Would recommend not using in the freezer if full of food that could expand in the freezer; cheaper containers should be used in the freezer. These are best for storing in cupboards or fridge, and for pack-lunches/transportation."
"I use these in my pantry & my freezer (they really help corral items in my pull-out drawer). I don‚Äôt use them for food storage (I.e leftovers or prepped food), so I can‚Äôt answer to that. I‚Äôve also never microwaved in them. They‚Äôre durable (dropped more than once!), clear (dishwashing for these with no cloudiness or pitting), and air tight (no odors have been picked up, even with flour storage in freezer). My only complaint is that they‚Äôre more expensive than the old snap-and-seal rubbermaids I used to use. I‚Äôll definitely purchase again (and again)."
"I like plastic food storage containers but they always seem to stain, especially if you're storing anything with a spaghetti sauce. Many companies claim to be stain-resistant but I've never had much luck with them. These, however, seem to be working just fine. I've had these for about two months now and haven't had any problems with them getting stained.  They have a solid seal on them and lock into place. For some of the containers with locks on all four sides, I've found that I can only get two sides to lock. I wish they came in a slightly larger size."
"Ignore all of the negative reviews on the sizes - apparently people don't know how to read or understand measurements. They again, seeing reviews people leave for other products...  Anyway, these are solid, lightweight, crystal clear and great for organizing your fridge. I even use them for takeaway for some local restaurant to cut down on styrofoam use."
These are really cool but they have huge design flaws!!  Pros: Sleek look Easily stackable when in use Air tight seal as advertised Dishwasher top rack safe! Always a plus!!  Cons: Weak design flaws Short/small lid lip for gripping to open air tight containers Bubbles in plastic making creating weak points Breaking due to above mentioned....  I‚Äôm really bummed about it. It still seals but now it has sharp plastic edges from where it broke. Just hope I can fix it.
"NO ONE WOULD EVER THINK I would be the kind of guy who would review a food storage container. Certainly not me! Yet here I am. It does not pit or warp out of shape when heating things in the microwave. Nothing stains it, not spaghetti sauce, beet juice, or grape juice. It doesn't leach plastic chemicals into your food. It seals tightly, doesn't leak, and keeps food fresh longer. Use it in the 'fridge or freezer. It's easy to clean by hand, or just wash it in the dishwasher. The shape saves space in my cabinets and the fridge, and they stack to save even more room while storing more food. The price nearly deterred my purchase, but I am glad it didn't. One downside: NEVER use these to deliver food to someone. You may not get the container back."
"Rubbermaid got it right! I love these containers! I can see what is inside. Ideally sized for individual portions. Air tight, push the lid closed and then snap the two air vents down! It won‚Äôt leak the large rubber seal really works! EASY TO OPEN unsnap the vent covers, open the lid with two fingers! Dishwasher and microwave safe! Take your portion sized container out of the fridge remove top and microwave your meal! Eat out of the container or place the container on the table to share with others. You can reseal and put it back in the fridge or stick it in the dishwasher. A single person doesn‚Äôt even need a plate, life just keeps getting better!"
"I love this line of storage containers and am converting over to them for my entire pantry stock. I have seen no evidence of leaks. They clean up easily by hand and can be put in the dish washer. They have a nice clean sleek style and no ornate grooves where flour, corn starch, or sugar gets caked into & needs cleaned out. They hold up well in the freezer also. I like that they are perfectly clear so you can easily identify what is in them. I have seen no discoloration. They can be stacked on top of each other if you have shelf height. I recommend them."
Love this tight seal containers. I use my 2 for my deli meats and the other one for my slice cheeses.. perfect for easy access. Much betterthe cheap Rubbermaid containers.. no air.. meats last longer and cheese stays fresher.. wish the were a little longer and a little deeper. Because I have 5 members in my family. Between school and work lunches.. daily what I saved one One Sandwich. It paid for itself .. and waiting in line. For a sandwich thrown together with no love.. Thank you for your clever containers.. Love my Set.!! My fridge Deli Drawer..fridge by Samsung..
"I love these food storage containers. I make a lot of soup and freeze it for lunches and quick dinners. The vented top makes it ideal for heating in the microwave. No more trying to figure out which lid goes with which container, which was a big problem with my old food storage containers. The sizes are different enough in these that you can see at a glance which lid goes with which container. I love that they are clear so even in the freezer you can figure out what is in them if you don't mark them. Spaghetti sauce does not stain them orange! They are easy to clean in the dishwasher and don't warp. I literally threw out every single other food container that I owned and stocked up on these."
"Best bargain ever!! I bet you can't find a GLASS 24 piece Tupperware set under $30 just like that, or maybe you can but I know I couldn't... idk how many different Targets I went to, and given this virus pandemic, Ross, TJ Max and Marshall's where I'm sure I could've found them, are closed :( but thank you Amazon for saving me hellla money. They arrived within a week, very well packaged to prevent breaks and scratches. I put them in a sink full of water and antibacterial soap and rinsed and air dried them without a problem (:  I love the little tiny containers (those are plastic btw)  Edit: almost 2 months of having them and I'm still in love with them! They keep food extremely fresh as its air tight. I kept cereal in my mini fridge at work for like 4 days and when I finally decided to eat it, I thought it'd of been stale or had a different taste to it and nope, fresh as ever. Dont microwave with the lid tightly shut, do leave an opening for the evaporation to escape and if your lid seems to have curved cus of the heat, just rinse it under cool water and it'll go back to flat."
"Okay, so these are so just so cute! I love the little square ones. They hold my snackin' cheese quite nicely. These are perfect for one to two people's weekly meal prep, or for small accessible storage. They aren't particularly good if you're looking to purchase a one-and-done set for full blown meal-prepping for a large family. Nor if you typically eat American restaurant size portions for meals. They do lean more towards the Asian / European portioning sizes. I also wouldn't recommend these for people with any hand issues or disabilities. The lids require a little extra oomph to get them off.  The packaging was great. No dents or any dirt. The product itself is nice and light, but has enough weight for it to feel sturdy. The lids are also a thick plastic, and have a good seal on them. They fit great in my tiny refrigerator. I'm happy that I purchased them and would definitely recommend them."
"These glass dishes arrived in perfect condition! The manufacturer had them well packed to protect & they were placed in an Amazon package with bubble wrap! They appear well made. I can't comment on ""leak proof"" since we only received yesterday, but as I previously stated they appear well made. There are 4 small containers with lids, they are plastic which is fine. Since we often take lunches these seem the perfect condiment containers (we don't like to put condiments on until ready to eat - bread/buns get soggy).  August 2,2020 update: Wanted to add the update about the lids. They are fantastic - fit tightly & keep every thing fresh!!! We don't put any plastic lids in the dishwasher - this is just our preference & has nothing to do with the manufacturer of these lids. Highly recommend these containers - we will be buying more!"
"poor quality... I have about 12 days using them and one of them broke where the lid is secured and my husband didn‚Äôt realize it until he was chewing that little piece with his food... another one of them has a line as if it will soon break, I have not even used them in the oven, dishwasher or freezer and I have been very careful when washing and storing them :("
After about three months I noticed chips flaking off the sides of three of the containers. Just now I found out what's happening. The heat cycles from washing in a dishwasher are causing chips to flake off turning them into obsidian circles of vengeance. I'm typing this review one handed cause I sliced open the pinky on my right hand taking one of these things out of the washer.  Heed my warning and save yourselves. Buy some other glassware. These things are a festering pile of crap (assuming crap comes in the shape of a bowl.)  Seriously. Don't buy this set. It's a safety hazard. Definitely not for households with children.
"I purchased these on January 22, hoping to use them to replace some of our plastic containers.  Pros: The containers really do keep liquids in and are easy to clean.  Cons: The rubber seals on the lids come off easily, making securing the lids to the container itself more trouble than necessary.  This evening, however, was supremely disappointed when one of the rubber seals stuck to the glass container. As I was trying to peel it off, the thing tore into several pieces. Moreover, there are pieces of seal stuck to the glass container itself.  Amazon says the company has a support website. As of this evening, that is inoperable. Oh, and today wound up being the last day to return the product.  Like I said, great idea, poor execution. I would not buy this."
FIRST IMPRESSION OUT OF THE BOX: I love it. Just as pictured. Good quality. I bought these for my new house so I wont be using them until I move. so I checked each individual piece for cracks/break/ scratches. None seen. I would definitely recommend on those terms. I will update if anything changes after use.
"When I received the containers the lid on the large round bowl was cracked. I sent a photo to Mcirco on 8/5/20 with a request for a replacement lid but have gotten no response in 10 days. The product description states: 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: If you receive cracked products or you are not 100% satisfied with our products, please feel free to contact our customer service. We will provide the best solution for you within 24 hours. The containers are just the size I need and would love to keep them. But without lids they are of no use to me. I phoned Amazon Customer Service and was told they could not contact them. I have until 8/29/20 to return them. They are heavy glass containers and it seems far more economical to just send me a light weight lid. Anyone else have problems with the lids?"
"I spent hours looking through all the options here and settled on this set -- and we are all so pleased with them! They were carefully packaged, are easy to clean, can be used anywhere, and don't leak toxins into our food. All wins!"
"These storage containers are great! I ordered a set when they went on sale recently and have been using them for a couple months. They arrived well-packaged so there were no broken or cracked containers. So far, they are very durable. I find the lids are easy to fit and remove. The set includes a nice range of usable sizes with a couple of them duplicated in the mix. The containers are a great replacement for the plastic ""take-out"" containers I used to save and resuse. Those never quite seemed to come completely clean, didn't work well in the freezer, and the lids often cracked over time. The one minor caveat is that the lids to these containers appear to be made from plastic (as opposed to the glass containers), thus I remove them before reheating leftovers in the microwave or oven. I also wash them separately by hand even though I can put the containers in the dishwasher. I liked these so much I have ordered sets for other family members. They make a lot of sense as many of us are storing more foods as we stay at home."
"Very impressed by the quality, construction and function of the locking lids! So far I'm completely satisfied with this set. The sizes are appropriate. The hinged lid latches are sturdy and the gasket seals tight! We've discarded our previous ""good"" containers that didn't have hinged latches which eventually broke off. These containers and especially the lids make every other fridge container look like junk! These are very functional. My wife and kids all exclaimed ""woah!"" when we opened the box! My wife has mentioned several times that these are really nice. We are very satisfied."
I bought this set because I purged my cupboards of all the unsafe plastic food containers and need to replace with glass ones. These are a great value for the price and there is a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Perfect for my needs here! I‚Äôll never go back to plastic again! Lids lock securely and they stack nicely too! I definitely recommend this set!
"Item came quickly and in excellent shape. Packing was very good. Have used these and they are holding up well in the freezer and the oven. I do wash the lids by hand. Not certain if I have to or not, just trying to be extra careful. Containers are stackable and don't take a lot of space in cabinet. So far am very happy with this purchase. I love the variety of sizes provided in this set."
"I love these, I first bought them in 2020 and they are still like new. I use them for leftovers, and fridge storage containers. They are in constant use, hardly ever make it back to the shelf after being washed. Things like cut fruit, or soft cheeses stay fresh for much longer than with regular tuppers. I have dropped them too, none have broken yet, so they are clumsy resistant."
"After reading a lot of reviews and descriptions of glass containers I decided to go with these. The sizes are perfect and surprisingly the containers themselves are lite weight. The lids are not microwave safe but that's what I'm trying to get away from. Just know that when cleaning the lids you should remove the rubber ring so that you can dry the lid all over. Fortunately, these are easy to remove and replace. Overall I highly recommend these!!"
"The product arrives nice and secured in their own slots covered with protective wrap. I was impressed with the thickness of the glass. Also I was happily surprised the see the set comes with 4 sauce containers (super cute). Easy to wash and store, I‚Äôm happy with this purchase as I‚Äôve always wanted sturdy glass containers for my kitchen. If you‚Äôre looking for some I definitely recommend this set!"
I was trying to move away from plastic containers and their missing lids. Lol. I was pleasantly surprised that these glass containers were exactly what I needed. Although they look small they can hold more than what it looks like. I also like the four little plastic containers for when I prep for recipes. Easy to clean and they don‚Äôt leak. Perfect. I will buying another set soon for my grains and beans. My cabinets will be so organized.
"The lids on the smallest container (the ones you'd use for salad dressing) are not dishwasher safe - my lids melted in the dishwasher. Other than that, they worked great for everything that I needed. I ran them through the dishwasher to see how they would hold up before using them and most of them held up well. I have also used them oven to table and they worked perfectly. I did have to order more of the larger size containers as for what I cook is mostly casseroles for one per dish. The 36oz 5 pack was a great addition to this order. The variety this order offered was great for leftovers of a smaller nature or snacks like grapes, almonds, etc. If you are going to meal prep, I highly recommend adding the 36oz 5 pack in addition to this order."
As a single person home this set size is perfect for my typical leftovers or replacement packaging for plastic wrapped perishables. I have stored liquids and solids no problem. With the air tightness of this product I feel my food waste has reduced due to products lasting longer. Very happy with my purchase.
"I'll give this one star, because two lids arrived broken. this was not because of poorly packaged; no this was packed broken. Of course, they are the biggest round and the biggest square ones. Probably the ones that would have received the most use. So, until I get replacement lids, the one star stands. I went to product support as instructed on to find the page is no longer there. Update, I'll now give these a five, as the company was quick to send the replacement lids. I've been using these in the meantime and will order again!!!!"
great for the price compared to others no leaks very durable clips to close come off and on easily which is great because that ensure it will always close each time (issue with other storage is built in clip would never close all the way) great assortment of sizes  GET IT
"I first saw these while visiting my brother who has been using these glass storage containers for a couple of years. I liked the fact that they are glass, no harmful chemicals, no staining and easy to store."
I read through a lot of reviews and decided to order them. None of them were chipped or broken. I immediately did a seal test and they held water with no spills. I don't like my food touching so for me they are going to be perfect for packing my lunches. I plan on ordering more.
I like how the lids fit and lock on easily. I had a few different containers that drove me crazy trying to seal the lids they had to be placed perfectly or they wouldn‚Äôt shut. These new containers align easily and lockup tight first try every time.
WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM MICROWAVE PLASTIC CONTAINERS AND PURCHASED THESES GLASS MEAL PREP CONTAINERS. THE BEST PART ABOUT THEM IS THE LIDS. THEY ARE SO EASH TO SNAP ON AND OFF WE REALLY LIKE THEM. ALSO EASY TO WASH WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE BECAUSE OF HOW EASY THE LIDS SNAP ON AND OFF.
Love these containers! Will never go back to plastic. They are so easy to clean and it‚Äôs so nice to be able to pop off the lid and use the container in the microwave or oven.
"Packaged well when shipped, lids look sturdy and clips are easy to latch while still providing leak proof protection. I like that the seals are removable so food does not get trapped so mold and mildew do not grow between the seal and the lids. Glass is thick so i feel it will be a great product."
"These bowls and lids are just exactly what I wanted. They were packed very welland arrived in great shape. Now I as a bachelor can experiment and make a lot of ""Mystery Casseroles."":-)>"
"I love that they are clear glass, but they are sturdy but not too heavy and that the lid snap on tightly. I think some of the lid should have steam vents but hey, it‚Äôs not that important! I mostly use them for storage, not reheating"
"So far I like the storage containers. I have only had them for about a week or so, my kitchen is pulled apart at the moment (because of some remodeling), but the containers (from the set) that I have used seem to be made of quality materials. Two are in the freezer with left over chili. and a few are in the fridge with other leftover things. I'm happy that the containers are a good step forward to becoming more organized in the kitchen."
Just got 2 sets of these. Terrific price. They have a really nice lip on them to hold when eating out of them. Yes they can chip if you're not careful with them. But they are glass and should be treated as such. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and can't wait to start meal prepping.
I was tired of all my plastic food storage containers so I tossed them and only use these now. I do wish there was at least one larger one included with the purchase.
I recently got rid of most of my plastic containers and replaced them with this set and I just love it! I noticed that food actually stays fresher for a longer period of time and I do like microwaving glass rather than plastic. You just can‚Äôt beat the price for this set. I‚Äôve put off buying glass containers due to the cost so I‚Äôm glad I came across this!
"I‚Äôve had other brands and they were very difficult to close . These are super easy to close, clean and store. I wish they all fit inside of eachother for storage . A couple are the same sizes so they don‚Äôt stack but they are great!"
Unboxing these look and feel like quality. I was pleasantly surprised by the 1tbsp size containers enclosed. I assume they are for condiments. The lids are easy to snap on and off and I filled them with water to test the leak proofness and not one drop escaped the rubber seal.
I like the way the lids lock securely in place. Also the lid as well as the container are very well and will last a very long time. It would have been nice to eliminate one smaller container and have a larger size added to the set instead.
These containers are great. I am so happy with them. I even had to make a special place in my kitchen for them - old plastic ones went to the donation box. Thank you for making a superior product.
"I've ordered this for a Christmas present and she loved them, so I ordered one for myself. I will not go back to any other storage containers because this is all you will need in different sizes of course. Love it enjoy"
These are great food storage and prep bowls. You can store food in refrigerator or freezer and can even microwave or heat in oven. No need to use a separate bowl to reheat food. The lid works great for a solid leakproof seal. I love this set.
"Es muy bueno para guardar el alimento saludablemente muy facil de limpiar, conserva los a√±imentos frescos, durabilidad y aprueba de perdidas."
"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about these is the inside seals come off and you have to put them back in. I love that they‚Äôre clear glass. I like to see my food in the fridge. The locks work great too. Overall, I‚Äôm pleased with these."
"I was tired of the same old plastic containers. You spend a fortune on them because of the price. But after you replace numerous sets of them, you realize it is more economic just to buy the good stuff. Very happy with this products."
Nice set however it came with a one year warranty but when you go to their website to give them your order number it doesn‚Äôt recognize it and that‚Äôs it. Other than that it a nice set. Well packaged. Every thing was just perfect except the warranty
i LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE GLASSWARE AND THE CAREFUL PACKAGING OF THE SET-I AM ON A VERY FIXED INCOME SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER SET-EXCELLENT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE
"I wanted glass so I could heat food directly in the oven or microwave. These are perfect. Lids are plastic and I hope they don‚Äôt warp over time. They fit snuggly, which is great; no worries about spills or leaks."
Get those horrible plastic containers out of your life. These are great from the fridge to the microwave. No need to worry about hormone disrupting chemicals leaching into your food.
"I‚Äôve been wanting to get rid of my old plastic Tupperware when I found these and they were totally worth it! Sure easy to clean (idk if you are supposed to put them in the dishwasher but I do and nothing bad has happened in the 6 months I‚Äôve owned them lol) and fully leakproof! The only downside is they take up more room to stack in the cupboard lol, but 10/10 recommend!"
"Had them for four months now, I really like them a lot better then plastic storage containers. Great in the fridge, I've frozen stuff in them. Great for the microwave, although I don't put the lids in there. Dishwasher safe. I actually ordered a second set."
"These won't hold much, but they're great for leftovers, meals or ingredients. The fact that they're glass makes it last longer and more microwave-safe than plastic containers. Plus they stack nicely when not in use."
Love how tight they click so you know they are truly leak proof. Love the fact that they are glass so spaghetti cannot stain the container. Plus easy to see what you are storing in them!
"They‚Äôre top quality, nice and heavy. Am looking forward to using them. I like that they have airtight lids that easily snap on. Seems like a great buy! Also, reasonably priced for the quality. Thank you."
All I can say is that they have outlasted my snapware. The hinges dont break due to regular reuse. I have also not experienced any leaks thus far. Worth the money.
"Really love these so far. The plastic pieces that actually hold the cover closed come off fairly easily and I do wonder if as time goes on if these will fail to hold, but over all really happy with the purchase as they seal well and do not leak."
"Love these. A little on the small side, so if you cook big meals to save you probably need to buy the bigger ones too. But these are great for small left overs & heating stuff up in the toaster oven!"
Only issue I have is the rubber sealers have to replaced when opening an empty container. Otherwise I am very pleased with this product. Great sizes!
"The glass containers are fairly durable, no chips or cracks yet after about a week of use. I handwash the lids and put the glass containers in the dishwasher. Definitely a good value for the price and was shipped promptly."
Seals tight and keeps things fresher longer! Must have for Foodies!
"Very sturdy, leak proof, dishwasher safe, and easy to clean !"
I highly recommend these! They are easy to clean can take very long times in the microwave. If you forget things in them in the fridge they do not keep a smell.
Quality is excellent. Love the lids. My wife has arthritis in her hands and the lids are easy for her to use. Excellent product at a good price. Love the lifetime warranty on the lids.
"These are amazing containers! I've been meaning to make the transition over to glass containers for a while and then I came across these, so glad that I did. A good amount for a fair price and amazing quality. The containers and lids feel very sturdy. Once I have more room I plan on purchasing more of these."
These containers are the best. The only thing I don't like is the rubber seal comes out when and you have to put it back after you wash it. But overall it's a great glass container.
Threw out all my old stuff ‚Äò bought these when we moved ! Love them & cleans up so good in the dishwasher ‚Ä¶ put leftovers in & stick in microwave to heat up ‚Ä¶
My hands are not strong the lids make them so much easier to use than the old lids that you had to burp. I can see in the clear glass and don't have to try and guess what is in the bowl. I make meals weekly so being able to fix what I want freeze it and then just grab from the freezer eat something I wanted instead of a mystery meal
So far so good. I Just received them and have already put them into use. Much better than the plastic ones I have used in the past.
Ir is what it is. I loved the sizes and quantity
So pleased with the quality of these containers
High quality glass- lids fit tightly but are easy to snap on and off. Containers can nest to save space.
"So far, these have been easy to clean and dishwasher proof. I prefer the glass container over the plastic containers. Items freeze well in these glass containers."
These are absolutely perfect containers. I love that they come in so many sizes. They lock and don‚Äôt spill.
"This SimpleHouseware Food Container Lid Organizer is freakin' awesome! I decided to use mine for both containers and their lids, and everything fits wonderfully. Way easier to access than the mess of stacks and piles I had before.  I like how it's adjustable based on my needs. Moving the dividers around takes a bit of practice and hand strength; someone with less hand strength might want to pass on this one. I'm always afraid I'm going to break a divider as I bend it in order to pull it out, but each time they've held up beautifully.  My only suggestion to improve it would be to have some way of storing dividers you aren't currently using on the organizer itself. After all, the entire point is to be organized and not have loose bits floating around. My lids are organized but now I have wandering dividers that I don't want to toss just in case I need them in the future!  That's my only quibble, though. Excellent product, sturdy but lightweight, does its job and looks great. 5 stars."
"This lid organizer is the single kitchen item I never knew I needed. Like most, our lids where everywhere. We‚Äôve stacked them, tossed them in a drawer, nestled them inside a bowl- whatever we could think of the wrangle them. Still a mess. This organizer is so simple and so easy but so effective. Just a tray with adjustable dividers that allows the lids to be stored upright. Perfect! It‚Äôs wider than I expected- the entire width of our cabinet shelf- but it fits and we‚Äôre happy with it!"
Simple tray and adjustable slots for the lids. Works for us!
LOVE THIS! No more mess!
"For what it does, it‚Äôs a solid product. The material used to build component is very good."
"I've decided to not use this wall-mounted. I'll explain why... the holes for mounting are in a position for the labeled top to slide out to the right. That's great. But that being the case, I think the labeling should be rotated so that when wall mounted, the words are not sideways / vertical. For this reason, I've opted to store this flat in a drawer because I prefer for the lettering to be in the normal position.  I also would have liked if the lettering was clearer / darker. The names are hard for me to read due to there being no color variation for the lettering, other than the natural variations in the wood at the time of the lettering indentation. As well, I would liked the words more centered with the storage openings, like shown in the product listing photos. On mine, only the ""gallon"" section label is centered with the opening - it's an OCD for me.  On the plus side, the overall engineering is well-done. The surface is smooth and has a nice feel to it. The shape of the organizer has not warped and the lid / cover slides in and out smoothly making access to each section very easy."

"Review for: BellaWorks Ziplock Bag Organizer - Bamboo Food Bag Storage Organizer Compatible with major brands and can store Gallon, Quart, Sandwich and Snack Size Bags| Great for Kitchen Drawer, Pantry & Cupboards organization  I picked up both this and their foil and plastic wrap holder. I like how each is divided out. You can even double up on some but then you'll be annoyed they're mislabeled. It looks pretty nice and professional. It does have some dust from creating you might need to sand it down a little. Otherwise, I love this concept that you can both mount or put it in a drawer which the second is the most likely scenario."
I don't know why I waited so long on one of these! Super easy to use and it very well made and stylish. The cost is comparable to others our there so this would be a safe/good buy.
"First of all, the package arrived in great condition, the seller wrap it very nicely, with foams! The best thing about this egg holder is that, I don‚Äôt have to take many other stuff out from the fridge in order to grab an egg! My Fridge is stacked most of the time so this is a real time saver! It also save space as you can put other things on top of it (even heavyweights like glass containers). Besides, it holds more eggs than I thought! The picture I show has 24 eggs and there is still room for another 10 eggs! High-quality product, I love it!"
"Love this egg holder. great quality and serves its purpose. We have lots of things in our fridge. With this egg holder, I can stack other things on top, and still so easy to take eggs out."
"It is very easy to use, making my refrigerator is more organized. Highly recommended."
""

"This can hold up to 18 eggs comfortably. The tray is tilted so you can grab and egg from the front and the rest roll forward. The lid lifts up but the front is also open so you can grab an egg without having to open anything. The lid is also very sturdy and you can put other stuff on top of it. The tray is silicone which is a nice touch. Overall, great product!"
"This is a nice egg organizer. It‚Äôs sturdy and made of good quality which protects the eggs. Putting the eggs in this organizer makes it easier to assess them quickly. Once an egg is removed, another slides down in its place. That‚Äôs cool. Having them in here makes them look so neater. I would definitely this product."
""
This offers such a great aesthetic and storage for your kitchen.  Easy to clean and assemble. ü•öü•öü•ö
I accidentally noticed this product and ordered it to make eggs packed more organized in my refrigerator. It is very efficient to have eggs automatic scrolling to the front ... and it is worth the money!
"I purchased rainbow pouches that I needed to put misc items in for when I ship them. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the size at first or if it would fit. I also thought they might‚Äôve been flimsy. I was very happy to see when I received them that they not only were thick and very durable, but they were absolutely cute and more than 1 item fit in these pouches. Great for makeup storage or to separate makeup if selling. The smaller size was also very useful since we offer smaller items as well. Definitely would purchase again."
"These resealable holographic Mylar bags are fantastic!!! They come in various sizes to meet any need you may have. They are very durable, thick and can even be reused. I have used them to give nice thank you gift bags of candy, treats, handmade jewelry and cookies to people who have been working hard and being extra nice especially during the coronavirus time. The bags seal securely and have a nice clear front that displays the special gift. The back side adds luster to make whatever is enclosed look nicer and brighter. I would highly recommend purchasing these bags. They have come in handy for so many things and I will definitely purchase more in the future. The price is fabulous and I know you will be totally pleased. They are a great value for your money."
"Great Seller, the product is beautiful, my customers love this packaging for their cards. Has a nice zip lock seal, with a great colorful rainbow holographic sheen on it. These bags are thick, durable and is the best value for the money hands down, I will be returning to purchase more in the near future from this seller. Thank you."
""
"Loved these halo baggie packages. I used them for my home made lip balms and lip gloss. People who received my items loved them too! They seal Nice and have a tab for it to be ripped open, but will also re close. It makes your product look professionally sealed and packaged. I will order again."
These are absolutely stunning with the rainbow effect and also perfect for anyone with a small business! I have tried multiple options and so far this one has been the absolute best! They came in a timely manner and my customers are absolutely in love! They give a sleek elegant look to items when being used to package items for your small business! I would one hundred percent highly recommend these bags and this company! You won‚Äôt regret buying these! They are amazing value for the money and extremely durable!
"Amazing product! Super shiny, and awesome. All my clients love them. I use them for product samples at my spa. It comes in assorted sizes, so you don't need to buy multiple packs! If you're still hesitant, don't be...these are truly awesome!!!"

Loved everything about the order very sweet n helpfull thank you for my order it was shipped fast with no problems. I cant wait to order again. These were perfect for my new resin keychains business I'm starting. There so shiny n colorful definitely designed to catch customers eye. In so excited to get my business started n I get use this packaging n cant wait to order more .Thank you again for the order will definitely be buying again
These were perfect for what I needed them for. Both sizes worked for each item I expected them to work for. The smaller size was perfect for my keys and the bigger size was great for my sets. Not only was the quality perfect the bags are so cute. I definitely will be placing another order soon. You have gotten a permanent customer. Thanks for excellent custom service .
I absolutely love these bags I used them to add products and accessories to go along with the lip gloss my daughter has created. I really enjoy the fact that they send a free gift as well so I was able to make little mini bags as a second option.
"4*6&3*4 It did not fit my eyelashes in the pack, so if that's what you're using it for get a bigger size. Won't zip. Other than that they are perfect, not thin or anything. I'll find something else to store in them."
"I will definitely be buying more. Been wanting these for a while in different sizes, and the piece is perfect. Great durability, comes with labels, and three different sizes which it‚Äôs perfect for the items I sell. Plus it‚Äôs ziplock so you can reuse them as needed. And then if you wanted you can seal up the top for extra security depending on what you put inside them. Definitely worth buying."
"I got these for my daughter for her to package some of her resin key chains in. We both love them, they are really good quality have a very professional look"
"This is a really great offer I have a business and I use these for keychains,makeup,and other stuff they are so pretty color is the best part if you put anything in it will make it look really nice. I will definitely be buying more of these they come in different sizes they are reusable they are great."
Very nice product! I like the different sizes of the packages as well as the colors! Wasn't expecting it to be so nice! They company when three in a gift for me! Amazing company I will be shopping with them again! I am very impressed! Thank you so much!
I ordered this cute little bags to put items in that would go into a quincea√±era pi√±ata. That way small items would be easier to find! I really likes the quality and sizes!
Love these bags! They are wide and deep and have depth. Bulky food items lay nicely in the bags and they have a nice airtight seal. We use them when we make gummies and they stay fresh for a couple months because of the seal. The holographic bag really brings out the color of the gummies. Highly recommend.
Nice sturdy well-sized bags for storing spices. I use them to save space instead of having half-full bulky spice containers on the shelf.
These are great for storage. I use them for snacks for my Grandkids. They seem to keep the food fresh. I will buy more for camping. I love that they have different sizes
These were perfect for my pop sockets. As well as my pieces of candy I send in each order. I love the holographic look of them and so do my customers.. I will be ordering again very soon they came way faster than I expected as well. I thought it was gonna be a few days not the next. I greatly appreciate the fast shipping and great bags I got from you.
"Very nice and cute pouches! I bought 3x4"" and 4x6"" bags.. The pouches are thick and have good quality.. and they also come with so many for a great price. They can be used for many purposes, I use them for my small business. They are Perfect for my keychain packaging, see through window made the items inside look great. Definitely will order again!"
I love how there are different sizes! This product is amazing and durability. It is definitely value for the money I was surprised that I received smaller ones and I am so happy I did. It comes with small and large bags with labels ! Shipping came quick and I will definitely be purchasing again!
The holographic resealable mylar bags I purchased were exactly what was expected. They were priced reasonably well and I was given samples of a different size when I received the order. It shipped quickly and they were packaged nicely! Overall very pleased with product and I will be purchasing again from this company and the products!

"I absolutely LOVE this product!! The holographic shine is just amazing and they are super durable. It is a super great size, too! I love the different sizes, that is going to be so so SO helpful for my small business. Overall they are just so cute and I couldn't be happier. Also, it came with a sticker pack and a chance to get a free gift card. So cool!"
Let me just say!! This was worth my money was honestly on time and very helpful for my small business!! I love how the holographic it is it makes my products stand out more!! Very worth it!! Love love it
I use these for my eyes lashes and lip glosses that I sell they are super cute and work amazing
If i could give these a 10 stars i absolutely would. They are true to size and so durable. I‚Äôve used these for many different reason and it just gives my packaging a pop of fun that i truly love. They can hold a good amount of candy or even lipgloss and chapsticks. I defiantly recommend this beautiful packaging.
"These did not disappoint me. I loved the design of the bags and also the size. Definitely worth your money. Great for small businesses and other things also. These bags definitely helped me out a lot, I will most definitely buy these again. Great product. Go get yours now. Thanks again"
I needed these for my chocolate candies that I sale they are super pretty very durable easy to open! They definitely complimented my candies very nicely I will be purchasing again I love that you get two different sizes and the price is reasonable these will definitely help your brand and products look professional
Nice but had to return didn‚Äôt match my other packaging.
I run a small coffee business and these are perfect for sample sized giveaways and even for personal storage as they keep the coffee and other food products fresh and most importantly keep the original flavor! Highly recommend!
I love these bags my products fit perfectly in them. I love the look and so do my customers. There quality is amazing and these for my go to bags from now on.
I just wanna start by saying this order was amazing !! I am so proud of what has came in today it is exactly how it looks and it is the perfect size for what I‚Äôm using it for ! Thank you so much .
Best bags ever!
Nice
I really love my order you are the best. I will recommend to others as well as ordering again soon
I love these! They are perfect for so many things!
Perfecto
A little smaller than I expected but it still works with my packaging.
"My absolute favorite packaging, such good quality I really recommend you buying these"
It's good for my small and medium hair stuff. I love it. Thanks you.
Great bags for lip gloss the little ones that they bring fits honey tubes great and the bigger ones fit 20ml tubes great.
I love them they are amazing and my lashes fit in them perfectly you should definitely get them ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautifully packaged perfect for small businesses I will be rebuying from this company CONSTANTLY!!!!

Perfect
Just like the picture. Very good quality
The bags work well and I used for food and hair products so far.

Loved that it came with two option sizes and labels
I like it a lot. It's worth buying.
I love the quality of it an it‚Äôs very pretty
Loved them!
Perfect for my sample bags! Exactly what I wanted!
Dope! Fits exactly what I needed them for. I use them for my business!
Perfecta para guardar cosas liquidas
I like that they seal your items in place safe..I also like the design of the bag
"The bags seemed great at first, but the zippers tend to break when you reseal and open them. They would be okay for using once, but if you plan to reseal them, get different ones."
These was ok. The small ones I can‚Äôt fit anything in them really and the other size was just ok.
I love the packaging and they are so shiny. I just didn‚Äôt like the 20 pack of the small. I bought these so I can make homemade candy.
doesnt fit my eyelash cases!!! sad but i made it work! theyre cute!
Smaller than expected.
Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a ‚Äúone off‚Äù defect.
The lids to not fit - you can get maybe two sides down and that is it. I also on two occasions found glass in my food. I had to toss the entire set. Surprising since it is an Amazon product.
"Between my teenagers and my 96 yo mother, given the scare about the toxins emitted from heating food in plastic, we tossed it all. This is one of the best all-around alternatives I've found. The lids lock on, and so they are a little difficult for my mother.  Two great things: that cabinet of plastics with the ever disappearing lids is clean, and I can rest assured at least this part of our daily living is more healthy."
"We have been trying to reduce our plastic use so we bought these. One of my bowls must have had a crack in it and shattered on top of my hand as I was getting it out of the cabinet. This glass breaks in very sharp shards. A severed tendon and a surgery later, I am out of work for several weeks and should regain mobility after a year of PT. I am now switching out all of my glass to reusable silicone. If you have this product, please be careful! This has been a very painful and expensive experience and I just want to prevent any one else from getting hurt."
"I read a number of the reviews of this product prior to purchasing and in all honesty had decided not too...except a friend of mine had glass dishes I really loved and when I aske her, she said this was the set she got. I decided to give them a try. Mine came well packaged and everything was in one piece. I haven't had any trouble with chipping so far (it's been about a week). I do only wash the lids by hand, never in the dishwasher, and they fit securely. You do need to apply a bit of pressure to get them open but that serves to prevent leaks. So far so good, I'll update this in about 3 months. --- So it's been 3 months and these have held up well. I am extra careful with them and I still only wash the lids by hand. I have been really pleased and would purchase again and recommend."
"Bought the 10 piece set, two of which came broken."
"I ordered these in January so I‚Äôd had them for about 7 months. I carry them to work almost everyday. I was fully expecting them to spill so I‚Äôd always put them in a waterproof/spill proof lunch box in my backpack to take to work. To my surprise, in the entire 7 months I‚Äôve had them they‚Äôve never spilled. I finally (surprised it took my clumsy self this long) dropped one of these. I dropped one of the bowls off the counter and saw it landing an inch away from my bare foot. I saw the life of my toes flash before my eyes. Sure enough, it just bounced around and didn‚Äôt even crack. We‚Äôre talking 3-4 feet off the counter on to the floor... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!? I‚Äôve both hand washed and ran these through the dishwasher and the seal is still A1. 15/10 recommend if you‚Äôre clumsy or don‚Äôt want your lunch all in your bag."
"Too difficult to open. If you have arthritis, stay away!"
"After my kids basically destroyed my plastic containers in the microwave and I could no longer scrub the tomato sauce red colour out, I knew it was time to get some glass containers. I was nervous about buying this ‚ÄúAmazon Basics‚Äù brand but am not disappointed with my purchase. These work well in the fridge, microwave and freezer. But just make sure you take the container out of the fridge and let it warm up slightly before putting it directly in the microwave. I‚Äôd not only buy these again but will look at other items to purchase from Amazon Basics."
"I LOVE these! Would highly recommend. Not only are they glass and so much better to use them plastic, they are completely airtight. Microwave so well. Clean so well. Also they look nice. I put these out when I have people over, and the glass bowls look very presentable. And it makes for an easy cleanup just to put the lids on in a Safeway and put it right in the fridge. I bought two packs of these because I‚Äôm that obsessed with this product!!  Very very durable, and I would highly recommend for any glassware. Not to mention the price is absolutely amazing!"
"Our fridge used to look like the food pantry blew up. I used to buy the cheapo plastic stuff you find at ""the mart"". I have lots of those left, with no lids, or lids with no same-size containers. Sound familiar? Every heat up leftover spaghetti sauce in a plastic container unthinkingly and now it looks like it has the blight? That will never come off. These glass containers are A.M.A.Z.I.N.G - and no, I'm not getting paid for this review - I wish I were. Our fridge is so well organized now, and you can heat up food in these heavy-duty glass containers no problemo. The lids are hard to loose, so we have not ended up with a lot of mismatched lid/containers. We love these darn things."
the lids are too weak and they break
"Ordered these and a similar set from Pyrex; these are better! However, I‚Äôm not sure the side-locking lids will stand the test of time (one has already broken). I have an old Pyrex set with stretch lids that seem more durable over the long haul (and easier to clean). I‚Äôve had those for 10+ years with no breakage. But these lids are better for storage / transporting food (they‚Äôre more leak proof). Hope this helps!"
"in all honesty, I was a tad bit hesitant to purchase an AmazonBasics product. For some reason I am trained to believe a generic Amazon brand cannot live up to Pyrex or Glasslock. BLOWN AWAY! Words that are not usually synonyms with storage containers. Starting with the shipping box- apart from a personal disdain for styrofoam - the simple/straightforward packaging was delivered with pieces resting inside each other along with a Care For slip was free of any other fluff to distract from the products. very nice. The products were lined with thin foam to prevent accidents during shipping, and the lids were shrink wrapped. After a rinse and soak in some bleach water, I removed the silicone rings air dried and put up for storage. I noticed that when cleaning water was getting under the glass lip on the outside, which added a few seconds to the cleaning process.  My first use of the product was taking lunch to work. very secure, very leakproof, and easy to heat. Overall the design, ease of use, BPA free traits have made these containters my new go to for any meal prep or food storage."
Being retired and single this is perfect for cooking a large quantity and freezing into smaller portions for me. I prefer glass containers because they go from freezer to oven. Easy to clean and when someone else shows up it's easy to take another out of the freezer. Great gift too!
"These are not the best space-saving dishes, but they are sturdy and definitely with a tight fit. I'm impressed that you can easily remove the gasket inside as well and throw all in the dishwasher WARNING: If you have serious arthritis in your hands, I wouldn't recommend. They are hard to close, and harder to open. I can still appreciate, as see being able to pack them despite the weight knowing they won't spill. GREAT OVERALL!"
"This is a great set and certainly equal to other more pricey brands. This is a set, so do be aware of the sizes, some of these dishes are on the small size, which is perfect for me as I am single. They are great for leftovers and lunches, and heat better in the microwave than plastic dishes do. They also hold the heat, so you don't feel like you have to race through your leftovers to eat them while they are still hot. I highly recommend these to everyone!"
Very pleased with these glass storage containers. The plastic tops sit on the glass lip securely and lock in place. Pleased with the items. They are dishwasher safe I am sure but I hand wash as I do not want any plastic warping and it takes just a few seconds.
"Needed storage containers for my Lake House. These are high quality, glass, with solid plastic lids. Leak proof. Much better tha similar plastic storage containers. Very inpressed with the quality. Go with GLASS. Ran them through the dishwaher before first use. Great product."
"We have some OXO bowls (similar to these) and the only difference I can find is a little lid tab (on the OXO). These bowls, in the variety of sizes) are proving themselves invaluable, saving much needed cabinet space and eliminating lots of plastic bowls ü§ó A great value for a great price!!"
The first package I received was damaged with half the lids cracked. Amazon customer service was great and I got a new set. The new set works well. Sometimes they seal so well they can be difficult to open. No issue for me but might make if difficult for others. Overall I plan to buy more to expand my collection. Do wish amazon offered a set of bigger containers as these are not large enough to pack a whole dinners leftovers or a salad in. The small ones are perfect for single serving and the large you can put a small meal in.
Love these containers these are way better than using stinking plastic containers they keep the food fresher plus they're easy to clean and you don't have to worry about odors from the previous food being in the container contaminating food that you put in the container later because it's glass
"These glass storage containers with locking lids are great! Very durable and clean up is a breeze. If I have to scrub food off, I just soak the container in hot, soapy water and that does the job. I like that you can storage food and use the same container to microwave the food and even eat right out of the container. The lids seal perfectly so I am very happy with this product. The items came when promised and I would buy from this seller again without hesitation."
This was my first set of this type of storage item. I was surprised how tightly the lids close and so easily opened. The glass is much more sanitary than the plastic I was using and easier to clean too. A great guy all in all and the assorted sizes are wonderful.
Keeps fruit lasting longer. I had blueberries and Raspberries transferred into these glass containers with a paper towel on bottom to absorb extra water and the fruit lasted 2 weeks longer than usual!! I freaking LOVE these! Completely leakproof
"I recently changed all my plastic to glass.... and what a life changing decision!!!! my food taste so much better, takes a while to go bad, holds in all the flavor, does not have that plastic taste. And its so so easy to clean, i love this so much! will be purchasing more in the future"
"dishes are great for baking and microwave, rather than plastic in the microwave. Then to also have a lid that fits snugly - it's great!"
It's holding up very well. I dropped one and it didn't break and the lids are holding up well to freezing and heating. I will say the lids are very hard to lock and open. Someone with hand problems like arthritis or such will have a hard time locking them and opening them.
"My daughter convinced me to try these and throw out all my mismatched plastic containers. So glad I did. These are great in every way -- perfect sizes, lids aren't cheapo, stack nicely. So unusual to open my cupboards and have my storage containers nice and tidy!!"
"These seal very tightly, look great and are just what I wanted to get away from using anything disposable. I am very pleased with the function, the quality, and the design. Will likely buy a second set."
Am giving up plastic storage containers due to the leeching issues. These are perfectly sized and make warming leftovers in the microwave a breeze. Easy to clean and doesn't stain like plastic.
"Exactly what I needed! Ordered a set for my daughter to take to her college dorm. When she decided to study from home this semester. I tried them out and loved them! They are a nice weight glass (not flimsy), perfect size to portion meals and leftovers, and easy to clean (dishwasher safe). Highly recommend."
I've had snapware for many years and liked it until they changed the seal they used which never worked well and now pyrex bought them.  But this from amazon uses the well made snapware gasket design which is really good and really seals the lid.
"I love these containers because the lids are easy to lock. I freeze in them, use in the microwave and use them to store in the refrigerator."
I love that they are the perfect size for snacks or left over meals. My only dislike is that the set does not come with an extra large lasagna pan.
I love them and very sturdy. I drop one on the floor and it didn‚Äôt break or chip. Nothing happened
My cut up veggies last so much longer when stored in one of these in the fridg. I got tired of the plastic containers as they don't last long before the inside starts to peel. One thing I don't like (and this is low on my list) is you can't take from fridg and heat the contents or it risks breakage .
"Really like the sizes and quality of the glass‚Äî‚Äîthick. The lids can be hard to secure, but I think once I use them often enough, they‚Äôll be fine. Otherwise, I just use my ‚Äúshower cap‚Äù covers. This was my final step in revising my kitchen food containers from plastic to glass."
Just what I was looking for. Have a different brand I bought years ago and wanted more but couldn't find the same brand. Got these and they are great. Like the sizes. Easy to clean. Great price.
"Works as advertised - probably better. Very secure positive seal, easy to clean."
Love the glass containers. I was using plastic but it doesn‚Äôt keep its shape if washed in the dishwasher. Lids disappear and that creates a problem. So I went to glass. Glass keeps its shape and for some reason pieces don‚Äôt disappear. The dishwasher does a great job of cleaning.
"amazon putitsnameon this product for good reason, high quality, many pieces, glass can go from fridge to microwave."
"Love these containers. I have always used glass, do not like plastic. The lids are little difficult to open and close as a have severe arthritis but it doesn't deter me."
"These are some heavy duty storage containers. The lids are very tightly fitted, so you know contents won't leak out. Very nice set of containers!"
The covers can be hard to deal with but they are air tight. The glass containers are perfect for everything.
"I've been using this set for some time now, and I am loving it! It's easy to clean, stores everything airtight, and is super convenient to heat my food in (my job doesn't have a microwave but we have a toaster oven)! I would absolutely recommend these over their plastic counterparts. They'll last forever!"
"My friend suggested these when I was looking for containers. I really love them. Good size selection, leak proof, dishwasher safe which was a must for me. Not too hard for my kids to close the lids."
These work great in the microwave. The lids lock 100% airtight and don't absorb color/flavor (I nuke veges w/ curry & Sriracha all the time). I also use the large container as cigar humidor and it's better than expensive wood humidors.
Awesome glass storage. Can be a bit tough to close lids but it works. Should of bought another set. Love them!
"I like the set of glass containers and got a fairly good deal on them. My only wish is that they were oven-safe to 450¬∞+ like Pyrex. I‚Äôve used a couple of them, but there was no deforming from the dishwasher to the lids like I see on my Pyrex bowl lids when I dry with heat."
Love these durable glass containers with snap down leak proof plastic lids. Glass container is dishwasher proof but prefer to wash lids in sink to prevent warping of plastic lids. Great improvement from snap on lids.
"I decided I was no longer going to use plastic bowls for work. Tried of bowls melting inside and staining. These were the answer, never stane or melt. Able to heat up in microwave and seal great , no leaks. Only issue is they could be heavy to carry but no pain no gain."
"We routinely have leftovers and we almost always take breakfast and lunch to work so quality containers are key for us.  The variety of sizes and no leak tops are great, and we‚Äôve learned that glass is better than plastic for durability and cleaning"
Love these! And the multiple size selection was portioned out perfect! I‚Äôve thrown away all plastic and transitioned to all glass! Side not: Tip: they are hard to open at first but I am noticing now they are loosening up. Just beware of this and use the side of your fingers not the tips so you don‚Äôt break a nail :)
"The lock feature almost locks too tight, but hey, better that than too loose. These are high quality and worth every penny. I'm tired of stained tupperware type storage containers and trying to get tomato sauce out of them, and these aren't that much more expensive. I'm sold."
These suckers will clamp down and seal great. Seal so well that when you remove the lid you have to remove the seal from the container to put back in the lid. This works out though because then you can make sure you are get all of the seal clean and not just the parts that are exposed to air.
Feels a little light and thin but seems durable. Have not chipped. Tight seal. But some liquid still makes its way out. Not a significant amount though.
I love the different sizes and what I can use them for mostly for storage in my kitchen.
"I‚Äôve used these for over a month now and I wish I had purchased them sooner! They are a thicker glass, though I am careful with them, and have a very tight seal when they are closed properly. I have to say I am a big fan. If anything happens I‚Äôll update the review."
This is a very versatile set. It is microwavable and easy to clean. These were the two things I wanted and why I got rid of a lot of my other containers.
"Brought as an Xmas gift. MNL loves them. She‚Äôs cooks A lot, and always has leftovers. These come in handy as they are very durable."
I had purchased these for myself in the past and liked them so well that I ordered some as a wedding gift!
Built very well and exactly what we needed to get rid of our plastic food storage. These are very nice looking and a much healthier choice.
"The packaging is exceptional. Very secure. The items are a perfect fit and solid for liquids. The containers are scent tight, air tight, and inhibit feezer burn. The glass is thick and durable."
They are the best for storing leftovers. They don't turn colors like plastic storage containers do if you have a tomato food you are storing. My daughter-in-law gave me a set. I have enjoyed them and my mother saw them and wanted some so l ordered this set.
Easy to clean. Durable. Pretty. Why pay more?
My daughter decided to move out from her mother's house (daughter is in her second year of law school) and move to an apartment very close to where I live. One of the items she asked for her birthday was some Tupperware storage containers. I decided to go with the Amazon Basics alternative since she enjoys cooking and frankly glass is a better storage option than plastic. She was very happy with the choice...
"I love that they can go in dishwasher, top shelf I‚Äôm been very pleased, great product"
they are very nice!
I use these for leftovers mostly but also use for vegetables and fruit. They are durable but they are glass also.
"I didn't really read the description much when I ordered except to see there were different sizes I needed after I had gone through my fake TW cabinet and threw out containers without lids and lids without containers. I was blown away when I saw the little containers, especially the square ones that I found out are great for salad dressing if you want to take it with you or you need it for leftover dressing from a package you cannot close! Would definitely recommend these (and that you clean out your container cabinet)!"
I love these because they are perfectly square and fit in my freezer with no wasted space. Additionally they are BPA free and quite sturdy. I use them to freeze meals for my daughters and other family members. If I do not get them back it is no big deal because they are inexpensive. I will be purchasing more in the future.
"These are actually leakproof. They are really nice and I can even throw soup in my bag (on the bottom of my bag with crap on top) and not worry about leaking, And thats with an 1.5hr commute to work everyday and using the square shaped containers"
"We've tried many brands, shapes and sizes over the decades. These come in good sizes for all our leftovers and to fit in the refrigerator. I'm giving away all the other brands and standardizing to these."
Nice product
Great assortment for a fabulous price. At this price you can give them to your party guests with leftovers and not worry about getting the containers back.
"Have tried some others, since my 1st purchase of this brand. Ziplocs are more durable and seal better."
"I love the product, but have one suggestion in softening the squared off corners of the kids so that they are less prone to breaking off."
Good. Broken when they fall down on tile
"I like its sealing feature, its stackability, and sturdiness."
I love the variety of sizes with this pack. Although the lids do seem a little flimsy. I hope they hold up in the dishwasher!
This was a gift to someone else
THIS PACK HAS ALL THE GREAT SIZES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"I received the items , all containers and lids seem to be there. I like that there are different sizes to store different amounts and types of food."
As described. Cut down on single use containers! Thanks
"I like this set so much, that I ordered a second set. This is perfect for my food prep and storage. Stacks neatly in the fridge, and keeps things fresh."
Work for me
Very nice set! Great sizes!
I like the variety pack. Great starter kit
"I‚Äôve become so reliant on these food storage items. and the great thing about it, it‚Äôs all BPA Free! ."
The best
Containers are very useful and inexpensive
good purchase
Good. Love like want there product.üéâüòä
Good selection of containers.
Great for everyday
Was good for Christmas leftovers. Love all the different sizes.
love em
love my container
"I like the number of sizes, sturdiness, and tops for each piece."
One of my favorite containers to use.
A must have! Also an added bonus they‚Äôre dishwasher safe
Love the different sizes
Nice
Items arrived as expected. These containers are perfect for lunches!
Great purchase!
very good
"These containers are more for packing a lunch. You can‚Äôt easily fit dinner leftovers into these- which is what I wanted them for. The tiny little containers would work well for salad dressing. The round containers are cool because they have a screw top lids (which are very sturdy), but again, they‚Äôre not super big. You can also tell that the square lids are fragile. I haven‚Äôt broken any of them because I‚Äôve been careful and mindful of that, but if you‚Äôre going to town on one of these lids it will definitely crack. Washes well in dishwasher!"
I've been buying their containers for years. I love them. I haven't found any other containers that I love as much and they don't take a lot of room in the cabinet.  Update : 8-30-2021 I just ordered another set because mine was getting worn out they have changed the design. I'm having to change my review from a 5 star to a 1 star. If I close the lid it pops open on one side close down that side it pops open on the other they are empty and haven't even been washed so it's not steam causing it. The new design is odd and also takes up more space and the plastic is very thin and doesn't feel sturdy at all. After many years of buying their containers I shall be looking into other brands.
"I love using these for meal prepping. I have other containers, but having these in a square design makes for super easy fridge storage. The do tend to stain with tomato sauce and sometimes have a film on the plastic after washing that grosses me out a bit. Like a pale dusty white film when I pull it out of the cabinet. I have to wipe them/rewash before use. Not always, just sometimes. It's weird. Might be dishwasher related, I probably need more jet dry or something. I buy these as my main container storage."
"My mistake for not doing better math I suppose. The way the quantities are presented in pictures of the packing a person would easily think they are getting 8 each of two types and 4 each of the other two types. It wasn‚Äôt until they arrived and I read a very small print that you would‚Äôve had to zoom in on to notice that they were counting the lids as an item in the total count. You‚Äôre really only getting 2 of the one type, and 4 of the other type. I‚Äôm pretty sure I could‚Äôve gotten this amount way cheaper. But I needed them right then so I kept them. Counting the lids as an item on something that should obviously include a lid as standard practice is being purposely deceiving in my eyes. I‚Äôm sure they present it this way on purpose counting on people exactly like me."
"I should have read reviews but didn't think it necessary for food storage containers. The original design was absolute square, not rounded. I even checked the SKU on the box and older unboxing videos show the same SKU with the original design. SO, same SKU, but the design changed completely at some point.  I am a person that prefers to stick with one design style rather than mix and match.  Then I find that they could not be returned.  Interestingly, I just looked. They updated the picture at the top of the page for this, but if you scroll down, you see the old packaging with the old design. SMH"
The plastic boxes were ok quality. There are definitely more better container products out there. I was personally looking for more boxes and reasonable price as I started living by myself. And this one worked for me but is not the best quality. If I use it for currys and such it would stick and not get cleaned properly.
"I couldn't believe how small these were when they arrived today. From the description, I expected them to be bigger. There is no way you would fit 1.25 quarts or a pint in the larger ones. The most you could fit in there is a single sandwich. They should give the product dimensions in inches instead so you would know what you're getting. Very misleading."
"Changes in the design mean these don‚Äôt stack well in my cupboard with my others. I‚Äôve also found the covers don‚Äôt fit well. Put two corners down, click the third corner down, and when you move to the fourth corner, the opposite side will sometimes come up - or worse- the whole side of the container collapses. 100% would not buy again"
"The product description says these are the SmartLoc containers/lids, but I got the regular lids and it says it's not eligible for return when I go into my orders. False advertising. Product is okay I guess if you don't want SmartLoc."
The containers are just fine
"Ziplock has changed it‚Äôs design ever so slightly - not sure why. I ordered these as ‚Äúbuy it again‚Äù, but the containers were a slightly different size. So now nothing stacks well in my drawers because I have half old design and half new design. So annoying! And the leakiness of the containers is EXACTLY the same."
Ziploc usually makes my favorite food containers. These have a different type of cover from those I buy in the grocery store. These warp after two or three times in the dishwasher and don‚Äôt reseal easily. Not good quality and not the same as I‚Äôve purchased many times in stores.
The majority of this set is trash. The sealing is terrible on the two largest sizes and the plastic is thin enough it bows when trying to seal the container. I won't be buying ziploc again unless they go back to making a descent design.
The lid broke to easily after being in the refrigerator for 2 days.
"Not great product , they are week and they break up easily , specially the smaller sizes"
"So as the ad says It's microwave safe, it's not. I put my food in one of the the containers and put it in the microwave and the container not only ruined my food but also melted the container. Super pissed."
These are flimsy and don't always stay shut
""
"After only a few weeks of use we‚Äôve had to toss at least a third of the containers for cracked lids, bottoms of both. Plastic seems very brittle and breaks extremely easily. Definitely would not repurchase."
""
Box was crushed and lids missing!
No
These Ziploc 24 count packages only have 10 containers and 10 lids. The replacement had the same problem. Both returning!
GARBAGE. DONT BUY!! They break so easily. The tab to open Rips right off the first time you use them. Total trash. Save your money and upgrade.
Purchased DEC. 2020 and I just got in and none of the lids fit any of the containers!!
"The lids only fit some of the containers! Such a joke. If the containers don‚Äôt have a lid, what‚Äôs the point?"
"These containers wete not as sturdy as I expected. They work, but the lids are flimsy."
The lids are cheap/ to brittle. Already brooke 3 lids just trying to open a container that was in fridge. Threw the rest away and went back to glad containers
Unhappy!!!There were NO lids for the smaller containers!!!
"The redesigned Ziploc containers are garbage. The lids won't stay on. With the new rounded design, they don't sit side-by-side so they take up much more room than the old design. They are thinner plastic, weaker, and in every way worse than the old design. GARBAGE!"
The old Ziploc containers stacked very well - using much less space. These take up much more cabinet (4 containers now take up the space that 8 containers used to) space. Still seal as tightly as the old - no change there.
The box they came in was damaged but every item was in perfect condition!! This is the second set of these we have purchased and we will be purchasing another one soon!
They work great. No leaks.
"I like that these items stack and nest nicely, so I will keep the set. The sizes are useful to me. However, this is NOT WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE LISTING, and I am not the first reviewer to point this out, which is why I give it only 1 star. You will receive: 6 1/2 cup tiny containers good for nuts, dressing, etc. (Description is 5); 6 1 1/4 cup(Description is 5); 6 2-cup (Description is 5); 5 3-cup (Description is correct); 4 5-cup (Description is correct); 2 7-cup (Description is 3); 1 9-cup (Description is 2). There is NO 14 cup container as described in the listing. The containers themselves are as described, they seal nicely, stack and nest nicely. BUT KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT RECEIVING THE SET DESCRIBED and buy if you want more of the smaller sizes that I listed, and none of the largest size! 1 star for false description."
"I have a lot of these containers. I love them. But now it's hard to find the original tops without a steam vent. Some moron changed the design of the solid lids to incorporate a steam vent that can loosen, break, and is just a bad idea. Do you want a vent? Just crack open the old lid. Now I hunt down the old design on eBay because I won't be buying this design."
Beware only four large kids are vented!!! Pictures and descriptions are not accurate with regards to all size lids being vented. These take forever to dry whether washed by hands or in dishwasher. I would have passed on this set if I had known all the lids were not vented. This is deceptive advertising and amazon needs to rectify the picture showing all size lids are vented as well as the description. Other reviewers have noted similar misleading info on which lids are vented.
As a number of reviewers pointed out... This set consist primarily of small containers. By looking at the images I was under the impression that this set had a few large ones and 6 of the most common size that I use. Turns out the majority are only good for holding half a pack of m&m's. Beware.
"This is an example of over engineering &/or the common misconception that one has to make something new to make it better, which is obviously false. These containers were perfect without vent mechanism, now theyre worse. The mechanism housing the vent on the inside of the lid obviously takes space & it uses space inside the container to do so, which takes space from whatever one wants to store in the container - which is the purpose of the container & even more stupid is that venting could be done without the useless mechanism by partially opening the lid ya numpties. Not only that but the lids dont even snap together correctly anymore & probably because of that stupid vent switch. rubbermaid, get rid of the vent switch - its unneeded & a hindrance. Or at least sell the lids without the vent switch."
"I bought a set of these 6 years ago and they were great, held up well. They started getting a little stained and not look so nice after so much use. So I decided it was time to buy a fresh set. Upon receiving these I was greatly disappointed to see, like so many things, they have greatly lowered the quality. The clear bowels are about half the thickness of the old and the red lids seem to be a brittle plastic and not as rugged as the old. I can see these not lasting half as long as our old ones. I will keep using our old better quality ones and will be returning these half rate new ones."
"I purchased this set ages ago when I got sick of having plastic containers and thousands of lids. With only 3-4 lid sizes it makes things so much easier. Then on Prime Day I saw this set on sale which was the exact same set I previously had and loved but it had this new vent hole.  So I purchased them and I have to say the vent hole is really nice. I wouldn't microwave things in them before because I had bad experiences with previous products but I tried it with the vent hole and they work great! The containers are the same high-quality containers as before where they don't absorb colors or yellow with use.  The only oddity is the vent cover has some sort of snapping mechanism instead of being a flimsy flap. That's great but it adds more nooks and crannies to the lid and makes them a bit harder to clean.  I don't have or can't afford a dishwasher as much as I'd love one so it's difficult to wash these by hand really well. I have a tiny bottle brush I end up using most of the time. But overall these are great containers, they stack, and are compatible with the older lids and vice versa so I don't have any issues with them at all. 5-Star product! Go Rubbermaid!"
"I needed some replacements containers for a set I purchased last year. However, buying the containers one or more at a time was expensive. This set costs waaaaaaaaaay less. So, now I have extras of the containers I didn't need. The reason I needed replacements is I have retired some containers when they got damaged by the microwave. They are great and I always have a bunch of them in the freezer. They hold up well in the freezer. After a year I still have most of the set left. I find the 1.25 cup size are used most. However, there aren't any sizes that don't get used often. I use the 0.5 cup containers to make salad dressings, the 1.25 and 2 cup containers to freeze make ahead dinners. The 7 cup container is great for making pasta salads. When I bought this set, I threw away all those mismatched margarine, whip topping and other containers. Now my cupboard is neat and organized."
Picture is deceiving. Biggest container is much smaller that it looks. Disappointing. I‚Äôll be returning these. Need big containers as well as small ones. This won‚Äôt do.
"I was looking for good storage containers with various sizes so I can use them for storing my homemade baby foods, yoghurt, left-overs and as a lunchbox for my husband. This ticked all the boxes for me and such good value too.  Here are things I like: -item arrived nicely boxed and stacked (See photo - no strong smell of plastic. -material feels sturdy and lids close and seal pretty well. I like the sound it makes when it seals. -the containers come in varying sizes - some reviews mentioned they are too small but for what i need, these are perfect. I stacked them up against a small enfamil can (12.5oz) and you can get an idea of the size.  -great for baby food storage - The smallest containers are perfect for storing baby food, i even made yoghurt in a few of them and turned out perfect this morning. I packed my husband‚Äôs lunch in one of the larger ones.  -Just note that only the 4 large lids are vented. I am okay with that. -great value - you get many containers in varying sizes at such a good price.  Overall, i am happy with my purchase. I highly recommend it!"
"I've been trying to find the perfect container for years and these are the best so far! They seal tight, stack, and wash up nicely."
"These food containers are awesome! The price was so affordable, the fridge is now better organized, and the quality is very good. I love the vented tops you can use to microwave food, and my favorite soups, quickly and easily. I find that there is less use for the mini containers, so I would've liked another couple larger ones instead. But overall, the material is very durable and they're totally leakproof! They keep food, especially fruit and veggies, fresher for longer.  My mom has trouble opening things with her hands but doesn't struggle with these. So these should be appropriate for most seniors with weaker grips. This is a great set with an excellent value, and I would highly recommend it!"
"Easy stack, fairly easy open, tight sealing, .. Things are good except it is not a microwave safe. And dont put hot food on it. The plastic melts in microwave or in contact with hot food. I did no run microwave like crazy long either. It was a minute long. It is not food stain."
"Bought these containers to replace our old Rubbermaid containers of the same size. I did see a few reviews showing melted containers but I needed new ones and I liked the look of the new lids.  The lids work well. and I do like them.  The containers hold up to cleaning on the top rack of the dishwasher but they do spot and look really ugly!  The worst thing is that the containers MELT IN THE MICROWAVE!!! So, don't put them in the microwave.  The picture is what our container looked like after my husband reheated some ground turkey that was in the fridge. I washed it in the dishwasher and this is the result.  TERRIBLE PRODUCT! SHAME ON RUBBERMAID!"
Order was to have contained four 3 cup containers with lids and four 5 cup containers with lids. Only received four 5 cup containers with lids. instructions say to contact Rubbermaid for missing or damaged parts. Called Rubbermaid and the process to receive the items I paid for but were not delivered is maddeningly time consuming and this was not my fault.
"I use rubbermaid storage containers almost exclusively. They are moderately priced, sturdy, seal well, and have only a few lid sizes for multiple volumes of storage. I do not however like the vented lids because I never reheat with plastic in the microwave, and it is too easy to accidentally open the vent due to placement. Also I prefer the standard red (or pink, purple, etc) solid color lids over the gray and clear tops. The gray do not snap onto the other lids which makes storage a little less convenient."
Nice to be able to just get these two sizes. The multi packs come with some many other sizes I already have so many of.
"I like rubbermaid, been using for many many years. These seem to become brittle after using in a dishwasher, BUT they do last. I started to hand wash these because the edges would snap off with weight inside after the dishwasher (might be the heated dry) and sitting in the cupboard for a couple days. The ones that no longer have the seal from the edges being brittle are being used for dog dishes (thats right, theyre not ready to be thrown out) but the rest of them work great for keeping food hot, or cold, for picnics or food delivering to family and friends. The vents, my favorite addition to rubbermaid, make for splatter-free microwaving like spaghetti or meats. So far they haven't stained like my older ones but with time that might change. They insulate well, keeping stuffing hot and deviled eggs cold on a 45 minute drive to a family dinner. When you snap them together, they become one so be careful as they might tip over. But that doesnt matter, nothing is going to spill unless theyre thrown out a window or dropped from a distance."
"i ordered 2 sets & they were received on time, accurate, complete and undamaged & i'm very happy! i got these to replace/update a clear & red lid set. #1 i love the brand, and #2 i really love this new gray color. (didn't get them for the anti microbial feature, but we'll see if it does anything.) they need to make larger containers & make the bigger bowls for sale separately so people can expand their collection. there are def too many tiny ones, but i knew that going in. i expect them to last and perform like my original set, but if they fail i will definitely update this review."
"I've loved these containers for years and years. Every so often they go on sale on Amazon and I buy another 20+ pack, as inevitably over time I'll have to toss one here and there as it was in the microwave too long and got permanently discolored or a lid would melt because my wife forgot to take the lid off before microwaving or simply because I brought food to a pot luck and knew I would never have my food container returned. Ever.  I was thoroughly happy to see the new vented lids. These, while it requires a few extra seconds of cleaning (and I often pop the vent part off and clean it separately just to be sure I got all the nooks and crannies), are tremendous for venting while reheating food in the microwave. I haven't seen a single melted lid yet, provided we remember to vent the cover before heating something up. It also makes melting butter in the microwave super easy and no more worry about going a few seconds too long and having a dish filled with butter explode all over the inside of your microwave. Instead, almost no butter gets out the vent hole, and keeps it contained if you decide to step away for just one moment too long.  Grab them when they're on sale, and you can thank me later!"
Nice sturdy containers and like the vented lid. Lids also interchangable with other sizes. I have several of these and they have lasted a few years and are like new.  One big problem I have had is not receiving what I ordered. I received four 5 Cup containers with lids. The product description said four 5 cup containers + four 3 cup containers with lids. It specified 8 pieces -- only got half the order. Working on fixing it with Amazon.....
"The Quality, Presentation, if your storing your food in these containers.. their leak proof & sturdy. there's a corner on the lids where you can lift to give you easy access to open. In the middle of the lid there is a piece that you can pop up to release some heat its Ventilation when done you just snap it back down. I choosed Red it's my theme in my kitchen & favorite color. dish washer safe store in the freezer microwave Rubber made is an excellent brand for keeping your food fresh its cleaning is easy and been around for years. Nicely packed it's a nice set. I'm very happy with my order."
"These are the same containers I always use, but to get them, WITH the vented lids, at essentially $2/each was a GREAT value! I was glad to pick them up when I saw the deal. I've used these containers for over 10 years now and really like the quality. The only failure I have with them is dropping them when frozen, of course they'll crack then. SO much better than using cheap quality storage that has to be replaced annually - I still have some that are from the original box I bought - 10 years ago. It's the way to go!"
"A few of the medium sized bowls have lids with vents. I use these to reheat in the microwave and they do an awesome job! No accidental messs in the microwave. All the bowl lids all snap firmly and have a corner tab to make it easier for my arthritic hands to open them, hot or cold. I also use them in the freezer. I let the bowl sit at least 5 minutes before removing the lid as the freezer seems to make the edges a little brittle. When I tried to open from a side and not the tab I have broken a chunck of the part that sticks out. The bowl and it's seal ability remain in tact when this happens. Tomato sauce over heated in the bowl will begin to ""melt"" the sides and leave a rough texture inside, but this doesn't cause trouble using the bowl again. I got rid of almost all my other bowls. I used to think Rubbermaid was expensive, but you get what you pay for here."
"We are always losing lids to our plastic containers or else they leak or are very hard to clean, especially oil based dressings. These containers are beyond perfect. Even with liquids, you can toss these around, throw them upside down and they won‚Äôt leak a bit. The lids are very secure and these are overall heavy duty containers. They are easy to clean and I‚Äôve had no issues throwing them in our dishwasher. Would definitely recommend. After all the years of having plastic containers that are hard to clean, lose their shape and leak, it‚Äôs better to spend a little extra money and buy a good brand. Long term it‚Äôll be worth it."
"I used to use this a long time ago and still have those pieces but they were large and I ended up giving many smaller pieces away with leftovers. After that I tried glass containers but most of them shipped and I was very careful when I loaded them in the dishwasher so I don‚Äôt know when that happened. So now I am back to these and I love them. The plastic is very sturdy and see-through I just stored tomato sauce in them without any residue smell or stain. They‚Äôre lightweight, compact the lids are easily storable/stackable, they don‚Äôt slip and slide they take very little room it all fits really well in my Tupperware drawer I‚Äôm delighted and this is a great price"
"We have used Rubbermaid containers for a long time and some were getting pretty scraped up and even melted from using in the microwave. I know, not a great idea but when you are hungry and the leftovers beckon....  In any case, these new containers are great. I really like that the lids of each size attach to each other so they can be stacked. Plus the new larger lids have a ""burp"" or vent feature that looks like a handy upgrade for freezer foods.  This gave me the opportunity to toss out many of the older containers and the old rubber lids that were hard to clean. A trip through the dishwasher and these were good to go. You won't be disappointed with these for sure."
"I'm in my 60s. I've been using plastic storage bowls since tupperware was a thing. These are without exception the best designed, most user-friendly, easy-to-use and clean storage containers we've owned. I will not ever buy another kind unless they stop making these. They stack perfectly in storage and in the fridge, the lids stick together but are easy to separate, the lids are stiff enough for use, but pliable enough to go on and off and be 'burped' easily--AND they recently improved the mid-size lids with airtight vents that can be easily removed for washing, etc. As for cleaning, of course they look used after a year or so, but they stay evenly clear, they clean very easily (dish soap and water, no hard scrubbing needed ever), and even tomato sauce doesn't stain them if not left in there for more than a few days. We microwave foods in them, but not things that might stain them, so I can't speak to what cooking tomato sauce or chili might do to them, but in every other way, I have found these to be excellent for kitchen, garage, and general storage use--even the small ones. BTW, a sharpie will mark the lids without problem."
"These containers stand up to our constant use. We use them for leftovers, school lunches and snacks, and even to house various worms and roaches we buy to feed our bearded dragon ( we leave the vent open for air). Also, and I have zero evidence to back this up, but I swear these vented tops are more flexible and nicer than non-vented tops. These containers keep looking brand new even after hundreds of washes in the dishwasher, acidic things like tomatoes, etc. Also my kids haven't destroyed one yet in their backpacks :)."
"I've used Rubbermaid for decades because of the durablility, dependability, and quality of their products. Also, I had the occasion to deal with their customer service. They were top notch, so I'm a fan forever. These food storage containers take a beating at my house. We use them for storage and microwaving. We take them to school and work. Even after washing them in the dishwasher, they still hold up well. They can stain if you microwave something like tomato sauce, though. It's not a deal breaker, though, as I'm happy with the product and the company."
"I was looking for the previous style that I had purchased, but could not find anymore. I wasn't sure if I wanted ""vented"", but bought them anyway. These Rubbermaid containers are the same great quality as my other good Rubbermaid ones. The venting is really an excellent feature! I put the lid on with the vent open, push down to get out excess air and then close the vent. The added suction helps the seal. When I go to open, I open vent first and then pull off the lid. The sizes are perfect. The lids are all the same size and snap together so you don't end up with missing lids and they neatly stay together. Very happy with this purchase!"
"These are great! The variety of sizes is excellent (though admittedly, I seldom have need for the smallest ones, it's still nice to know they're on hand). The lids form a tight seal that seems essentially leak-proof (though I still don't have the courage to put them in the fridge sideways) and the containers themselves seem sturdy and durable. I particularly like the vented lids for some of the sizes. Though these lids are not nearly as leak resistant as the others, I've found that feature great for microwaving."
"These have only leaked on me twice. Once when I filled the medium one with water and shook it, and once when I filled the big one with sugar and opened the vent so I could press the air out and sugar went flying. I feel like both of those are on me though. Very easy to clean. Doesn't stain. Durable, I have put one of these through the ringer and its still working great. The vents are great when you don't over fill them. I have a very easy time pouring straight out of these, the lip can cause dribble but it doesn't flow back to the container and spill everywhere like a coffee mug, so I like them. Top shelf in dishwasher and you're golden. 5/5 would recommend."
"I use these to store all kinds of food in the cupboard, refrigerator and freezer. My original set has lasted more than 10 years and it is finally beginning to look a little scratched -- from lots of hard use in my kitchen.  I have tried several other kinds of storage containers but none last as long or as versatile and indestructible. I even have a few in the basement and garage for organizing screws and other random small parts.  Right sizes for most anything from Costco size bags of sugar and oatmeal to spices and seasonings.  I always wash them in the dishwasher with no problem and unlike others I've used, they ... just ... don't ... break.  And finally ... they stack securely and because they're square, they take up less space than round containers."
"I love these . The lids for the three middle sizes are interchangeable, and snap to the bottom of the bowls. They stack inside each other making storage super convenient. All of these containers take up part of one shelf in my cupboard, where the previous set I had took three. I wash them in the top rack of my dishwasher and they come out nice and clean with no warping or pitting. You have to be careful in the microwave, however. I don't think the microwave itself is the problem, but if the food gets too hot, it can damage the plastic. The vents in some of the lids are a plus though."
I‚Äôm super impressed with the durability & how well the lid fits so snug on the container. The vent & the snug fitting lid is a must for anyone who hates cleaning the big mess in the microwave when the lid pops off after microwaving 1 sec longer then you should have. I bought this set quite a few months back & use them regularly. There‚Äôs still times when I overheat the food but because of the vent on the lid I don‚Äôt have to spend my time next to the microwave opening & closing the door to let the air out of the container to prevent the big mess I know I‚Äôm going to have to clean if the lid pops off. I‚Äôm really glad I bought this set & would recommend it to anyone that has a tendency of over nuking their food.
"Can't attest to durability or if they are leak proof over-time, but I can tell you that so far they do not leak and I guess time will tell of their durability. They do as advertised and are exactly what I needed and why I bought them. Good quality, good variety of sizes at a reasonable and fair price. They organize, store and hold all my ingredients (which I prep each Sunday night for the week) needed for my daily morning fruit and veg. smoothie. And that's why, in my opinion since this is my review, the 5 stars."
"We bought these to replace our Tupperware set we've had for years. These store better and have vented tops so you can microwave in them. The seals are a bit hard to push down, but I assume they will probably loosen up after being used for a while. An added bonus is that when you have food in them they stack nicely in the refrigerator, with the base of one fitting into the lid of the other."
"I really like these vented lid containers. They're great quality, can go through the dishwasher and don't stain as easily as others do. I love the vented lid, you can fill it with hot food and put the lid on and open the vent to let it cool down. They're great for the microwave because you can just open the vent instead of remove the cover. I wish you could buy them in individual sizes as opposed to packages with a mix of sizes and wish they were more affordable but definitely a great product."
"This set gave me plenty of storage for all the meals I cook for which I usually have leftovers. The containers have snap-on lids (with the larger ones have a venting feature on the lid). The lids and the containers are totally stackable. They can go in the freezer for long-term storage. With the n=venting feature on the larger containers, they can also be put into a microwave to rehear the contents. So far they have stood up to freezing, microwave reheating, and the hottest water for washing. They are also made from a plastic that does not leach undesired chemicals into the food nor does it get ""stained"" by the contents--not even spaghetti sauce! Highly recommended choice if you need more food storage."
"From the smallest container (which holds a whole lemon üçã minus the ends) to the largest this set impresses  I wanted something for lunches as well as for leftovers I ended up purchasing 2 sets The lids are thick the larger also having a couple that vent for reheating in the microwave They are freezer, dishwasher and microwave safe They seal tight with no leakage (tested in lunch bags and on construction sites lol) From yougart and dressings to steak and rice leftovers there is a size for it"
These are great containers to bring food to work in. The vent lid makes reheating really easily the only downside is the bowls stain easily. Doesn‚Äôt matter if its red sauces or a brown gravy it takes the color and its almost impossible to get the stain out. It does fade over time. That is why I gave it 3 stars. I have a set that didnt stain however after many years the lids became flimsy and needed to be replaced. I wish rubbermaid would go back to the older style bowls that didnt stain.
"This pack is great. We ended up purchasing it twice and then our friends got it too after seeing the containers in our kitchen, so the product markets itself very well. I like several features of it, but especially the fact that they stack together and hold one to another so they don't slip by accident when the stack is moved. The only downside is that they are not 100% leakproof. If I create a vacuum inside by pressing the lid down with the air cap open, then close the cap, I can hear how air is pulled inside because of the vacuum. This however is far from a deal breaker. I highly recommend this product."
"I ordered a set that of these that I really enjoyed. They didn't have the vent on them. I don't know how well the vent would keep in sauces or broths if sent in a lunch, covered dish, or picnic situation. But they were as close to a previous order I made that I could get. I think the vents would be great for cooking in a microwave where you had to let some of the pressure out of the container. So I'm sure that feature will be fine though I haven't used it yet. I've been able to use the solid plastic lids when needed. So I'm pretty happy with that. I couldn't answer as to whether or not the vents would leak, but I'm guessing that they might."
"I wish they had a set with just the larger sizes without overpricing them. I can order this 60 piece set for $25, but 7c singles are $5. It's really no big deal, but it seems strange that there isn't a set of these like 4 for $10 or something if they're giving me 60 containers for $25.  Anyway, as you can see, I have to split hairs to find anything wrong with these, so you know they're good to go.  Oh, and a word of caution: as these are EXTREMELY air tight, if you put coffee in them like I do with one of mine, then be sure to open the vent BEFORE closing the lid and then you can close the vent. Not doing that with a full container of coffee and trying to release the air after through the vent when the lid is on, will create a jet of coffee grounds all over your kitchen. Quite messy. Anyway, I'm glad they're air tight, as I store meat in some of them."
Bought these to replace an old set I got from my mother. I may have gone overboard.  Pros: Stack and nest great. Lids fit together and are interchangeable with different-sized containers. stacking filled containers with same-sized lids is nice because the bottoms lock into the tops. Even the tiny ones hold a surprising amount.  Con: Lids can be a little tight to close. Containers will stain with tomato sauce - perhaps they should be made tomato colored like the lids?
"My pet peeve used to be different size containers with different lids.  This set is high quality with thick plastic bases and lids. I think it reflects the high standards of Rubbermaid who generally makes good stuff.  And best of all, the bases and lids match are mostly interchangeable. For example, medium lids fit the various medium bases, large lids fit the various large bases, and same with the small sizes. The kit has a nice selection of small to large bases. Totally recommend."
My plastic container cabinet has always been a disaster! So many lids and containers of different sizes and shapes. I can never find the correct lid and it is just a mess. This is my second time ordering the Rubbermaid containers. I do not lose the lids and have no trouble finding a container now. You can microwave in these and they are also dishwasher safe. They are easy to clean and durable. They stack up to save space. I can finally rid my cupboard of all the clutter.
"I‚Äôve been a fan of Rubbermaid food storage containers for several years. They‚Äôre more rugged than the deli containers that often get reused, they stack efficiently for storage, and the container bottoms and lids snap together in way that makes it easy to stack them in the fridge of when traveling. I was a little concerned at reports of them melting in the microwave, but mine appear to be the same resin that they‚Äôve always used. The pop-up steam vent looks like a useful thing, but I generally don‚Äôt heat food in these containers."
"Happy with whole set. Have been using them for about a year now and they have stood up to everything. Had no leaks, even when I dropped a big one of warm soup! Very impressive. Like the way the lids hang together and everything makes a compact unit in my small kitchen's limited space."
"I bought a set over a decade ago and they lasted me great, most to this day. Some have been marked by high temp microwaving chili and stuff, but other than my abuse, which it defied heroically, they're still strong as day one. This set seems the same, except these lids have a vent cap thing. Love it, highly recommend it. Dont buy cheapies or generics."
"I know glass storage containers are probably ""better"" but these are relatively inexpensive, easy to find when I need more, and decent quality. I like having only one ""set"" of storage containers so that they all stack and I'm not searching for the right lid. I bought a similar set a few years ago and bought this to replace lost/broken pieces and just overall have more pieces."
"i tossed all of my plastic storage containers into the recycling bin. no more. these rubbermaid containers and lids, that all match up to one another, and fit perfectly, just made my life so much happier. that stress of pulling seven containers and fifteen lids, that aren‚Äôt friends, IS GONE. so easy. i bought a set for both of my kids, and i intend on gifting the heck out of this product. I LOVE THESE! little things mean a lot. do it..."
"I wanted Tupperware because I know they last forever, I remember my grandmother having whole sets that she had 25 years later and I wanted something that would last, the last couple sets I purchased did not make it 6 months. Anyhow, the pricing for Tupperware is way above my budget so I went looking for something comparable. I read many reviews and these looked to be the most promising. I am very happy with them, very sturdy and the sizes are perfect for me. I will likely by a second set. Rubbermaid products are just as good IMO and much less money. I will try and remember to update after a year of use."
I'm buying some new ones to replace two sets I purchased ten years ago. In ten years I've microwaved and frozen everything under the sun in these. They finally started to look sad after nuking too many foods with high grease or sugar because it eventually scars or stains them. I'll probably be back out here in another ten too.
"Rubbermaid has been around for many years. We have used some of the specific containers for so ling that they literally wore out. The only commercially available versions were in sets of 30 or 40 that we did not need. Thanks to Amazon, we were able to order the specific pieces at a fraction of the cost! Thanks, Rubbermaid, for making the best products, but thanks, Amazon by giving us access to just what we needed!"
"Initially, out of the box, these are great, leak-proof, highly durable, and top-shelf dishwasher safe for me. The drawbacks are that they do stain. I make a lot of pasta and the colored sauces and the stain from the sauces retain embedded within the materials. Cleans OK, but the stain remains. I use these for storage of food in the fridge and for my work lunches, so they get use a lot. With age, they do leak more and more and discolor, so I buy a set every year to replace the old ones. Microwave safe is a plus."
"Good re-up or starter pack. I don't use the vented lids, find it hard to clean. Watch what you are doing when using the microwave. Learn how to set the power level to reheat foods more evenly. Do NOT let greasy foods boil in the microwave. Do NOT heat tomatoe based products in these or the color seems to set and you get etching from boiling. If you find this hard, switch to glass storage containers. Soap, bleach, and water soaks get the color out. Dishwasher safe for us at least. It's nice to have a single style of food storage container. Keeps the cupboard organized."
"Great product, does its job. The microwaveable feature is a little overrated. I think it's better to remove the lid when microwaving food. The vent works best when I'm storing leftovers that are still warm, gets all the extra steam out so the water after its cooled doesn't sit in the food. Not all of the lids have the vent, obviously not the condiment size containers but also the large one. Still love and would still buy again!"
"These are nice quality plastic storage containers, but where they shine is the stacking and locking lids that have kept the same form factor over the years. I bought this set to replace some pieces from older sets and everything still stacks and locks. before this system my cabinet was a train wreck of random containers. These are the best for cabinet organization!"
These are fantastic and $20 is a good price for this set.  My only issue is some times the plastic seems to melt and I've thrown 2 away (2 out of several sets over the past 8 months).  We use these for school lunches that we prep at the beginning of the week.  Early appreciate not having to dig for lids all the time. I snap the containers together on the fridge when meal prepping too.
I‚Äôve used a lot of Tupperware and this brand never lets me down. They are leak proof. Very easy to clean. And the durability on them is amazing. This is the only brand I use. And what makes it better is I got everything and right amount of containers and lids as said in the description. These are definitely worth getting.
"I needed to replace some old, mismatched containers and these are great basics! Love how sturdy they are and the overall look of them. I choose the black set and like that they‚Äôre not the same old red I had before. However, next time I would opt for clear containers for practical purposes."
I've only had these about a week but my old ones needed replaced badly. These came neatly packaged. The larger ones have the great vents!!! My son goes to work carrying several with him for his lunches and they are very durable. He works in a factory. They don't leak his food and the machine smells/particlesof the shop don't get into his lunch. They fit nicely in the top rack of the dishwasher too. Great upgrade from my last rubbermaid set!
These are the best food storage around. The vented ports help with warming up your food in the microwave. Empty containers can be stacked on top of each other to minimize how much space they take. The price point is cheap.  I don't understand the negative reviews. Rubbermaid is better than anything else.
I much prefer this variety set over other rubbermaid sets I've gotten in the past. I cook a lot at home and typically need more large container options so it works great for me. While the xs sauce cups are convenient when you need them I have found I would do just fine if only 2 came in a set and instead had more large containers.
"The lids are super durable and thick, not the slim flimsy plastic like most.  The vent lids (4 of them, because some people are too illiterate to use the internet) work perfectly and exactly as advertised.  Ill clarify again, this comes with 4 vent lids. Thats all it is supposed to come with, all that is described, and all that is pictured. If you ordered it, got 4, and are mad you only got 4, you more than likely push a door labeled pull."
"Oh how I love these...got so sick of cracked Gladware lids...mismatched containers...aweful...now thanks to this awesome set, I reorganized everything and got rid of all but a few of my Gladware...These stack great and the lids are interchangeable, so you are not digging through lids to find the right one! Genius...Thank you...Christmas present to myself...I will now have more time to do the things I love!!"
"I use these for pre-cut ingredients for salads I eat each day for lunch. Separate containers for tomatoes, peppers, onions, etc. The seal valve, on top, allows you to close the top and then vent extra air to make a pretty tight seal. No pepper or onion smell leaks out. I'm pleased with both sizes."
"We absolutely love these! We originally bought the set with smaller sizes as well (which we still use), but this is the size we use the most, so bought some extras. These have the vents which are fine, but not a necessity for me."
"We absolutely love this set of ""tupperware"" type food storage containers! The fact that all the pieces stack together and all the lids snap together is genius - really great for small kitchens like mine. I also love how the container and lid are color-coordinated. It makes finding the right lid for the right size container a breeze. They're also just a cheerful color scheme that's fun to look at. A++ buy!"
"These containers stack perfectly. Love that, however they do leak sometimes. I am not 100% confident I can travel with liquid in these containers as they have leaked and made a mess several times."
"I love my Nest Lock Food storage containers. Finally, someone has found an inventive way to neatly store Tupperware. With the lids locked onto on another and the containers stacked ,it only takes up a minute piece of space. What I also appreciate with this container system is that they have a colored dot on the base so you can easily match it up to the correct colored lid. No more digging around in a drawer or cupboard to find the missing lid to a container. We have used them daily since we purchased them. No leakage at all. This is a great product.."
"I am so sad about these. I was initially delighted to find storage containers that nested like these, and the bright colors make it easy to find the correct lid. The haven't leaked with anything so far. And they have done fine in the dishwasher top rack. BUT, they are definitely NOT microwave-friendly! The first time my spouse heated a leftover in the microwave, the inside bottom on one end of the container partially melted inside, and now has a permanent, faintly orange-colored stain from the tomato-based sauce that was on the food he was reheating. That makes me wonder about how much of the material from the container ended up being part of his lunch that day... So, I guess we are keeping them, since they meet our other food storage needs, but won't be microwaving anything else in them. Would not purchase these again."
I buy Joseph Joseph products because of the quality and unique design. These are no exceptions. Work well and easy to store. My only complaint is that they are difficult to open out of the freezer. Otherwise exactly as pictured and detailed. Would buy again
"The lids are great. Snap on and leak proof. You can also add on to the set and the lids will all lock together when storing. Also, the set comes with great, usable sizes of containers"
"We were gifted the non-latching lid version of this set of storage containers. Loved the color coding for lids with bases and the ability to always have the right size container with the variety here. While that was a good product with some pluses we did NOT like the lids - this set solves the lid problem with the latches while keeping the pros of the previous versions. The lids won't pop off, nor do they have trouble closing with the seals catching on corners. Can't tell you how happy we were to find and purchase these and toss our previous Joseph Joseph ones. Good fix"
"I buy alot on Amazon. I got new bins in my kitchen and getting organized. I came across this container nest. Never had a nest of plastic containers before. Alot of cheap dollar store containers were strewn around in my cupboards including lost 'lids'. I was annoyed..lol. I threw out most of old containers and saw this; tried it and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. the lids 'nest' in a square hole and fit perfectly . Love the snap sides. Cleans great in dishwasher. All color coded to each size. Keeps all in ONE PLACE in my bin. When one container is in use, the others just still snap into place. Great engineering whoever did this. I got other labeled plastic containers too, different brand, works great; for flour, sugar. so My kitchen is just grand now ; ORGANIZED and not a jumbled mess. MEASURE your shelves /cupboards before buying anything to organize your kitchen stuff."

"These food storage containers lock in flavors and food juices, no leaks when accidentally tipped and they‚Äôre a softer plastic so they don‚Äôt crack if you drop them on the floor. The lids are dishwasher safe which is helpful because I get tired of seeing lids in my sink that need to be hand washed. Plus each container has a different color trim on the lid that matches the same color dot on the bottom of the right container and the whole set locks together with the lids on. I‚Äôm going to order another set to replace my Lock and Lock containers."
"I purchase Joseph Joseph products initially because of aesthetics, but all of this brand‚Äôs products are well constructed and function as advertised. I really like the compact design of these containers."
"I love the Joseph Joseph nesting food storage. I bought two sets. I use these everyday for my lunch boxes. I haul a large salad, chicken and fruit in separate containers and two thermos in a backpack to work and they have never leaked. Much lighter and safer than hauling glass. Love the top is color coded to the container. Stains like sauce clean right out just fill with soapy water and toss in a shot of bleach and wait 10 minutes. Come right back to new!"
Great storage boxes for leftovers. Much easier than plastic wrap. My problem was the nesting. The picture is misleading. It gives the impression the containers nest and that the lids nest. THE. FACT IS: The containers nest with lids on. I never tried this because I looked at the picture. I upgrade to 5 stars.
These are perfect for ice coolers and keeping your food from getting wet. I like that it's plastic so it won't break when freezing or be too heavy for travel. I often meal prep for camping and freeze them in the containers too. Helps with keeping things at temp and purchasing less ice so it's nice to have the plastic option.
"Had the original version without the latches, and we loved them for their organization. But.... the lids never sealed on the bin correctly, so we had to toss as they let in oxygen easily. Then I saw they came out with this version that includes latches so I purchased these. A few weeks in everything was great, problem seemed to be solved now that they latch on tightly. Then.... the largest container seemed to stretch lengthwise and only way to close the latches of the lid was to squeeze the container at the same time, which usually resulted in only latching 3/4 sides, so frustrating."
Additional feature I really like is that they are easier to clean than any plastic container I've ever used. It's usually very hard to get a squeaky clean container that held any kind of oil based food. I've re-washed others sometimes more than once and they still felt slippery and I'd end up tossing them out of frustration. These containers save me time.
"These work well for me to remove paint from model cars. They lock tightly. Overall they work well, they nestle with each other okay, when you remove one it messes with the order. I'm only using one of the boxes at the moment I may be using others at a later date to store food in."
I have a lazy susan full of containers and lids that never seem to match up. They are like socks and the dryer -- one part of the set seems to disappear every time I reach in. Costco seems to delight in offering different types of discounted storage sets and the lids never interchange. I will not lie -- I take way too much pleasure in the fact that they stack within each other.
I car camp so space is very limited. I have bought other container sets that are great at holding what ever I put inside them but take alot of space when empty. Each of the containers in this set can fit nicely with in the bigger containers in the set. Helps me keep my car camping set up organized and my food fresh. Loving it.
"I love the organization that the Joseph Joseph nest lock containers afford. No more looking for lids and they look great in the cabinet, too. Two people in our home, we own two sets, but I think we could do with a third. So far (8 months) they have resisted stains, held up to the freezer and dishwasher, and they have stayed completely intact. I highly recommend them..,they are worth every penny."
"We're very pleased with this nesting set of containers. The designers/engineers did a great job fitting them together. The do seem to provide an airtight closure. The lids are color-coded to a matching dot on the containers, making it easy to quickly grab the top you need, without having to think about it. The packaging itself? Thanks to whoever decided to package this without using obnoxiously difficult to remove sticky labels. That's appreciated more than they will know. You can't go wrong with any of these sets. We highly recommend them."
"I was skeptical of these when I read about them in an article but am so happy I bought these. I don‚Äôt eat three meals a day so prior to this, my food would would go bad quickly if I didn‚Äôt eat it in time. I started putting all produce in these containers in the fridge and it‚Äôs extended the lifespan of my produce by at least 2 weeks. I‚Äôm truly amazed. I plan on buying more. They‚Äôre great."
"Produce is as described. Could use a few more smaller containers as part of the 'set'. The larger ones are less often used in my house. Small one got spaghetti sauce stains after one use, spaghetti was in for two days, then ran it through the dishwasher, and came out stained red from the sauce. Sigh, it's hard to find plasticware that won't stain by tomato sauces.  Overall quality product, but no better or worse than competitors."
I LOVE these containers. The lids and bottoms stack well and fit in my drawer. They really are water tight. I've used them in the microwave and dishwasher. One snap closure came off and I thought it was broken. I contacted the company and the responded quickly. Then a friend was able to snap it back on. Not broken!
"Nice set of food storage containers. I love how they stack together and the color coding adds a stress free organization feature. My Husband opened the box and rolled his eyes ""tupperware ? "". Yet he thought the cleaver design was brilliant. Gone are the miss matched old stuff . Now I feel all organized."
"I bit the bullet and got rid of all my stray containers and bought 2 Joesph Joesph sets. So easy to organize! love the color coordinated tops and bottoms. They make the refrigerator, and cupboard look so much better. Just one small thing made such a difference. I never scramble to find the matching tops and bottoms. So worth it!"
"No, I am not a salesperson for any kind of plastic food storage containers. I have a woman who cooks for me sometimes and she brought a set over for me to look at. I mentioned them to the ladies I play cards with and most of them already used them and love them. Now I am the newest convert!"
"I purchased this set a couple of months ago. They are a great space-saving set, offer sizes that I use often and are easy to clean. No leaks to this point. Will be great on our sailboat next summer!"
Love these containers. Easy to clean and they don‚Äôt stain. I thought tomato sauce would stain. I rinsed them in cold water then put in dishwasher and no stains! They lock easily too. Very happy with this product.
We bought both the normal ans flaps version. The normal ones are one&star and we can't seal them. These ones are perfect and will be the ones we grow the set.the other one is now Lego bricks storage.
"Not only are these assorted sizes perfect for a variety of uses, but the color-coded dot in the bottom of each container matches with the lid so there‚Äôs no guesswork. I just love these."
Lids stack and lock into each other well. Lids lock securely onto containers. I wish some of the containers were bigger sized but overall a good set.
"These containers have nesting lids, which is a very nice feature! I find ""Joseph Joseph"" products are very impressive in function and looks great! I can't wait to organize my cabinets. I purchased 2 sets! Would advise anyone to purchase these nice containers."
This product is 100% worth the money. They nest easily and fit great into a cabinet that was previously overflowing. Their variety of sizes works perfectly for my Tupperware needs. A plus.
"Inner plastic is used, like a cellphone face cover. Remove it before you use it. Got a nasty surprise when I couldn't figure out why a decay smell was coming from my Tupperware. After removal of film and a good disinfectant wash- it was like brand new."
These containers are well made. I am getting rid of all the dollar store containers. I like the color coordinated containers and they are consolidated easy use. No longer will the containers be falling out of the cupboards when I open them.
"I have a small kitchen so it nice to have quality, leak proof, and microwave/dishwasher/freezer safe containers. They are a good size, easy to clean and compact"
Great quality and engineered design. The design was very well thought out. The lids all snap together and the entire set all fits in the large container. The lids fit tight and are perfect for leftovers. Awesome space saver. We bought a set of another brand from QVC that weren't stackable and they took up the space of an entire cabinet. They went to a donation center. Thank you Joseph Joseph.
"I like the idea of stackable. It is leak proof easy to clean and doesn't leave red sauce on the container. Fits in my cabinet all together, takes up less room. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Love the compact style of these, I make home made dog food and these containers with their color coatimg and stackable sizes let me know whats what at a glance. Will buy again."
This was my first time buying this brand. They are fantastic and the only brand I will buy from now on. They are airtight. no way can they spill unless you don't put the lid on correctly. They are color coded so you know which lid goes with each container and the lids nest together. Very convenient. Great Storage. Very impressed!
Perfect for solving my problem of having all of the tops tumble out whenever I opened the cabinet door. Tops and bottoms fit together perfectly inside the largest container clipped down so they don't come loose. Tops and bottoms are color coded according to the band color on the lids and a small dot on the individual containers. Doesn't take up much self space. Very pleased with this product.
They come in great Color‚Äôs and sizes  I‚Äôve tossed all my old and may purchase another set of this set
I have bought these a couple of times - will never go back to the old ones. The quality of this brand name makes the difference. They are very sturdy.
"Love this going to buy another set, we used them for camping, kept them in cooler that was filled with ice. Even hubby liked them how easy they where to Close. And they‚Äôre nice and compact when you don‚Äôt use them"
"I don‚Äôt know what I love more, the leakproof lid, the variety of sizes and the fact that they are stackable. I know the matching color codes on the dish and lid are also awesome. Very happy to have made this purchase."
"These things are the best! I through away all my other containers. Buying two more sets now. I hate trying to find the correct lid, hate trying to fit them in the cabinet, hate everything about all other containers. These, on the other hand, a dream come true. Oh, and they don't stain!"
"These work for airtight storage. I like the color coding. Ones without the side snaps did not work, so ordered these. Satisfaction."
"Joseph Joseph is a quality name I knew I could count on so there was no hesitation on buying these. They They are heavier than I expected, but the seal upon locking is air-tight. I also like the nesting capability for storage. Overall, I am quite pleased."
"Tiny dots on the bottom of each container indicate the color of the lid that goes with it. The nesting function is really convenient. This was a great deal, and I'm glad I got it."
These were totally worth the money to get and throw everything Tupperware (or likewise) away. They hold seals well but they lack a few larger sizes. No real complaints since i could have bought a different type for larger ones to be included.
No more having to rummage through and search for matching tops and containers in the cabinet! These are great space savers and do the job of keeping the food in the containers without leaking. Going to buy another set!
These are very well made containers that nest completely inside one another with their lids attached. Gives you a lot of storage without taking up hardly any room. Living on a boat this is very important.
Easy to use. Easy to find the right top since each size are diffrent color
These containers stack perfectly and are made of sturdy plastic. The lid seals air tight as long as it is aligned correctly and the gasket is clean/free of debris. I have used these with hot and cold products for several months without any issues.
Love the way they fit inside each other and lids color coded. BOught set in store and loved so much I bought another on amazon. Work great and store perfectly. Not sure about durability or leak proof yet but great storage and accessibility.
These are great! I‚Äôve used them in the fridge and freezer. My peppers lasted 3 weeks and still going strong. Sorry no pics; however well worth the money üëçüèæ
"We‚Äôve had these about 2 months and love that the stack and snap together, which is great for storage. The sealant is great and great storage. The lids are color coordinated with it‚Äôs appropriate tupperware. Will buy again, when I need."
"These nest well, color coated, keep food fresh & was up in dishwasher very well."
"Great set, I liked it so much I ordered a second! Finally got to throw out all of my miss matching containers and lids, I love how they are color coded on the container and the lid so you can find them easily in a pinch! Also stack nicely."
Lice the nesting but the locking lid even more. Keeps everything neat and tidy!
I love the color coding of the dots on the underneath to let you know the color lid (in case you couldn‚Äôt figure it out) and the containers are DEFINITELY leak-proof!!
Bought a small container at Barnes and Noble. We liked it.
The colored lids make all the difference in the world. Other containers have boring blue or red lids. These look so cute in my fridge. They lock all the way around too!
Loved them so much I bought them twice!!
doesn't take up a lot of space because it locks into each other
"I would buy more of these if I needed them, great containers, easy to store containers and lids in one small space. Love them!"
"Saves lots of space and my drawer is no longer a mess. Nice, practical purchase"
"These are durable, leak proof and easy to clean. No more lost lids in the cabinet. Will recommend to everyone!"
These containers are so much better than the brand name lock n lock. Easier to stack-store in a smaller area better. We use the containers to store our big batches of soup we cook up.
These worked perfectly to organize packaged food I order on the regular. There are a lot of complaints about the lids not staying closed. A tip: The flaps are very stiff and will want to straighten (pop open) when new. Bend them back and forth a bit to loosen them up. Once I did this I had no issues at all. Perfect dimensions for storing Optavia packets and protein bars!
"The containers are larger than I expected, but fit perfectly. I turned the shelves above the laundry into a pantry. The order came with easy to use vinyl like labels, and you get more than enough extras. Along with a white marker. I cleaned out the pantry, put everything into containerd. Now before I shop I can easily check what's needed, and not over shop at the store."
These are great and I love the horizontal storage they provide. The plastic is like the plastic in a Rubbermaid container but more durable. In the advertisement it looks like crystal-clear hard plastic to me. They were a bit bigger than I expected but fit nicely when I turned them side by side in my pantry (see pictures). The lid flaps were very stiff but after bending them back and forth a bit they are sealing just fine. The seal seems to be airtight. I am very happy with my purchase!
"I purchased these for all my ""long"" pastas. I purchased Vtopmart Airtight Food Storage Containers 6 Pieces - Plastic PBA Free Kitchen Pantry Storage Containers for Sugar,Flour and Baking Supplies - Dishwasher Safe - 24 LabelsVtopmart Airtight Food Storage Containers 6 Pieces - Plastic PBA Free Kitchen Pantry Storage Containers for Sugar,Flour and Baking Supplies - Dishwasher Safe this set previously and they are all they say they are!! I recommend these to any one who is looking for some great storage containers."
"These storage containers are a nice rigid, mouse proof plastic. The lids have a gasket so that it seals and is air tight, have not tested but with the gaskets should also be water tight. The lids clip on all sides so there is no running the finger around trying to push the last corner in place. They stack very well. Love them."
"Baking at Christmas we always have different cookies and now I have good storage! I‚Äôm working on organizing (cookies on plates with tin foil wasn‚Äôt working!). Great for stacking, kids could see before choosing."
They also come with labels and a marker
"If you‚Äôre looking for containers to hold spaghetti and not take up much space look no further! These are perfect size, we stored several different types of pasta, one for rice (held the whole box) one for spaghetti (surprisingly held 7 boxes) one linguine noodles, one sorted mini bow tie, elbow and a few others (again, so much space). They all stack and take up minimal space.  Dislike- they do leak air in no matter how many time we try"
""
"Bought these for my daughter to store the animal snacks in as the crazy cats would chew through the treat bags the treats came in. I went to check her pets, and the cats had knocked all three containers onto the floor. Very sturdy, indeed!"
I was looking for something to stack neatly and contain some pantry items. This is exactly what I‚Äôd hoped for and came with labels and 2 scoops! Recommend and I would buy again.
I was surprised how much I liked these containers. They were perfect for holding pasta. Most pasta containers are too tall to fit our low clearance cabinets. I ordered a second set to store cookies or chips in. They would also fit nicely into drawers
I love these containers as you can visually see what is in each one. These hold quite a bit of pasta and easily stack on top of each other.
"I have tried three different storage containers this week from three different companies. This is my least favorite but I needed something shorter and longer, not tall so this fit that bill. I had trouble getting the lid to close. One side always wanted to pop open. Kept it because it was size I needed. Time will tell how it goes."
Great sturdy product. One of these will easily hold 3 pks of spaghetti noodles or one large bag of egg noodles.
"I use one for spaghetti, its much easier to get the right portion than dumping from a vertical container"
"I bought dozens of these in a variety of sizes. Now my pantry is organized and beautiful. The quality is great, they seal properly and feel durable enough to last for many years."
Great container bought them to replace Rubbermaid old products that weren't available any more. Completely satisfied with this purchase.
These fit all of my noodles and I love how they look stacked up! Very happy with my purchase!
I love these containers. I've ordered 3 multi packs of various sizes for all my pantry items storage. They'll last forever and do the job they were purchased for. Very happy with them.
just got them and will update review. very impressed that this container was able to hold 8 packages of spaghetti. exactly what i needed
"These are so sturdy, and airtight! I have ordered several kits. Some of them take a second to get the lid down before connecting, but only the first time you put it on, I absolutely love these!"
These airtight containers are a MUST! They also come with measuring cups! Super sturdy and totally airtight. I've already ordered a second set.
It works great my only concern is that the top must be lined up perfectly for the top to snap close correctly.
I‚Äôve been organizing my pantry. I use these for all my pasta. They are perfect easy to get into and store. I‚Äôm sure I will be ordering more.
These containers are great to hold the dog food I make. I can stack them in my freezer nicely.
"Although one lid was delivered broken, the remaining lids were super strong. Thick plastic but see-through."
"Used for organizing my dry soup packages, packaged hot chocolate, jello, pudding and other dry foods. in the pantry. The dimensions of the containers are exactly what I needed."
"Great for storing all types of pastas, oats, beans...."
This item is working for us. We are glad we bought them.
I use them to hold my long pasta or leftovers
They are great for my lasagna sprgheand other long noodles. Plus hok quite a few boxes of pasta. They stack nice also
It seems to be leakproof though I am using it to protect spices. I like the shape for neat appearance and efficient storage.
"Stackable, airtight containers. Love them"
The containers are well made and met my need for food storage
Perfect for space and organization.
Love them! Makes organizing things so easy! The airtight storage keeps things as fresh as the day you bought them. I love how they stack and that all containers have one size lid.
"They are sturdy, stackable & sealed. Perfect for sugar, grits, pasta, cookies. Highly recommended."
Works perfect for storage. Recently made slushy‚Äôs and stored with no problem. Proper price.
"Use for spaghetti so can lay on its side, not up."
"I have a small pantry and love to use containers so to ulitize space these work great, will be ordering another set"
"Perfect! Plenty roomy, thick plastic, see through, secure lid."
Well worth the money to keep everything organized
Love them! Super large. Could probably fit about 2-4 boxes of pasta in one container.
We bought these to go with the taller containers we bought and it‚Äôs been great.
Perfect for my pasta in my pantry
I love the quality of these and the added measuring scoop is a perfect addition. I love to bake so these came in handy for all my baking storage needs
Thought it was going to be more air tight but for the price its good
Love these storage container .. they fit prefect and are easy to use .
Had to try a little harder than I should have to to get the lids on but was otherwise good!
We purchased several for our pantry! They are holding up well!
These are perfect for storing Costco size pasta. I can see how much I have and label can be easily erased - perfect for me!
Great space saver and organizer.
super sturdy
Thin material doesn't snap shut very well.
Love them
"These are the perfect size, comes with 2 little scoops which are amazing, the sticker labels are great, I like that there are slightly different shapes and sizes. The pen writes really well. Will definitely be buying more soon."
"great to use for all kinds of storage , perfect sizes and great fit."
"Works great, keeps food fresh and comes with a little measuring scoop."
Way easy to use and look good. Will be getting more.
Containers came in an unmarked box with a label sitting on them. The containers are nice and stacked on inside the other. I filled them with water to see if they leaked and nothing all containers stayed with the liquid inside. The only concern I have is the rubber band that seals them they may get smell in the long run. I suggest cleaning them immediately after using. They are dishwasher safe microwave safe. So great.
"these are amazing containers. I have bored people to tears by talking about them with co-workers, friends, and family. They really work, and the locking mechanisms are super strong, and honestly, kind of hard to shut and lock at times. I also love the various sizes they came in. So, my only caveat is that if you have arthritis in your hands, you might not want to get these. That being said, the locking mechanism gets easier to open and shut with more use."
"So, I am a meal prep kind of a guy and go through a lot of dollar tree containers; as you can imagine, they‚Äôre pretty frail and cannot often be kept for too long without some damage. The containers are so well crafted and useful; the ultimate test for me is storing liquid on my bag, I‚Äôm always wayyy to concerned that there will be a nasty leak, these are not like that at all! I love them and also have used other sizes to store kitchen things as well. All around perfect product!"
"These containers are everything everyone else says except picture of the sizes is very deceiving. Even after I read the oz. they hold, I still felt the larger ones would be enough to put a decent amount of prepped food in. Read carefully the reviews that talk about what each one will hold before making your decision. If you don't mind the smaller sizes of containers, then these are actually amazing. They lock very easily to keep anything from leaking, to keep food from spoiling. They clean in the dishwasher wonderfully & don't melt the way the throwaways (or even Tupperware) do. These will definitely stand up to a beating and keep on ticking!"
"They were sent packed in the brown Amazon box and not a company box. The size of the containers are deceptive. If you are looking, like I was, for containers that will hold more than 5 cups, these are smaller. I do understand that the pictures are digital to enhance visuals but they are small the largest container being 4.2 cups. They seem durable but wanted to inform new buyers that they are smaller than advertised. I like the way they are made, however I now have to buy more larger then these. Although they are smaller than anticipated, I may buy another just to have enough storage."
"These containers are really nice - thick smooth plastic and a very tight seal on the locking lids. Some of them are super small though and I am currently unsure of what to do with those, but I'll find something and that didn't seem like a good reason to lower my rating. I'm very happy with these! Freezer, dishwasher (even on the bottom rack I haven't had any issues). I haven't personally tried popping them in the microwave because putting any plastic food container in a microwave makes me wig out a bit, but these things take everything else really well."
"I make dinners for my boyfriend. I had previously purchased a different brand of containers and was so disappointed from the lids coming off, cracking of the plastic and the worse thing was the way that the previous meal left an odor. BUT these containers are absolutely phenomenal. No leaking whatsoever (I have no idea what my boyfriend does with his lunch bag but when I get it back the following night things are chaotically toppled), the lids are easy to put on and off (some lids from other products are hard to unsnap‚Ä¶ not these), and my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE‚Ä¶ no residual smell after washing in the dishwasher!!!! They also stack a lot nicer than my original Rubbermaid ones‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm definitely ordering more of these!!!  The only thing I wished was that there was a slightly larger tiny container for salad dressings."
"This airtight food storage container set is an incredible buy. I love it! It is airtight to keep things fresh inside. The lids snap into place with ease, no problems.  I‚Äôve recently gone through my entire kitchen and between this and a few other sets of various sizes, I have moved nearly all I have into airtight containers. That includes things in the refrigerator, too. Vegetables get cleaned and put into containers in the fridge. It was hard to keep shelves and cupboards clean with kids in the house, but with these there is almost no mess to be made. It is easier to find things, too. The clean shelves give me peace of mind. Also, these are clear so it is obvious when I am running low on something - and much easier to make a grocery list.  The sizes in this particular container set are really useful and I would definitely buy it again if I have need for more. It was a good value."
"I took FOREVER, to settle on storage containers to replace the ones I currently have. Finally settled on this one, and what a DISAPPOINTMENT!! Microwaved my turkey chili and the bowl (I'm not sure how to describe).. didn't' quite melt, but got deformed after microwaving. Not to mention...they STAIN! Wish I could send back!"
"Warning! These are tiny containers, way too small to be practical, but that's my fault for not paying attention to the sizes, so that's not why I'm rating these low. My issue is that the lids do not stack well, so they're not easy to store, and one of my lids arrived broken. The containers don't nest together, again, making them difficult to store when not in use. Also, one of the larger containers cracked after a couple of months. AND they are NOT freezer friendly. I'm very disappointed in these and I wish I would have chosen a different set."
"These are by far the BEST food storage containers I've ever had. I recently started a new diet plan to include meal prep and the different sizes in this pack are perfect for what I need. I also love the lockable lid feature and the fact that they are leak proof! Not many container manufacturers can claim true leak proof, but these definitely are! I typically put the little dressing containers in a baggie before putting in my lunch bag just in case, but there's really no need because they've NEVER spilled! The only downfall is that even though the containers are suitable for the (top rack) of the dishwasher and don't seem to break down over time (I've been putting them in the dishwasher since I bought them in April) the lids should be washed by hand. I found the first one I put in the dishwasher (top rack) the lid did not fit properly whereas I had to put my whole weight just to get it click back onto the container. I believe this is due to the high water temp in the dishwasher making the gasket inside the lid swell and eventually if these are continuously washed this way, they'll just break down and not be leak proof anymore. I have no issues with the lids once I found out that one flaw. But regardless, I'm still giving them 5 stars because I love them! Also, with the lids lockable there is less chance they will get lost. I've never had containers this long with all matching lids ready to go when I need them!"
"This set is super affordable, with a great range of sizes and shapes. The plastic is very durable and the lids are perfectly leak proof. I'm so glad I purchased this set over the others I was looking at, since it's cheaper than some other brand name sets I was looking at and comparable in quality. The only criticism I can really give is that I wish two of the teensy tiny dressing/condiment containers were a little bit bigger for stuff like peanut butter or seeds, for example, since these ones are just big enough for dressing for a salad. But I actually really love having some as tiny as they are to put medication or earrings/rings in when traveling."
"They are great. Keeps things fresh and easy to clean and store. My only issue is I can't close the lid on most of them. That's not a bad thing if your strong in the hands. My hubby has to put the left overs away because I can't close the lids. But this insures they stay fresh and won't leak and it's a good reason for me to not have to put the food away :) However, I'm out of luck if he's away. Then I'll have to use the old yucky ones. Great product, hope they start making these in bigger containers."
"I purchased these last July. Used them for left overs for holidays, cocktail parties, etc. I live in a condo building and send food to my elder neighbors. So easy for them as they are microwavable. Sizes are perfect and the snap lids are much easier than other food storage containers.  I will be purchasing more as some of my guest or neighbors forget to return - no biggie! The price is right!"
"I popped these puppies in the dishwasher straight out of the box and they survived the hot tundra flawlessly. Haven't yet had a chance to put them to use at the current time of writing this review, but so far I'm a happy camper. I have a large empty drawer that I toss food storage containers in, but I could see that the inability to properly/fully stack everything could pose an issue for some. Don't get me wrong, these things fit into each other and then 'Russian doll' themselves nicely together, but they don't have lids that snap onto the bases of each containers, or lids that snap together, etc.  I also was kinda bummed that the lids aren't rated as microwave safe (the rubber gasket is the culprit here..), but that is typical for all products of this variety, unless you opt for those without the rubber, which then sort of defeats the purpose of an airtight food saving container.  Would recommend."
"Can't speak for durability or leak proof yet, as I just got them and loaded them into the dishwasher. But I'm pretty impressed with the quality so far. Based on what I've seen and felt, they should hold up really well! I'm pretty excited to start using them. I love the variety of sizes they come in. And I especially love that they are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. Not even top rack dishwasher safe - anywhere works. So far they appear to be an extremely good deal. I'll update if they fail to meet my expectations as I use them."
"These storage containers are a great buy! They‚Äôre very easy to snap into place and I have never experienced any leaking. The different sizes are really helpful, especially for leftovers -there‚Äôs even small containers that can be used for sauces and condiments. I also use to pack up snacks and lunches for the beach. They‚Äôre very easy to clean as well -just throw them in the dishwasher and they are easy to store as the various sizes fit well into one another."
"Wife loved these to replace the hodge podge of various containers collected over the years. Uniform and stackable. These are well made, have great locking seals and this set provides sizes from tiny to large. Even has locking cups for condiments such as mustard or ketchup. You could easily fit Thanksgiving leftovers in this set and eat for a week. Dishwasher safe but you will have to remove the seals........they do not leak.....if you want to keep them that way, follow the directions."
"this is my 3rd set-I love them...no, they're not very big, but they are perfect for leftovers at my house. this is my 3rd set because I believe in giving food to people and telling them to use the container to give food to someone else. hopefully they do....but they are great and I will keep buying them when I run low. of my previous 2 sets, one tab off of a top did break off...not sure how that happened, but I've had them for a long time, and stuff happens."
"I used to buy the cheaper red top Tupperware. It didn't take long for them to stain, or even have the lids break. This set of food containers not only look nice, but seem to fit better in my lunch box. It's not recommended to microwave with the lids on, as the seal might get damaged. That's not a deal breaker though, the same can be said with even the most expensive containers.  With the amount included in this set, I can easily prepare my breakfast and lunch for the work week and still have a couple containers to spare. Even putting in acidic foods (like tomato sauce or hot sauce), doesn't seem to make them stain. These are stylish, and a major upgrade with only a few dollars more for the quality of product. I don't think anyone could go wrong with these."
We have had these for about 9 months now. My husband loves them so much that he wants to get rid of the other major brand and had me order a 2nd set. They are perfect for adult lunches. I found that using dawn powerwash and a magic eraser gets any potential stains out. They resist stains better then the other brands.  Repeat custome and will recommend
"These are great food storage containers, they do not leak, and are very easy to clean. They stack up nicely in the cupboard with lids that are easy to match with the container. I have arthritis in my hands and find that these lids that lock are easier to open and close."
These are the best well made and strong containers I have ever purchased. The lids sometimes are a little difficult to use but they will snap on securely and tightly....making them leak proof. The containers them selves do stack but then there is the problems of the lids. I try to place them under the right containers they fit but this seems to just get messy at times. They wash well in the dishwasher...containers and lids. Liked them so much that I bought a second set.
"I just got my order of Full Star Food Storage Containers with Lids, therefore I can‚Äôt rate based on use. The set looks very nice, and feels very durable. The lid locks on very tightly, so I‚Äôm hoping that means no leaks. They stack nicely as well. I will update after some use of the product."
"Ok I needed new Tupperware but I didn‚Äôt want my Tupperware to keep getting kidnapped, running away and leaving me. It‚Äôs really starting to give me a complexü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So I bought this stuff (had it 4 months) hasn‚Äôt left, fingers crossedü§™ but it does keep the salad crisp, doesn‚Äôt explode if dropped, and spaghetti hasn‚Äôt stained it. Our relationship is off to a good start."
"I really like these containers, they have many sizes which really helps with leftovers. My only critique would be that the small round containers which are perfect for salad dressings would be great to be purchased separately;They are also a great snack containers too."
"I've been using these to pack my lunches for a little over a month now. I've packed everything in them from sandwiches and vegies, to salads and even soups! I ride my bike to work, so they get jostled a bit in my backpack as I ride. They've never spilled, or even leaked a drop! The seal is solid, and the clasps always hold fast! These are definitely some of the best food storage containers I've ever owned!"
my husband is handicap and only has use of his right side these food storage containers are easy for him to open and seal closed by himself with out leaking they do stain because they are clear plastic or what ever they are made from when he stores spaghetti-O's in them but yeah that stuff Stains Everything. I am very happy with my purchase.
This storage set arrived promptly and seems to be well made. The snap type lids are easy to use. I am unsure if I will use some of the very small (tiny) containers. My husband finds these lids easier to use with his arthritis. As I have only had these for less than 2 weeks I cannot accurately rate the durability. However they do seem to be made well.
Maybe the pic will help give u an idea of the different sizes...not as big as I thought but I love them anyhow and is exactly what I needed.
"I love these containers, but I replace them every year as they start to absorb the orders of food. Even then, they are very good and I‚Äôm comfortable using them in my husbands lunch bag as I know they way he throws his bag around, they don‚Äôt spill! And the cost of the containers makes the replacement easy and won‚Äôt break the bank!"
This is my second order with this company. First order there was a minor issue and they were very responsive. It is nice to know there are companies that go above and beyond with Customer Service. A card is in closed inside the box to call or email for support if there should be a problem and they are very responsive.
"No leaks, and i can just throw them in the dishwasher for painless cleaning, though washing by hand isn't too bad either, even with oily foods or tomatoes.  The range of sizes is pretty good. I find i can fit 3-4 baked chicken breasts in the largest ones, and meals for lunch will comfortably fit inside the next largest containers, and even the square containers can fit a meal, though only enough for 4 ounces of meat and 4 ounces of vegetables. You'd be hard pressed to fit any rice in there too. Pretty good product."
"Buying containers like this online is always a crapshoot because you never really know what you are getting. These containers are amazing and well worth the money. They seal up and lock down firmly, creating a leakproof seal on the food, soup or whatever you are trying to contain. They hold up nicely in the dish washer as well."
"Very pleased. Does not leave stains. Easy nesting storage. Love the locking covers. Not recommended for microwave cooking, however, I just set my microwave to a lower power level and it works great. I replaced all my old containers and will be purchasing another set of these with additional sizes. Stacks really good in the refrig/cupboards."
Excellent quality and durability I am so happy I ordered this product among all other options it is safe for the kids and it takes minimum space and so easy to clean never gets scratches or cracks and it can store so many thins so I am greatful. I tested the heat and the cold and it really keeps food warm and cold when on the fridge or just cooked. Awesome
"I‚Äôll admit, none of the pieces were as big as I‚Äôd hoped and the small cups are so small I don‚Äôt see much use in them, but that was something I should have considered before purchasing. Beyond, that, they are sturdy, clean, and do what they are advertised to do. I have them holding frozen fruit, they‚Äôve been through the dish washer, and the way it seals is easy and actually very solid."
"I love these so much. I‚Äôm sure at some point I‚Äôll lose enough I‚Äôll need more and I‚Äôll definitely be getting the same ones again.  They‚Äôre definitely leak proof, I‚Äôve literally put liquid in it and it was completely fine. They‚Äôre very durable, and have tons of sizes and shapes. I have storage for just about any food I could need it for."
"Great seal with the lid, no spills. Nice variety of sizes but I wish it came with a large container or two. I read reviews saying they had a hard getting the lid to snap but I've found that if the kid is aligned properly it snaps right on."
Good sizes. Lots of storage containers. The snap on tabs are a snap to get on. Not real thin plastic. Sturdy and I hope very durable. The only one drawback is that there is not a large container for holding alot of food. One of those might have been nice in this box.
I brought because I needed to food prep for surgery. Well out of all the containers I put in the freezer these were the ones that had no ice freeze inside the container
These containers are exactly what I was looking for. They are leakproof! Some other containers we had leaked through my daughter‚Äôs lunchbox and backpack. She loves these! They are also very easy to clean and save space in my fridge because they stack nicely. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.
These things are awesome. I needed something to throw in my book bag for work and these are the perfect containers. I love soup so now I can take it to work worry free and enjoy it during the day. The sizes are not huge but they are perfect for the portions I eat throughout the day. Oh I gave 4 stars for easy to clean because since they are square it's sometimes difficult to get to the corners but that's the least of my worries. In order to make these last as long as possible make sure to detach all parts of the lid for cleaning and drying or you will get mold.
I love these storage containers. The cover fit nice and tight for no leaks. I cleaned out all my mismatch containers and now only have these nice new ones.
These are actually the second set I‚Äôve bought of these and my new go to. Only for the people in my house though. anyone coming over that wants to leave with leftovers has to take the old Tupperware and Rubbermaid containers that I‚Äôm no longer using.
Like them so far! Seems to be sturdy. Just glad to have a new set. A little nervous about the paper inside the box that sets not to microwave contents in it for over 2 minutes. 2 minutes?! That's nothing. So if anyone does it and my set is ruined... oh help us all.
Went from a mess to this. Throw out a bunch and love how they stack. I will be Ordering More!!! Bet On It.. These are at a fair price and I know that they are freezer safe. Big Big Plus. Cooking for one.
"These are great containers, they do not leak and they are well built. The one thing I have noticed is when they are used in the microwave, the lid expands a little (even when left open) but doesn‚Äôt cause it to leak - just an observation.  I just purchased another set to account for meal prepping, I bought my first set in October 2020 and writing this review January 2021. The original set are holding up well."
It‚Äôs a great product...love it!!!! I love shopping when the vendor is espectacular. I ordered and it was delivered so fast and I don‚Äôt have amazon prime. The product is better than I expected. Great buy I am very happy with it!!!
i abs. love these. I like that i can stack them inside of each other for easy storage. They are dishwasher safe and clean really easy. The leakproof seal is good to have. I have throw my lunch in a bag and not worry about it leaking out. When these eventually wear away i will purchase more.
But these the first thing I noticed is how sturdy they are. They are thicker than the average tupperware. They also clean really good
"I love these containers! Variety of sizes for whatever you need, easy stacking storage, and seem very durable. I've only had a couple days but the out all my old mismatched containers and am excited (ahhh insert you know you're old when) for these!"
So far so good. They are all leak proof for sure and seem to be top quality. Some of the containers are a little smaller then they look in the picture but honestly that doesn‚Äôt effect their value to me. If anything changes I‚Äôll definitely update this review.
"So, this will get my praise. With as much Tupperware that I have gone through I must say that I have finally found one that works wonders and doesn't leak, air tight. Easy to clean and saves space when in refrigerator"
"I bought one set if them and liked them so much, I bought another. Highly recommend. Told the kids, don't put them in the dishwasher or microwave (even thought it says it can) to preserve them longer. They didn't listen and they still have that new sheen look and feel to them. I'm a very happy customer!"
"They are a little smaller than I expected. But they‚Äôre great for leftovers if there‚Äôs not too much, they stack OK in the icebox I‚Äôve had no problems, I wish they had larger ones."
"I wasn‚Äôt expecting much when I purchased these. I‚Äôve been pleasantly proven wrong. They are excellent at holding liquids. They look nice, have survived many of drops and they clean easily. Thus far none of my tomato based dishes have discolored these containers. That‚Äôs a check in my boxes. I will definitely purchase more."
"Amazing containers !! Best for food storage containers that can go in refrigerator and great for our lunches or meal preps for the hubby and I! I‚Äôve put inside my chicken, chili oil, spicy red rice, the containers are versatile. Simply best investment ever!"
I work in the Correctional field and have to have clear containers only to take into the facility and these are a God Send they don‚Äôt leak and very durable I‚Äôm buying a second set for home use too ‚ù§Ô∏è I give them 10/10
Got these to replace old tubware. I like them as soon is I took them out if the box. They feel heavier and thicker. I will say that for me it is hard to tell if the lid is on it all the way but no leaks so far.
"Just as the title says, I liked them so much I bought them for my grandparents too! My grandpa could only use one hand and the easy snaps made it a breeze to store his favorite snacks! Rinse and throw them in the dishwasher, they have yet to stain and they don't absorb smell! These were my first investment into real Tupperware as a young adult, and I have to say I am incredibly happy with this purchase! 5/5 stars!"
"These are Fantastic and built well! I love the way the lids stay on, and easy to take off as well! Not real thin either like some food storage containers can be! We have had them for over month and they have not gotten stained! Great product and Great Price!"
These are a good option for food storage. They work well for taking portions for my lunches. The majority of the containers are not very big so they are not good for storing large amounts of food. I have not had any problems with leakage because the seal is very good on these containers.
"Love the tight sealing lids with the gasket. Guarentees a spill proof seal. Great assortments of different sizes to accommodate any leftover need! Love that it can go in the refrigerator as well as the dishwasher, the microwave and the freezer! Will be ordering more the 30 ounce set next!"
"Smaller than I thought containers, though well made. Opted for the heavy plastic vs glass because I am a klutz. I have already dropped them a few times, with and without food and it handled perfectly."
These are one of the best decisions I have made. They are so cute and easy to clean. I love how easy it is to see what is inside. The lids are tight and leak proof.
"As with any food containers, over time either containers or lids fly off to another dimension, never to be seen again. I needed to replenish my stock, and this did the trick. They are solid, clean easily, dishwasher safe, store well, and seal wonderfully."
The containers are the perfect size to pack lunches or store leftovers. They are very sturdy and leak proof with 4 large snaps that seal perfectly.
My family needed something durable and leak proof. Every Sunday we bbq for the next few meals. My husband carries a yeti cooler to work and it's a pain to clean when something leaks. These let us sort lunch/dinners and avoid the mess. I plan on using the smaller ones for the babys snacks in the diaper bag.
When you are older sometimes it's hard to open and close those lids that you press in the middle. Some plastic stains especially with tomato sauce. These containers don't have either have that problem. They are flat on the top and stack well in the frig.
"Everything about these is wonderful - airtight - very airtight. Great sizes, nice big opening. But when I got them they were stuck together HARD. I thought I was going to have to return them! BUT ice inside of the inner stuck container with water, let get very cold. Then pour hot tap water over the outside container for a bit and they will come apart! Well worth it."
"Super nice and really big containers. If you bake and need to keep your flours, sugars, baking supplies airtight you must get these containers. The 2 biggest ones can easily hold 10 lb bags of flour or sugar. I put my brown sugars in the 2 medium ones and the 6 smaller ones can hold anything. I didn‚Äôt even use 4 of the smallest ones. They do take up a lot of counter space so check the measurements before you order. They are dishwasher safe and a great price for this amount of pieces."
"Cons first... They are a little hard to pull apart but not impossible, just don't try to do it if they got warm outside. Get to room temperature. Then no problem with most except the largest ones I needed a second person to pull.  That's it.  Otherwise all pros... great set of actually useful for a pantry sizes and for baking especially. Great price. Well made. No issues. Have had them for two months and use several daily to get to snacks and sugar for coffee and no problems. So very sturdy well made.  If you want them get them. Keeps chips and pretzels and crackers (go cheeze-its) crunchy much longer than a clip. No taste of plastic. I did wash them well twice and air them out for a day and a half first."
"Good amount of canisters. Air tight. Nice subtle grey color on ring in the lid. Not as sturdy as Tupperware canisters that I have, but will certainly do the job for food storage that I need. Packaged well, shipped quickly. Great value for this set of 10. Would recommend for many food items - chips, crackers, cereal‚Ä¶but probably not large amounts of sugar and flour - it would work, but I prefer a sturdier container for sugars/flours. Smaller amounts of sugars/flours would work."
"As a cook who regularly has on hand many lentils and grains and spices this is a must. They are very easy to clean with wonderful seals and easy to put a label on with nice smooth exteriors. I absolutely love these containers and I‚Äôm going to buy my third set soon, not because anywhere bad but because everything I own goes into storage containers once it‚Äôs been opened."
"These were exactly what I needed. We live in a rural area and had a major issue with mice this year. After throwing away a lot of food and replacing it, I needed to secure everything in my pantry. I purchased these and another set of different sizes. They are not ""Rubbermaid"" quality, but they are definitely good enough to last many years and they seal tight."
These are great for organizing a pantry. You can see what you have in the containers or label them. Makes a huge difference!!
"The containers are exactly as they are described. I like the variety of sizes, and the big ones hold my bulk flour and sugar perfect.  As other reviews stated, the containers are really difficult to get out from each other. I figured it out quickly that you have to shimmy each wall and pull while rotating it, but it definitely still requires some strength in your arms and fingertips.  I don‚Äôt recommend buying this set as a gift for someone who is old or has mobility problems without first helping them get the containers out. Nice set besides that for my moneyüëçüèº"
I'm very happy with my containers! They suited my needs perfectly. My pantry is organized and it looks so nice. The pen provided writes well and clearly on the stickers provided. Thank you for such nice products!!
"Bought for storing parrot pellets, seed, treats, etc. They seal up tight, and tetris into shelves perfectly. I may buy more for the human pantry and throw out all my misc plastic containers."
Like the fact that it seals as advertised and holds a good volume of product
Hasta ahorita me est√° durando y no tengo problemas.
"Service, product, packaging and delivery were excellent!"
The containers were large and I love how clear and non glossy they are. Made my pantry much les cluttered and made it easier to find whatever I was looking for.
Worked perfect for organizing the pantry. Lived the labels
I bought these hoping they would hold the big bags of pork rinds and they do.
Bought these to store my baking supplies in and they also work great for coffee and creamer too
"Very sturdy , only one lid did not have a strong latch"
"I will surely by again. I recommend these containers, you won‚Äôt be disappointed"
This set is really nice for storage in the kitchen.
"excelente compra, tama√±o ideal."
I need more time for this question because I just received these.
"Love these, great value for the money"
"1. we have a problem getting the 4 large ones apart, a plastic bag around the one inserted into the other and will not come apart. 2. the sizes are not what was shown on the Amazon site, should be 3 different sizes but we only received 2 sizes,"
"These storage containers are perfect for your bulk dry goods. They are airtight and sturdy. They are see through stack and store, which gives you easy access to your goods."
"It was missing one lid and another lid was broken. It isn‚Äôt transparent. Usable, but not a nice set"
"I purchased this product and a cover was missing, I communicated with customer service to see if they would be able to send me another cover, which they did. After utilizing this product, it isn‚Äôt as air tight as it seems. I put water inside the container, flipped it upside down to test, and water was leaking, and dripping out. If you are looking for an airtight product, please shop else where. This isn‚Äôt the product if that is what you are looking for. Aside from that, it‚Äôs very transparent, and the sizes are awesome. The only downer is that it isn‚Äôt air tight."
The containers are very sturdy and the sizes are great. They seal completely and look nice. The only problem is the lids that are broken inside the packaging. 2 of my lids are broken and I Can't seem to contact anyone about it.
"Not as advertised. When I received my order it did not contain the two 6.5L containers that it lists are included in this set. Also, the containers are extremely hard to pull apart. There are 4 that are still stuck together that are not budging. While these seem like they are good containers, very hard to use the entire set when I cannot separate them. Also very disappointed in the false advertising with the sizes included."
A bit expensive but they serve a good purpose
"Love these for storing dry goods like pasta, flour and sugar. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because one of the lids arrived cracked at one of the plastic ears that latch the lid down."
One container is broken and unusable
They are stuck inside each other and will not come apart. I broke two finger nails. Totally disappointed because they look like they could be nice..
"These advertised 3 sizes. Had only two. I couldn‚Äôt get them apart. Worst of all, they smelled disgusting!!!"
Quite difficult to open.
"Was disappointed that they did not come with the promised measuring scoops, as well as the white markers were dried out upon receiving"
They didn‚Äôt come with name tags they ok
3 lids arrived cracked. Make sure you remove rubber seal and dry after washing.
I like the products but some of the lids were broken
Lid broken
"Not sturdy at all, broke taking it out of package and trying to separate them."
"The two biggest containers hold my bread flour and all purpose flour without a bit of trouble, and just fit on my shelves. I love the wide opening, and the snap-on tops. They're exactly what's needed with things like flour and sugar. One thing though; the photos make it look like the containers are clear, somewhat hard plastic, and they're not. They're softer, and somewhere between clear plastic and tupperware in terms of transparency. This isn't a problem, but it was a surprise to me and I wanted to alert anyone who might have had the same idea about them. Also, the containers are dishwasher safe, but the lids should be hand washed because they can warp.  Bottom line, you get a LOT of storage for a very reasonable amount of money. This is a deal."
"Love these! I already have a couple sets of Praki food storage containers!! Love them!! They close easily and have a great seal to them. This set has three different sizes with matching lids. So the lids are different sizes too. They are pretty high and perfect for things like flour, sugar, cereal, pasta or anything you buy in bulk. I have also used these for ice blocks in drink coolers. They are perfect and keep the water frozen for longer period of time. Just fill them up near the top. Leave a little bit for water to expand. Then after it is frozen you just run water water on the sides and they will slide right out. It also comes with black labels to put on the front so you know what is in each container. You will be pleased with this set."
"I am exceptionally pleased with these storage containers. The quality is just as good as any of the name brand options, the sizes are very convenient for a variety of dry goods, and the lids snap into place firmly. I believe the seal created by the lids is airtight and will effectively keep out moisture, bugs, etc.. I especially like that the set came with four different sizes of containers, but all share the exact same lid. This makes it so much easier to find the ""correct"" lid for each container. The sizes are also very good. This set does not include any of the tiny useless containers that come with some sets. My cabinets have never been so organized!"
"So I purchased two different sets of these canisters of different sizes and I love them.  Below is what I said about the first set and these are no different. I tried to think of another way to describe them so my reviews would not look the same but my other review summed it up perfectly.  The only thing that matters is are these the brittle plastic with thin poor fitting lids. That is about all you need to know.  I am here to tell you I think the lids are just as thick or thicker than Tupperware, they fit securely too. The containers do not feel like they will crack when dropped.  For what it is worth there is a good selection of sizes and for the price you can't beat them.  If your butter tubs and cottage cheese containers are wearing out go ahead and treat yourself to a set or two of these, you'll thank me.  5 STARS"
"I absolutely love these containers! They come in so many different sizes and shapes for anything you would need. They have bug ones small ones, and they all fit very nicely together on a shelf. They look so beautiful and organized. You get a ton of different ones with the purchase. They even work great as left over containers. These are perfect for so many things. I do wish they had some bigger square ones I. This package but the square long ones aren't bad."
"I'll start by saying we really like these containers. But, like many of these container brands that advertise ""clear"" storage bins, they're not truly clear (they have a slightly opaque ""frost"" appearance).  They offer you plenty of room for storage, and they fit very well on short shelves."
These work just as well as the expensive name brand ones for 1/2 the price. Having the diffrent sizes in this package is wonderful. These stack nicely in your panatry and are easy to see what you have and are low on. I did not use the lables that are provided since my pantry products change on my needs. They do have a very tight seal on them and have kept what is put in them fresh.
"These are truly great containers. They hold a lot, the lid isn't a struggle to get on or off but it does seem to be airtight. They stack nicely on both the 12"" shelves and the 10"" shelves in my pantry. Nice, clear plastic so I can see exactly what needs to be replenished. And, they cleaned easily. :) 10/10 would recommend."
These containers are perfect for big items. You can use the skinny ones for cereal and the bigger ones for cooking staples like flour and sugar and you can actually fit the whole bag in them.  The seal is great to keep critters out and makes it easy to clean.
"Great for storage, after testing, it is air tight & water proof. Sure it will be long lasting. The chalk labels are perfect for repurposing and don‚Äôt come off easily in water."
"I couldn't wait to organize my pantry with this container set. But once I got them they were extremely difficult to pull apart (they come stacked inside each other) and the snap lids don't seem to be the most durable. Other than that, they come in a variety of sizes that are great for storing dried food items like flour, pasta, beans, etc. They stack nicely which also helps save space. So far they serve their purpose, but it's only a matter of time before the lid closures snap in half."
They are very good
They work as they say they do. Lids snap tight and they hold a lot!! They will keep the bugs out and your food fresh. I'm very happy with them. I will be buying more of them as I need them. I might even give the set as a gift. They do not vaccum out the air like but the seal is tight.
"Sturdy, airtight, no odor and the sizes make sense."
it perfectly fits into my pantry for the pulses
They fit so well in the pantry with all the other containers.
Great quality
"these are great to organize my food supply room. i have ordered more . great for beans , rice, noodles, pasta, so much more."
"Looks great, holds a good volume , easy to open"
Everything came well packed and unbroken! Wish I had more smaller ones. The larger sizes are huge! Would recommend!
"As usual, I cleaned all the recipients, I was surprised to see how the water turned greyish. The lids clipped perfectly on top of the containers. Being airtight, anything inside will remain fresh and ready to use. I use it to store, cereals, flour, sugar ,etc. I am more than satisfied with the product so far. There are other more expensive brands but I think that it offers everything I needed. Why pay more?"
"Fast delivery. The variety of sizes are great. They are exactly what I needed. The extra large, hold a good amount of flour and sugar. I used the large size, for a big bag of marshmallows and the other for the costco pancake mix. The medium size, (larger than expected) work well for items like the large can of coffee or hot chocolate. They come with labels and a marker. Reasonably priced."
"My pantry now looks organized and neat, love the containers, good sizes and airtight. Love the black labels and the white pen that comes with them. All the containers were well packed. I will order another set in the future to organize my craft room"
"Ordered these to store dry items in my pantry after dealing with some spring bugs in my house. These containers are large, and I use them to store multiple small items, or the big ones can store my flours and bulk cereal! I'm very happy I purchased these, I have heace of mind that my food is protected and will stay fresh longer!"
"The containers are fantastic, fit in my pantry and look really good. So good I bought more."
"These are so amazing!! I bought 2 sets, and now my life is so organized... They're amazing!! I even have friends that have purchased after seeing my pantry!!"
"J'ai employ√© ces bo√Ætes pour la farine, sucre, chocolat etc. Je peux facilement voir la quantit√© qu'il reste dans la bo√Æte, et ne pas √™tre prise au d√©pourvue lorsque je fais une recette. L'int√©rieur de mes armoires parait beaucoup plus propre et en ordre."
Good material overall I love everything about this storage containers. They close very tight and are easy to clean. Saves so much space in my pantry compared to the round ones I had.
I would like a wider variety of sets of the same size.
"Here's my problem: We've been married 32 years (that's not the problem) and our collection of storage containers is out of control. (I want to call them Tupperware, but that's probably rude in a Rubbermaid review.) It's embarrassing how many mismatched containers and lids we have. It's not just embarrassing though; it's infuriating. I cook a lot and I pull my fair share in the kitchen, but I hate storing leftovers because it's going to end in frustration when I can't find the right lid to go with the container. I also hate putting them away after I wash them, because heaven knows where they're supposed to go and I'm not willing to risk the avalanche when I open that cupboard.  That's my dilemma. And it's truly one of my few gripes about my blissful marriage.  I got so excited when I saw this collection, because I thought it might be good enough to swap out for many of the containers in our Tupperware cupboard of doom. I was so excited when I saw this set of what appeared to be quality storage containers. How cool would it have been if we could have jettisoned half of our containers and replaced them with these, where all the sizes are predictable and all the lids would match?  Unfortunately, this just isn't quite the collection that I hoped it would be. These will be good for my sack lunches (someday when we return to our offices again), but they won't really be that useful for our household leftovers.  The problem is that the smaller size is just a little too small. Even worse though, is that these aren't as thick and durable as the Rubbermaid containers that we're used to. These aren't going to last many years at all, which is very disappointing.  I'm trying to be fair with my rating, so I won't give this three stars. These will be good for our work lunches, so they deserve five-ish stars, but they're too flimsy to last very long, so I bumped the rating back down to four stars. I hope that makes some sense."
"Finally Tupperware that doesn‚Äôt include pieces I won‚Äôt actually use. It‚Äôs super functional. My husband is also notorious for ruining Tupperware (breaking, letting food rot, losing it) so this set is a good price point instead of him losing a glass oxo container that I paid 20 for. Marriage saver definitely."
"I've been trying to get back into meal prepping, 3 to 6 days (depending on how many meals I plan for the day). What I like about these, they hold a good amount. 5 cups and you get 8 containers. I fix a lot of protein bowls, oatmeal and steamed veggies. These work perfect for all the above and so much more.  Again, you get 16 pieces (containers and lids) meaning you have 8 containers to run with, and that's great for a single day meal or 4 days of 2 meals. I admit, if I just prep a meal per day, I'll use the extras to store leftover chicken or ground beef in. It just depends, for the most part.  These are very durable, none of the cheap stuff that cracks, and the lids are the best I've seen for something along this line. I'm actually considering the 3.7 Cup for stuff like steamed veggies and protein. Those are the rectangle ones that have 2 sections for those wondering. I want to up my game, and start getting shredded, so those would be a huge game changer and keep me on track.  If you're looking for something that's easy to clean, leak proof and work like a charm. I highly suggest these. They're pretty affordable, and it's like the saying goes... you get what you pay for. So, I have no problem spending money on stuff that's worth it."
"These Rubbermaid containers work! You can use them for""everything!"". I see some reviews say that you can't fit a sandwich, well, first of all, you can! Just choose the long shallow one! Second, people usually use a zip lock bag for sandwiches! The same person said that the smallest one is useless, NOT TRUE! You could use them for chopped onions that you didn't use, or for chopped anything! Or, you can use them for that especially delicious gravy that you don't want to throw out but only have a little left. Also, nuts, candy, sunflower seeds, etc. You can find a use for ""every single size!"" The lids stay in tight! Just make sure that you hear the click when you press all four corners shut. Worth every penny! I will be buying these as needed, forever!"
"My husband and I have been using these containers for some time. I ordered a replacement set on Prime day. Same good quality, but the only downside is if you microwave leftovers regularly it will start to leave pretty bad staining and some residue which gets frustrating. Overall a good set of containers though."
Seriously surprised with the quality of these containers. Just started meal prepping for two people and I spent a boatload of money in a store on other containers that when I went to use them found out that the lids didn't stay on any of them!! These are amazing. Lids for like they should. Easy to clean. I love the color too!
"These are excellent food storage containers! My main concern was that the lids would not close tightly enough and might slip off or cause leakage. However, after using them for a while, I decided to revise my 4 star rating to a 5 star rating. The containers wash very well in the dishwasher and come out looking like new and in perfect condition. In fact, the lids now close even more securely AFTER washing them a couple of times. These Rubbermaid Food Storage Containers are excellent and exactly what I was hoping to get. I am extremely happy to have found them."
"Update. Been in the dishwasher twice. They held up beautifully! So far so good üòú  Oh my gosh, just got these today and I cannot believe how perfect they are for meal preps. We don't always need the bigger ones for meal prep, BUT if you do, you have them. I am using the sandwich size ones and I now have plenty. These feel sturdy. The lids close tight and are easy to remove. Love the color too! Will come back to update a bit later in the year after I've had some time to run them through the wringer üòâ"
"I ordered the Ruby Red set of 26 to replace my old storage containers and so far I am very happy with them. I love the variety of sizes and so far, they seem to be very durable. As others have said, eventually you will have little marks on the inside from heating food in the microwave. To avoid this problem, transfer your food to a glass container before reheating. The lids store very nicely under the containers and I nest some of the less-used small containers inside the really large ones. I am able to store all 26 of these containers on one shelf. Overall, I am really satisfied with these containers."
"These bowls are the perfect portion size and don't leak! I bought a different brand before I bought these and I ended up with liquid in my lunch bag. I have not had that problem with my Rubbermaid bowls. They seal well, are durable and easy to clean. I can not say enough why I love these. Seriously, the best buy for the money."
"This product is durable and not flimsy. I have bought some meal prep containers that crack on the first time of closing them. Not with these, they are thick and sturdy. I have also had no prep containers discolor and have a weird plastic looking spotty film appear. So far, not the case. Shipping was fast the product was packaged well, and it has a great variety of containers for kids lunches. Definitely recommend."
This was a gift for my brother. I had no problems with the Rubbermaid but I only wish it had come in a better box than just a brown cardboard box with the Rubbermaid stamped in black on the box.
"I was glad to begin using these. I use them to place food for lunch when I go to work. On weekends I warm my pancakes, bacon and eggs for breakfast. The lids snap tight and keep the food warm as long as I don't wait too long. A good price and so far I like these."
When I received these I had thought I had ordered something different but I had already thrown away all my old yucky containers so I kept these. LOVE THEM!!! Even my husband likes them. Good sizes and great quality. Very easy to clean. I would order this style again.
These enable us to cook a large amount at a time and freeze for many easy meals later. Love them.
I love these containers for leftovers that will be chilled and then frozen. It is also nice to have them available for sending food home with guests. Easy to clean and they stack well in the fridge or the freezer.
"Lids work perfect. As described. Definitely would buy again. Hard to find sturdy containers where the lids actually work. Ive waisted more $$$ on Amazon trying to find storage containers that you can use. Well, this company figured out how to do it lol."
Love these! My first time using them and am happy with the size. Fits nicely in husbands lunchbox and it holds enough for a dinner or a lunch for him. Really like the division of space. Lids snap TIGHT but think they will become brittle like others? Dont know yet-
"I don't know how well they would hold up if regularly washed in a dishwasher or put in a microwave, as I hand-wash mine and don't microwave them, but they're holding up well so far."
These containers are great! Color is nice. They wash great in the dishwasher and best is they don't leak. I like the variety of sizes and that some come with a divided area. I would purchase again!
"These are a little more challenging to snap shut, but once you get used to how it is done, there is not too much angst. Nothing is going to leak after getting these lids on! Overall, I am very happy with the product."
Bought these for my son for his new house. They are easy to stack and store. They keep the food fresh. I highly recommend
Use for pets in rescue. Can label them with food title for individual critters. Lids fit tightly but not too hard to get off. Freeze stuff fine in them Have not put into dishwasher however so not tested that. Although they will probably work just fine.
"I love these take-alongs. They are also good for two entree meals like soup and sandwich, sandwich and chips, chicken and fries, etc."
"Overall Great Storage, and lunch on the go. we can pack our lunches or dinner left overs. It's the perfect size."
I am not normally picky about brands....but when it comes to Tupperware I HAVE to have rubbermaid. I bought to sets. Love how you can use in freezer and microwave!
"We removed all of our old plastic containers and got all new. We know the lids fit the bottoms. No more struggling to find a top to fit a bottom, that's just a smidge too small."
"These are great to pack my husband's lunch in different sizes like them alot no leaking ,easy to clean good value"
I bought these to do meal prep for the week. I work a lot of hours and this makes my life so much easier with two children. They are great quality. They work very well in the microwave. And they are really easy to clean.
These containers are great to use! We have been able to use these containers to deliver meals for family and friends and it was very durable! No leaks!!!! Also able to stay hot for a long time as well with no insulation.
I was very skeptical at first...seemed flimsy...but...Use them every day...put them in the dishwasher...lids on top bottoms on bottom...holding up extremely well...lid is tricky...buy once you get the knack...easy...
"Have used Rubbermaid products in the past and this order of all of these containers is very good,"
The lids fit tight and the various sizes come in handy and stack well to cut down on space in refrigerator.
Easy to clean with a sponge. I use these for food prep. Affordable.
"These are great. I make salads on Monday for the week for me and my partner for a supper meal. The salads look, taste the same on day 7 as day 1."
They work very well. They are very good for storing leftovers or other foods. They also have a good variety of sizes.
just what we needed to start off. Though it becomes very flimsy when heat is involved
These are not a higher end container. But they are not meant to be. They are good quality though and great for lunches or leftovers. Good for the price!
I have a very small kitchen. Love the stack ability of these and are very good quality. Nice size for packing lunch and cooking ahead and freezing. Love them!
I had non matching tupperware bowls and lids. I needed to buy new ones. This is perfect and all in one spot.
The containers and lids stack easily and are easy to clean. I can't comment on their durability because I haven't had them long enough and I don't have a dish washer. They are well worth price.
Not much to say. Came sooner than expected. Color and sizes were exactly as shown in the add. Very happy with purchase.
"These are very nice, thru out my assorted containers save from various products and installed these. !"
Used for storage
"They are microwaves safe, so far its been good until spaghetti and it left some stains on the plastic. Which happens with other bowls but thats the only flaw is it does stain with red sauce if you plan on storing. Otherwise, it holds up well and is pretty good quality for the price! I would recommend this for your meal preps, snacks, leftovers. I recommend this product."
Great product and the size is great for most items. Cannot beat the price for 50 cents apiece!
Been using these for years. Same good product.
It would have cost me at least $45 just to get these differing sizes individually. Just the right count of containers for weekly usage at such a great price. Highly used in my household for multiple meal preps this far with great quality and durability of daily microwave and refrigerated use.
Was super thankful to get these in the mail. For some reason we lose all of our plastic containers so ordering a set was great. My only complaint is that they stain super easily and my others from Walmart do not but they‚Äôre still great!
Multiple sizes make leftover storage a breeze. More small 4 oz. ones than anyone could need.
My last ones of this brand lasted a long time. I like the different sizes for my meal prep.
THE PRESENTATION IS GOOD BUT OVERALL STURDINESS AND EASY TO CLEAN NOT SO GOOD
"I didn‚Äôt realize this was split into areas. I thought it was a square food holder. Oh well, I‚Äôll use it."
Made well and very handy for leftovers or just to share food with family and friends. :)
These were way better than expected for the amount that came with the set and the price!
Perfect size. I use them all the time
Good product
Love love love the color.
"These containers work as expected, pricing is reasonable.. Variety of sizes is very convenient"
Exactly what I've been looking for! Great value for these very attractive bowls. So pleased!
Tal cual esperaba que fuera.
"fast delivery, great product, great price"
Lots of different sizes and shapes to choose from. Very convenient for everyday.
Most important to me was it being leak proof! I throw it in my car and it's still tight when I get to work!
At this low a price for excellent quality plastics I dont get upset when my husband loses or leaves one somewhere.
These are really durable and great for the money
Great value and worth the money
GREAT SET FOR THE PRICE. BROUGHT IT TO REPLACE MY OLDER ONES. VERY HAPPY
Like that it is more steady than some other types and easier to clean
Excellent for storing food which we shared with family in this pandemic. Well made
These are Amazing! I can't believe there isn't that many reviews. I took a chance because these were cheaper. They are definitely air tight. They fit way more than a 15.9oz box of cereal. These are Perfect!!
"I am a review junkie when it comes to buying any product online. I took a chance on this product despite there being limited reviews, although the ones present were good! I cannot recommend this product more! We just moved and I have been organizing my pantry and was looking for cereal containers because my little humans always forget to reseal the cereal bags. These containers are made of a really nice, quality, thick plastic! Plus they come with chalkboard label stickers, a chalk pen!, and a cute little measuring cup set. A million stars for this! If you‚Äôre debating, consider this review and do yourself a favor and BUY THESE!!!"
"Love the price and the quality of these containers! They definitely fit more than just one box of cereal, they have an easy open top and is sealed very well. Pictures show the size of the containers compared to an 18oz box of cereal"
This was a replacement for our original order that came in damaged. The original was in a small box just bigger than the containers and the outer container was broken. This order came in a larger box and had bubble protection to keep it safe. We have already ordered another set because my wife love them.
""
"The lids lock securely. The pour spout is great for my older mom who has problems with lids... and keeping the cereal bag and box closed adequately. No more spilled cereal on the floor. My dog is not so happy, as he could always count on grandma for a surprise treat. The measuring cups are an added bonus."
"These are awesome quality for how cheap they are. They seal well and are super clean and modern looking. An overall awesome deal, and great quality for the price!"
"Highly recommend! Bought these for cereal storage. When they arrived one of them was cracked. There was a flyer in the package saying what to do if you received something damaged. So I contacted customer service (the plastic house company, not Amazon), snapped a picture of the broken container, and explained that my package arrived damaged. The very next morning, they replied back saying a new set was going to heading out to me. Wow!! So rad! I like that these containers are as bulky or large as some of the other ones specifically for cereal- these are slim and hold a whole box of cereal! Will def be looking for me of their products for all my container needs. Excellent product and even better customer service."
"This is definitely worth buying. It was fast delivery it comes with 4 containers with lockable lids labels Measuring cups and a marker I even got a thank you note from the company the containers are a decent size and easy to use I like the fact I can label and have enough stickers left over for instructions to put on the containers (rice) altho they are cereal containers as you can see I‚Äôm using for flour, sugar, and rice if your looking online and trying to decide if it‚Äôs the right size you need it will hold a 10lb bag of sugar the rice and flour where half way or almost gone but it holds a good amount as you can see. I would definitely recommend"
"I love these cereal containers! When they arrived, they looked smaller because they are slim but (to test out the claim of holding a standard bag of cereal) I emptied a 24oz family sized box of Frosted Flakes into one and it took the whole bag. Filled to the rim but not overflowing (make sure to shake a little to let things settle). NOW, I have reorganized one of my tall cabinets which could only hold 2 bulky cereal containers side by side but now I can fit 3! Plus, I can fit them 2 deep which means.... I can stack 12 of these containers comfortably in one tall cabinet (pics included for reference - mind you, this is with a pullout tray installed taking up some space, so probably could fit more?). Suffice it to say... I jumped back on to buy another same day which arrived today! I don't write alot of reviews but this goes to show how impressed I was. The reusable stickers are amazing too. Great idea! Gives my cabinet a kind of ""upgraded"" feel (for lack of a better word). Colorful measuring cups come with it as well. Perfect for measuring out how much cereal you want if watching your servings or creating snack bags (which I do alot for developing healthy snacking habits)"
"Overall all the containers are very sturdy, Washing and drying was easy to do and I was able to place the full family size cereal in one container. These are child protected so it‚Äôs not easy for toddlers to open the lids. I wanted these containers for lentils as my 2year old kept taking off the lids for regular containers so I got these instead and have already placed them in my pantry. I like how it came with a scope as it‚Äôs easier to scope out the amount you will need, fits perfectly in each container. The lid is sealed all the way that will help with freshness, I placed cookies in one container so not sure how fresh they will be the next time I open the lid but just by closing the lid you will notice the tightness that will block the air. These are one of the best food storage containers I got as they have all the things I was looking for."
"What can I say! No more stale cereal! These containers have a nice air tight seal, not just on the main lid, but also on the flap lid that makes it easy to access to pour or to scoop out of. We got the set of 4 that also came with measuring cups, and stickers that you can write on so you know what is in the containers. The size of these is perfect for fitting boxes of cereal, but again, as I said you could use them for anything! Noodles, baking supplies, whatever your want!  I bought these for cereal, and I love how similar in size it is to a box of cereal. They still fit in my cupboard, which is a huge bonus for me! It easily fits a 12ox box of cereal! I am really happy with this purchase!"
"I‚Äôve been wanting to get these containers for some time now. I just couldn‚Äôt see spending so much money on it. But we had problems with ants and they eventually got into all 4 boxes of cereal that we had. I‚Äôm so glad I found these for the price. Fits a normal, 16oz bag of cereal, with extra room. Most going to order another set."
""
"The containers are really good quality and can hold alot - a whole family size box of cereal. But really, I‚Äôm leaving this review for their amazing customer service! I had an issue with my marker being dried out and wrote to them to see if I could get another marker and they ended up sending a whole new set with expedited shipping. This company really goes above and beyond for their customers and I can‚Äôt recommend them enough!"
"If you want 'FRESH' Cereal, then just put them in these containers! I didn't realize that as I was using up my cereal that it was getting 'stale' after about half a box. I bought these 'Air-Tight' plastic containers, and NOW my cereal is fresh to the end. Very easy to pop on the top after you pour cereal in, and it 'SNAPS' when you push the plastic lid down. Not only do they keep things fresh, they are a colorful addition to my counter! Also comes with an assortment of scoops in case you want to scoop out what you have in there. These would also be good for other things, like baking powder, nuts, etc."
These work perfect for storing 3d printer filament. I've been able to fit all of my 1 and 2kg rolls in these without issue. They're air tight and not too bulky. They also come with label stickers and a chalk ink marker so that labels can be updated when the contents change. The company also provides great customer service. I highly recommend this product!
"I only needed one but I bought four and am glad I did. I swapped out my old granola container for one of these. Their slim, tall fit perfect for countertop storage under cabinets. The marker was a nice touch.  Will work on transferring some other pantry ingredients in the near future and possibly purchase another set.  Would highly recommend as this solution offers a good volume of storage and is compact enough to maintain a presence on the counter instead of having to tuck the contents away in a cupboard somewhere.  Cheers"
Very happy with the outcome overall. The seals are great. I combined this set with the 15piece set. Note: The containers are not clear...they are slightly opaque..but clear enough to see whats inside.
These came in handy for my kids cereal. They keep the cereal fresh longer and I don‚Äôt have to worry about open boxes and bags of cereal anymore. They are really nice size so you can fit big boxes of cereal in them. They come with handy labels and even a marker to write what type of cereal is in each container. This gives my kids an extra chore to do and gives them fresh cereal for longer. I like it.
These containers have an excellent seal on the top to keep air out and keep the food fresh. Even the flip top has a rubber gasket which most containers don‚Äôt!!! I did receive cracked containers but I followed the instructions on the slip in the package to have the issue resolved and I had a replacement within 2 days!!! Five stars alone just for the customer service!
"I got these on sale for about $16 and my initial thought was, omg they are so small. But they do hold a lot and are extremely sturdy. The top is super air tight. They also look very good in my pantry. I will say to wait for the marker to dry off after you write on the black stickers, or else it will smear off the writing."
"Love these! Great product for a great price. One lid did come broken (the hinge part on the top that opens was broken, still seals but the window part just comes off when opened), probably broke in shipping, and the company more than made it right. Great customer service!!"
""
"I was somehow skeptical that these would hold much when I first saw them, but I was quickly proven wrong. After washing them, I set about emptying warehouse-sized bags of cereal and chips into these. Every single item fit with room to spare! I love these so much, I went back and bought a second set! I'm about to buy another set and have them shipped to my daughter; she's going to love them!"
This product is great. High quality has large and square pouring spout. Fits full standard size cereal box in each container. My kids are so excited in the morning to pour their favorite cereals from these amazing containers. I can't imagine my life without these.
"Easy to clean and use, I really recommend them. Reading the comments that alot of ppl said regarding being damaged, I took a chance and buy it as well I checked mine right away and came in perfect conditions. I wasn't expecting to come with the measuring cups, that was a surprise for me."
I LOVE these! Our cereal stays fresh which is a nice change when you have children in the house that don‚Äôt close boxes. It‚Äôs saving us a ton of money. They look nice and organized and are easy to clean. I was impressed that there was absolutely no chemical smell.
"So far,i like these storage containers. They are practical,easy to clean,easy to use, cute and they make organizing look good! Surprisingly, the 18 oz Honey bunches of oat didn't fill up one container but the 18 oz Kix didn't even fit in one container. The labels are easy to wipe out and they are reusable. There are extra labels to use later."
"3.7L. Very happy with volume, will accept an entire box of cereal. Lids fit good. Easy to clean. Came with stickers and a marker. Pictures show a 12oz box of Trader Joes O‚Äôs, probably could fit two boxes. Other pic is one whole 22oz bag of Special K Red Berries from the CostCo 2 bag box (grocery stores usually carry 11.7 and 16.9 (family size) boxes). Just got today, can‚Äôt comment on fresh/stale or durability."
""
"I love these! I was worried about them being to small but they were perfect for the size cereal box I usually buy, then I put a box of vanilla wafers in it which 2 boxes of wafers could fit! They have a nice tight seal when they close. This is perfect for anything you want to store to keep fresh! Great deal! It also came with scoopers and labels"
"These store so much! Absolutely love these! I needed something for cereal, flour and sugars and these work perfectly. The seal seems to be really tight and they're tall but skinny so they store a lot but don't take up as much space as my other containers. They came with these cute little labels that you can write on which was really nice. I plan on getting another set to store snacks and pet foods. I washed them out before using them and was surprised at how easy they are to clean. There plenty of space for your hand to fit so you can even scrub the bottoms easily."
"These containers are well made and are airtight, preventing spoilage."
"The most basic requirements, for me, in a container are good seal and easy to clean-these containers are so great- the covers seal very tightly therefore keeping my flour and cereal nice, fresh and especially bugs free. Also they are super easy to wash, the rubber along the edges of the cover is easily removable and once washed and dried it's super easy to put it back in place. The added stickers and chalk marker are such a cute and functional detail (especially when storing different types of flour). And I didn't even realize- therefore I was surprised to get in the package a colorful set of measuring cups- I can never have enough of those. I really recommend these conrainers!!"
"These containers were very sturdy. I love how thick the plastic is on them. They have clips on the sides and front of the containers with a rubber seal to ensure air, dust, dirt or even bugs can‚Äôt get into them. It has an a flap on the front so kids can pour their own cereal / snack out without removing the whole lid. I really enjoyed these containers and happy about them! I used to have cheap ones from dollar tree that eventually the thin plastic lid cracked. These were the perfect replacement."
"This is an excellent product. Perfect size, high quality, and great design. I love that the pour spout latches so that it stays open while pouring out the cereal. I was initially a little disappointed because one of the lids was missing the large gasket, which made it impossible to close the lid properly and rendered the one container useless. I contacted the seller (an email was provided with the packaging) and asked for a gasket to replace the one which was missing. Instead, the seller sent me a whole new set of containers! I am delighted with the containers and with the customer service. Highly recommended."
This is the perfect additional to my kitchen. The seller is great. Mine arrived broken and they replaced it. I absolutely love it. Very easy to sue and they came with measuring spoons. Easy clean as well.
I received this product and noted upon unboxing that the 4th or outermost container was cracked and a piece was missing on the bottom rendering this container unable to be used. I contacted customer service through email and the issue was resolved the next day! Great communication through the entire process. I love the containers for cereal and other similar items. Keeps them fresh and easier than boxes. I would highly recommend this product and this company!
"This was a Christmas gift. My sister has issues with critters getting in her cereal and etc. She really appreciated these. I was visiting her this Christmas and washed them for her and put cereal in two of them. Perhaps it is user error, but all of the clamps didn‚Äôt go down easily at first. With a little TLC, everything turned out fine. Everyone is happy."
I loooooove these! I got two packs! With the first two one of the sets came broken but customer service was amazing and got me new ones 2 days later. They work wonderful fits a box of cereal 18oz and more than half of the big bags of cereal. You do have to be careful with how you grab them if you grab them from the top because it can come un done if you hold on it the wrong way.
"I love these containers and am currently using them for cereal. They fit a regular size box of cereal with room to spare I could even fit a large portion of a super size cereal box. I also love that they are short enough to fit in my cabinet shelves, many cereal storage containers will not fit but these do and I am so happy."
"These are perfect for protein powders! I hate the ugly bulky jars they usually come in and crowding the counter. The containers are an amazing solution. I also tested the spout opening and the scooper fits - chefs kiss! Counter is clutter free, organized but most importantly: FUNCTIONAL"
"We're using these for cereal here in buggy Florida. I opened a box of cereal and found ants inside- now i immediately pour it into these containers, and haven't seen an ant since. They seal VERY well. Added bonus was the black labels and white pen for labeling the product."
"These containers are perfect for storing cereal. Mine came with labels and scoops, but the kids have spouts you can pop open and pour. Very sturdy. Some complained about them not being clear; I would say these containers are clear-ish, more on the clear than ‚Äúish‚Äù side, they aren‚Äôt like clear glass if that‚Äôs what you are looking for, but definitely not milky. Love these, definitely worth the cost!"
"First I bought 4, then I bought another 4 size they were affordable compared to some stores. They are so great. They fit Larger size cereal boxes . Not family size ."
"This set of containers come with a set of measuring cups, labels, maker which was a nice surprise. One of the lid tops arrived broken. This company replaced not only the lid but the whole set of containers within 3 days!! These seal great & hold a big box of cereal, flour, sugar really any sugar a try staple. Nice pouring lid as well. Great purchase & amazing customer service."
Awesome product for a great price. I use these containers to put off brand cereals in. The kids don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt question as long as it crunches. These are great for a family with children as you don‚Äôt have to worry about the food item getting property closed.
"Love the square pouring hole, cereal does not get stuck like the round openings. They have a very odd smell when they arrive. I had to wash them twice. But I love them! Perfect for cereal."
These do the job. The ONLY thing I wish was different about the containers is the black company label on side. I won't take away stars because it is clearly shown in the pictures but it takes away from the appeal.
"In the process of upgrading my pantry. As food costs continue to rise, maximizing freshness and shelf life is essential. The sizes of the containers are spot on, good thickness of container walls, lids are low profile. Definitely would purchase these again if I need more."
"Very handy, perfect size, holds a family sized box of cereal. I put the whole bag inside for easier cleanup & cut the top of the plastic. Love these & need more!"
"They look great in cabinet, just what I was looking for, perfect size!!! Received them today and I'm happy with my purchase. :)"
My wife is the most organized person I know and she has put her stamp of approval on these containers. They seal nicely and they even come with measuring cups that fit perfectly inside the containers. The little labels are also a plus. Highly recommend these
""
These where just the right size as there are just the 2 of us! Holds regular size box of cereal! We don‚Äôt buy the big boxes as it takes us forever to use it all! Families with kids may want bigger containers! These are well made!
I live on the coast where everything attracts the moisture in the air. In 60 plus years I did not know flour gets moldy. Guess what: here on the Oregon coast it does. The weather never gets warm enough to dry outthe air so everything either has rice or rice sachets in it or airtight containers. Won't need to throw away moldy food any more. They work great!
Really great quality. Closure feels right and secure. Containers feel strong like they will last a good while. I really enjoyed them adding the stickers and marker. I‚Äôm not sure how practical it will be for cereal if you switch up your variety a lot. I‚Äôm nervous the stickers will be hard to remove or change but who knows. I haven‚Äôt tried yet. Over all highly recommend.
Really helpful and useful storage containers. Very sturdy and holds a full olbox of cereal with room to spare.. Came with chalk stickers that are great and measuring cups.. Very sturdy and reasonably prices containers that look great.
"This product is marketed for cereal but I put pasta in it. I was able to fit 3 boxes of pasta in each because of how big they are which I really appreciated. These could also be used for flour or sugar, the possibilities are really endless. The too has a pour spout which is super convenient and it closes snuggly all around. They also came with a set of measuring cups."
"I bought these to organize my ""baking cabinet"". They seem to snap nice and tight and are easy to use. They are a great size for my bulky dry goods. I wish they had more labels in case I wanted to change the contents. I have only had them a short time. Hoping they keep things fresh as they are replacing my old trusty Tupperware. So far they are great."
"I always have a hard time finding containers to fit my cabinets. The cereal boxes are always too big and I end up keeping them on their side, but this totally fixes the issue. I can fit a family size box into it without overspill, and they fit perfectly inside my cabinets with extra room to spare. I‚Äôm definitely buying more for everything else I need to keep fresh!"
The containers are bigger than what I thought and that‚Äôs a good thing. The material seems sturdy and in good quality. They seem like good air tight storage. Loved that they came with different size scoopers. Also loved the labels. I washed them and they were quick to dry. I‚Äôm super satisfied with this product.
Amazing product! Extremely effective for what it is used for and I have gotten tons of compliments. It has a nice grip to hold onto the container while using it and it‚Äôs easy to see what is inside the container. The description alone is spot on. I would buy a dozen of these if I could. Love these!!!! Must buy!
"Our cereal loves their new apartment. Spacious, good location, near bus line. In good safe neighborhood, always something to do. Never gets stale. (Lol)"
These are made out of a very sturdy material. I have ordered these 3 times and my pantry looks great. Because they are clear you will be able to see what you are low or out of making your shopping list easy to complete
"These containers are amazing in quality and the price is unbeatable! Super sturdy, providing excellent locking performance. The seal is totally hermetic, keeping the food staples fresh and the moisture out. The square opening is also great, allowing for comfortable pouring. So happy with my purchase!!!"
These containers are great! They have made our pantry so much more organized and let‚Äôs us see how much food is left and keeps the food fresh. I bought a couple sets and love them. I wish I would have bought them Sooner.
"Been using this product to keep sugar ants out / or aka ghost ants native to Florida , if you have ant issues or just want to keep your items fresh longer these containers are great and seal perfectly !"
Loved how well they seal and were just the right size to fit on the counter. A jumbo bag or box of cereal will take more than one container though.
"These are my first glass containers and I am never going back to plastic. They are just so nice. They are shaped great, feel very sturdy, and they look great. I absolutely love that glass doesn't pick up odors like plastic does. I probably don't have to tell you how nasty those plastic containers can get. I feel safer storing food in these, for some reason. I like to freeze bananas a lot to make nicecream, and in the past I've had containers crack when I tried to take them out. These are so solid and durable that not only can I freeze bananas in them, I can also go at them with the hand blender when they are still in the glass container. Now that's convenience. I think the sizes are just perfect. One is pretty small, exactly the right size to make chia seed pudding in. The middle one holds about as much as a large cereal bowl, I would say, and the largest one is a great size for leftovers. It holds a lot. I'm good with just the three glass storage bowls that this set comes with, but as soon as I expand my cooking and I need more, I am definitely getting more of them."
"So I have purchased two sets of these because I had purchased others years ago, like over 15 to 20 years ago that I still used regularly for storing leftovers in the fridge to throw in the microwave back and forth a few times, never ever has one broke or cracked. I decided to purchase more to get rid of the old stained Rubbermaid storage containers I‚Äôve been using for years also that just get stained and pitted after each use. With these after every use just wipe clean with no problem. As for the people who have complained theirs have broken, I‚Äôm more than likely to guess it was cause of their use or abuse of the products. I grew up with my mother using everything Pyrex and to this day over 50 years those are still being used daily. So for my, Pyrex is really my own go to for food storage and reheating, may be expensive but they will last forever!"
"I actually got these bowls because I wanted to make a layered jello salad. I didn't have any clear containers. The glass of these bowls in very thick like the Pyrex measuring cups. Someone said that the covers were hard to get on. All you have to do is center the lid on the bowl, push down in the middle and it pops right on. Nice tight seal. Glad to have nice glass bowls to replace plastic ones. AND they are made in the USA!"
"The reason I use pyrex glassware is because of the products they make and this is no exception! Its leak proof easy to use/clean and very durable. You can actually create a negative suction on the food by pressing the lid in from the center (prevents some bacteria to grow on the food, also if the lid goes back up or bulges out that also tells you the food has gone bad, bacteria produce gas and that's why it bulges)."
"I love Pyrex they are durable, easy to clean and leak proof. I have several of these in different colors shape and sizes. I can freeze, microwave, store and best of all I can see what's inside of them whether its in the fridge or in the freezer. Can't beat that for the price!"
"Lids are tight. Tested in freezer, fridge and fortunately not microwave. Lids can go in, but should not be on tight. They do lots of work in our kitchen as there are only two of us, so leftovers are generally small and they make a one person meal in the microwave or side easy."
"Changing from plastic containers to more glass for safer reheating than plastic. Also these work as acceptable table service bowls  We don‚Äôt use lids in microwave or dishwasher, but occasionally a lid goes bad. Fortunately they are available by themselves.  We also use them in freezer for longer storage"
I love using these. They are definitely easy to clean and the covers fit really well and makes them leak proof. Will definitely buy more. They don‚Äôt break easily either and are made of hard glass. I had dropped one of them from the top fridge by accident and didn‚Äôt break.
"This is the BEST food storage system ever! I have used these for loose tea, hot, cold, dry and liquid foods. I have stored stuff in my freezer with them, and then heated it in the microwave. They make great mixing bowls--like when you make waffle or pancake batter and want to save the rest until later. They do not leak and are very stable. I have a tendency to drop things, and these seem to be able to withstand a lot of mishandling. They are hand washable and dishwasher safe. They clean up easily. The lids do not degrade over time, like other products I have used. They always fit the containers, too. Since the part that holds the food is glass, you don't have to worry about chemicals leaching into your food.  I LOVE these! I was so impressed by these covered bowls, I went and ordered some rectangular containers to match. Throw away those plastic containers (except maybe for storing dry goods or non-food items). These are far superior to Tupperware, Rubbermaid, or anything else on the market."
"I have two of these exact sets now as part of slowly shifting from plastic containers to glass. Glass is much nicer and healthier to use than plastic, and the container sizes in this set are working really well for me.  I use the 7 cup bowl for long-term food storage. The medium 4 cup bowl is good for leftovers and typically goes into the refrigerator. The 2 cup bowl is for a single serving of whatever I don't want to overeat. At first I thought the 2 cup size was useless because it was so small, but now that I'm really working on portion size control, its my favorite.  Some of the reviews on Amazon about Pyrex alerted me that Pyrex is now being made in China. Apparently the new Chinese glass mixture is inferior to the old Pyrex, and as a result people are reporting the ""new"" Pyrex is nowhere near as good as the old Pyrex. So seeing ""Made in the USA"" on the box and listed on the product page here was a relief. If this is the new, ""inferior"" Pyrex, I can't tell the difference.  If you are not a glass convert yet, this is a good set to get started with. As others have mentioned, keep an eye out for price drops and you'll be able to lose that yucky plastic without spending much more than $60-$80."
"We got the glass containers in perfect condition, everything looks good and fits great. I use these mainly for storing baby food and I like these a lot better since they are superior quality and last longer than the cheap plastic containers that my husband likes. DO read the package instructions and also the warning labels under the leads. It clearly says ""NOT for oven use"".  My only comment is the product description is kinda misleading...when they say ""6-pack"", I thought there were actually 6 containers LOL...as my husband pointed out, apparently the lids also each count as one piece so 3 glass containers with 3 lids count as 6 pieces."
"So good I ordered more last night that arrive tomorrow. My only self inflicted problem is that someone here seems to have tossed out one of the lids, probably thinking it was packaging material from a used up product. They do seem flimsy, but work great if no one tosses one out. Oh well, I‚Äôll by a few replacement lids. Great product. I hope they are still US made! Thank you Pyrex!"
"You get 3 of the most useful sizes of Pyrex bowls. They are handy for storage and reheating (altho I would caution against microwaving with the lid on), and durable too. I have other microwave lids that allow steam to escape rather than the ones that come with the bowls."
"I am trying to achieve the dual goal of eating healthier and saving money, meaning that I am bringing lunch to work each day. I usually bring beans and rice or leftover dinner with a side of veggies. These bowls are perfect for that purpose. The medium sized one is just the right size for a lunch portion, and the smaller bowl holds the veggies. They fit neatly in my lunch cooler. I use the bigger one to hold my breakfast oatmeal which I make once a week and reheat in small portions. The glass is microwave-safe, toxic-chemical-free (especially as compared to plastic), and easy to clean off. The lids secure nicely and are durable. Lids need replacing before the glass does usually, but never fear, you can buy those separately. These are pricier than the cheap plastic containers but well worth it for the durability and safety. A great item."
Liked this so much I ordered another set. We are replacing storage in plastic containers with storage in glass containers and these are super easy to use and very good quality. It‚Äôs great that they are microwavable and dishwasher safe as well.
"Love these! Have a few. However, the ones I have are older. I put one in microwave for 3 minutes and lid melted a little. I had to reshape. No biggie. I still prefer these over plastic any day! No stains no odor"
I already have the rectangular Pyrex dishes. I wanted circular ones and these are exactly what I needed. They are great for leftovers and heating them in the microwave. They seal really well. They are the perfect sizes I needed.
"Glass is best! I hate how 'plastic' brands leave a taste in my left-overs. And glass just gets clean easier and more thoroughly. These are not as air-tight as some of the other storage containers on the market but I don't like how the other brands and styles use 'snap-on' lids that are a pain to store and take up too much space in my refrigerator. As I expect to use up any left-overs within a couple days, these are the solution for me."
Love these bowls. Have had a set for years and they‚Äôve worked flawlessly. Bought these after dropping and breaking one bowl after years of use. These are a different tint and the wall thickness is visibly thinner. One bowl also has a visible ripple/flaw that doesn‚Äôt seem to affect it as yet. Lids are handy for refrigerating.
"Very nice quality. Thick glass. The price is great. I like the three different sizes: 2 cups, 4 cups and a jumbo 7 cup size that is perfect for salads or larger amounts of leftovers, or even a perfect glass dog water or food bowl. When they arrived they were too large for what I needed (except the 2 cup size) so I was going to return them and get the all 2 cup size set, but my flatmate liked them so much, he asked to buy them from me. Win win! :) I ordered the smaller set of 2 cups and they are perfect."
"Excellent product in keeping with Pyrex. What I love the most is that they are stackable and save a lot of space. The product speaks for itself, excellent no less."
"This was my sixth order of Pyrex storage items in the past ten months. I now own 44 containers (plus 44 lids) in various sizes from 1 cup to 7 cups. There are always several in the freezer, many in the refrigerator, a handful in the cupboard, a few in the dishwasher and one or two storing bulk ingredients in the pantry. With the clear bowls, refrigerated leftovers are no longer forgotten until it's too late.  If you're purchasing Pyrex storage pieces for the first time this is a great starter set. If you're not sure which size(s) are best for your household, start with this set (one each 2-cup, 4-cup and 7-cup sizes plus lids) and/or the other 6-piece set (one each 1-cup, 2-cup and 4-cup sizes plus lids). Once you use them on a daily basis you'll know which sizes or sets are most useful in your household. I guarantee you'll be ordering more. Start checking the prices every day. One morning you'll log in and the items you need will be at a too-good-to-pass-up price. That's how I've placed each of my six orders. As I result, my 44 containers have averaged $4.72 per bowl+lid set.  These containers have made healthful eating so much easier. In the winter I cook large quantities of vegetable and grain stews and soups in a slow cooker and freeze the leftovers in 1-cup and 2-cup containers. These have totally replaced prepared frozen dinners. With summer in full swing, I wash and tear a head of romaine lettuce that fills the 7-cup size and use a variety of 1- and 2-cup containers for assorted salad vegetables run through the food processor. In well under half an hour I have salad fixings for several days. I can set out a salad bar for lunch or dinner in a minute. No more excuses that I'm too tired or too hungry to start prepping the salad fixings at 6:00 P.M. And it tastes better than if I'd washed and chopped and sliced immediately before eating. All the ingredients are always cool and extra-crisp.  Improved our diet, cut down on disposables, replaced plastics in the microwave, made in USA. What's not to love?"
"I love these! I love the cylindrical shape, the weight of the glass, the flexibility of Pyrex itself, and the fact they are made on America. The sizes are perfect for what I need to store in the fridge. Very happy with this purchase."
"These are wonderful bowls for Dips and such for gatherings. I needed a few more, Pyrex you can always count on for Good Quality & Durability. Glass is always Clean and Fresh on the Table & Island."
"I use this for my animals' food and water. I don't use plastic to eat from or feed my animals. These bowls are great. They clean easy. Can be put in the dishwasher. I pre-portion their breakfast at night and put the lid on and throw it in the fridge. In the morning, it goes straight in the microwave. Easier to deal with. Less dishes to clean. Love these. Have bought a few more Pyrex pieces for storing food. I love that the food can go straight in the container for cooling, as soon as It's done cooking, and the pots and plans can get cleaned up instead of sitting on the stove."
"Love these--I just bought more, but have had a few for years now. I use them for food storage mostly, but they also work for on-the-go tupperware (e.g. lunches). I also love that they hold up well and replacement lids can be purchased separately if need be (though I haven't needed to replace any of my lids, and I put them in the dishwasher top rack). I don't notice them leaking ever, though I would not trust them to hold a soup without leaking when plopped into a work/school bag, since the lid is not locked on. Thanks pyrex!"
Time tested. Just a great product. Lasts forever. Recommended.
"These are just what they say: durable high-quality tempered glass with strong well-fitting plastic lids. I find these superior to the parallel Anchor Hocking storage bowls, which are ok but a little thinner, with slightly less durable lids. Be sure you know what ""6-piece set"" means: 3 bowls (in useful graduated sizes) and 3 lids. Plenty for me but it's not a big set."
I use these in the microwave. No nasty hot plastic. Don't use covers in the microwave. I cover with a paper plate to prevent splatters. Love them. Wish they had a size bigger round dish for cake.
Great price. These glass bowls with lids can be used in the freezer or refrigerator. Dishwasher and Microwave safe. I have 12 of these bowls all different sizes. No kitchen should be without these. Safer to use then plastic.
I have bought these before and needed more sizes. I like to put small portions in the freezer of sauces and take them out as I need so not to cook all the time. I like glass for my food as opposed to plastic. My old one needed a new lid after 6 years and they are easy to purchase on amazon as well Stackable for storage and freezer safe.
"A friend has a set of these and I fell in love with hers so when I saw them for sale here, on Amazon, I just had to order them..... I even ordered 2 sets. They're advertised as storage bowls but they're so much more because they are ovenproof, freezer proof, they can be used in the microwave oven and go right into the dishwasher.... not to mention they are elegant enough to use as serving bowls as well since they are crystal clear straight sided Pyrex. The sets I purchased come in 2 cup, 4 cup and 7 cup size bowls each with its own plastic tight fitting lid. Plastic is okay for some things but you just cannot beat Pyrex glass."
I dropped one on my tile floor and it didn‚Äôt break. They can be used in microwave and store well in refrigerator.
"Purchased as a gift for daughter. Her cabinets were overflowing with mismatched plastic containers with no lids. The pyrex containers stack neater, they don‚Äôt stain and they can go to microwave or freezer with no problem."
"I prepare and freeze soups year-round for my husband's lunches. I have used these same glass storage containers for years, and was always able to purchase the largest one locally in our grocery stores. When no longer available I turned to Amazon as I needed more and want to avoid plastic at all costs for long or short-term storage. I now have 10 of these larger ones - none have cracked or broken when thawing out my soups in the microwave. Lids don't warp either, although I haven't put them in the dishwasher like I do the glass containers. Smaller containers are very useful for leftovers."
I switched to all glass for storing leftovers. I got tired of the plastic Ziploc and Rubbermaid discoloring and scratching and absorbing odors. With these I am comfortable re-heating in the microwave and eating right from the bowl. The lids fit tight and work well in the freezer.
"Can always count on Pyrex! I am using less plastic storage wear, and like that it goes from fridge to oven or microwave."
"My family has been using Corning Pyrex borosilicate glass storage containers for over a decade, and they are the most convenient storage containers I have ever used. Moving on to college life, I decided to purchase a Pyrex storage set, and I have not been let down at all. Despite claims of lower quality products after the licensing of the Pyrex brand by World Kitchen, and the change from borosilicate back to soda lime glass, the durability and reliability of this Pyrex set has surely lived up to the name of Pyrex.  The 2-cup, 4-cup and 7-cup sizes plus lids set is perfect for college dorm life. I occasionally use the 4-cup for regular-sized meals (such as mac & cheese, ramen, spaghetti, etc.) and the 7-cup for larger meals when I'm really hungry, The 2-cup is great for holding small snacks (i.e. nuts, cereal) or just small left-overs. The best thing about using glass storage containers as a college student is that it's so easy to clean and you don't have to worry that the container will remain smelly after holding strong-flavored food (such as curry). (I have a plastic container that is STILL stained pale yellow after holding curry, and you can still sniff a hint of the smell from it.)  All in all, this is a perfect 3-container Pyrex set for any college student."
"I have a complete set of the Pyrex Simply Store but needed a few more serving bowls, so I ordered these. I am just as happy with these as I am with my original set. I have even put leftovers in the freezer in these bowls, however I have never tried to microwave these while still frozen so I do not know if they would tolerate the extreme temperature change....I just put the food in another bowl to reheat or put the food in a pan on the stove."
Great sizes and easy on off tops. Is easy to clean; glad Pyrex sold them in a set like this so the cost was less.
I use these bowls alot and I really like the fact that they are dishwasher friendly.
"Absolutely love this product. Was dithering for a while about whether I wanted the one with the more thoroughly sealed lid. Glad I didn't spend the extra money. Unless you are planning on dumping the container on it's side or upside down this will do the trick. Glass is such a huge improvement over anything plastic or derivative thereof, leaves the food with a much more fresh taste. I especially enjoy cutting up fresh fruits or vegetables in advance and storing them in my fridge until consuming, makes it much easier to incorporate fresh things into my diet."
My main reason for buying this set was for the small dishes. We use them for lunch box heat up meals my lunches from leftovers. But the larger ones are very useful and handy in day to day uses.
"First, it's Pyrex, a name that is synonymous with quality glassware. Second, these a darn useful. Third, there is three of them, in three different sizes. They seal pretty well too when you pop the lid on them. I am a fan and I recommend."
"I actually have my Grandmother‚Äôs Pyrex pie plate with the label embedded in the glass that reads ‚ÄúPatented May 27, 1919‚Äù. How‚Äôs that for durability!"
"I'm a fan of Pyrex, they are great quality and so much better than plastic tupperware. I've had the 2 cup and 4 cup before, which are great for leftovers or work. The 7 cup is the perfect size for a nice big salad, which is what I've been looking for! The 4 cup just doesn't quite cut it for an entree size salad."
"I went with these as my first glass containers, as I was fed up with the disgusting, warped and grease-stained plastic containers I already had in my cupboards. These feel very well-made and are in very convenient sizes. I wish I bought the double set. The largest bowl in this set holds a lot, depending on your portion-sizes, it can hold about 3-5 servings of a main dish. The middle and smallest sized bowls are perfect for bringing leftovers to work or stowing them away neatly in your fridge. I'm very pleased with these containers."
Love these. Works great for anything with tomato in it. Does not stain like ALL brands of plastic containers.
"I bought these bowls mainly for the lids. The cheaper Anchor brand versions on the market Achilles‚Äô heel, is the cheep plastic lid. Pyrex wrote the book on glassware and the plastic on these lasts for years without cracking."
"Very attractive. Solid design. Ridiculously low price. I liked this set so much I've ordered 6 (so far) for my family. The lids seal well and are very easy to place on and remove.  I don't know how well the lids will hold up with repeated heating in a microwave, so I use other lids when heating just to be safe.  The bowels are heavy and can be slippery. You have to be careful and hold them tightly when handling. Use hot mitts - the glass is much hotter than plastic bowls."
"I love these containers. I have been switching over to glass storage with all the questions about which plastic containers are really safe, and I have been delighted with their performance. Food seems to keep fresh longer, no aftertastes, no staining from spaghetti sauce, etc. Everything is dishwasher safe. They stack well for storing and are in convenient sizes. I agree with other reviewers that some of the lids are a bit hard to get on/off at start, but they do get easier with use. I can't think of a single negative comment about them. enjoy!"
"The lids are not as easy as plastic but it just takes different handling; hook on front and push toward far side; to take off, push in center and pull from far side. On first use, wash bowl first with hottish water and while you are washing lid the bowl will have cooled a bit, so it should be a little less expanded that the lid. Also, remember, when you put it in the refrigerator, the air inside will contract creating a slight vacuum. Very nice glass and I like the snug fit of the lids."
These are great bowls. Last forever if you don't drop on.a very hard floor. Lids snap shut and also are very durable. Have had another set for over ten years.
nice set lids fit well and there made well and worked in my oven as well
"I, like so many others, have spent years and bunches of money on disposable storage containers. After my kitchen remodel, I just knew I had to find a better way as I had a box full of plastics, some missing lids, nothing fitting together well. I ordered 2 sets of these and is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Each size has a purpose and seems to fit our leftovers perfect. Other pieces fit best for taking my lunch to work. I store with the lids on and can microwave food without staining or melting the inside. And yes, I threw out every bit of plastic food storage in my house."
I love these they are the perfect size
"Can't wait to make my chicken salad in the large bowl and then just slide on the cover, put it in the fridge, and eat later. One bowl prep and use. And of course Pyrex speaks for itself."
Great for keeping pastries fresh. Very well made and easy to clean.
Microwave safe bowls perfect for cooking a side vegetable. The smaller one can be used to pack lunch. Nice lids.
"This was a gift to my daughter to replace old plastic containers. Really easy to clean, and does not leak."
Can go right into microwave with leftovers. Can see what‚Äôs in the container.
"These are great storage bowls. I like this set of sizes, although everyone will have a different idea about how big storage should be. The lids are firm although not so tight that you could turn them upside down. However, they serve their purpose well and I am gad to get away from plastic containers. I also have some of the rectangular ones and I use those as well. I initially purchased another set and returned to buy these. Would definitely recommend."
"Great product, This comes in three handy sizes. We looked hard to find USA made and this is it!. The plastic tops are made in China. The glass bottoms made in the USA. Great product."
Leakproof keeps lunch secure
"Nice set of 3 pyrex food containers with lids. It's healthier to not use plastic so I've been replacing mine a little at a time. Most of the ones I have are the size of the middle one so it was nice to get a larger and smaller one too. These are perfect for storing leftovers in the refrigerator and also heating up food in the microwave, although you must remove the plastic top."
"Quality product - I love that I can use these in the oven, the microwave, fridge, and freezer. I always reach for these before any plastic storage because it makes reheating and washing simpler. I have had my first set for 4 years (bought more because they are awesome) and haven't had any issues with lids. The large size is usually the perfect size for leftovers, while the smallest is a good one portion size."
Great for leftovers. Easy to clean.
"You can use them to store leftovers in the refrigertor and then reheat them in the same bowl.  When you only want to use part of the contents, you can use one of the smaller bowls for reheating and store the remainer -- until it will fit in a smaller bowl -- back in the refrigerator.  Get a set: you'll appreciate having three sizes fot the flwxibility that provide.  AND, they cost a LOT less in this seet than separatley elsewhere."
Excellent Pyrex bowls. Better than any other bowl for heating in microwave.
I swear by these things and use them every single day. Word to the wise - do not wash plastic lids in dishwasher. I tried in top-of- rack and they all shrunk. So I always wash lids by hand in soapy water. Works every time...  Kevin____
"After reading the negative reviews I felt compelled to add this: First the rubber ring is removable so that it can be cleaned. You see there are these things called bacteria, and they can get into tight spaces, so you need to remove the ring to actually clean under and around them! Second, I find it interesting that all the pictures of the broken rings suspiciously look as if they were cut by a sharp object. Competition reviews?  For the record, I am reviewing ""Glass Meal Prep Containers, [10 Pack] Glass Food Storage Containers with Lids, Airtight Glass Bento Boxes, BPA Free & Leak Proof (10 Lids & 10 Containers)"" Blue to be specific. I know that sometimes reviews get mismatched and used under other products so this should help.  I bought these to use in the portable electric oven ( Portable Oven, 110V Portable Food Warmer Personal Portable Oven Mini Electric Heated Lunch Box for Reheating & Raw Food Cooking in Office, Travel, Potlucks and Home Kitchen (Black)) that I purchased for my husband to use at work to heat his lunches so that he did not have to have cold meals all the time. I got these ones because the bottoms are flat and sit on the heating plate properly  My concern was that with this type of container the lids usually warp or degrade rather quickly. But that is not the case with these so far. We have been using them for several months, five days a week. I can say with confidence that they are hardy, easy to clean, and work really well. I have had one that leaked when I put in a large amount of soup. but I found that if I cover the container with plastic wrap before putting on the lid that takes care of it. I do that anyway whenever I have a tomato based meal so that it wont stain the lid. Not that it has. As a matter of fact the lids have maintained their Like New condition so far and I am very happy. The lids are thick plastic. I told my husband to loosen the lids when he places the meal in the oven so that there is no build up of steam or pressure and that way it would not deform them. But I have to admit I think I am being overly cautious. I don't like spending money and ruining things then having to buy more. I am very happy with my purchase. They arrived on time, work better than I expected, and are holding up really well. I highly recommend them. I just wish I could buy more of the 12 oz size ones by themselves. I need more of them and that option is not available."
"Products came individually wrapped and at first I loved these containers. After putting them together and storing them until use I came to realize the defect that continued to happen. Every large container in the set which is 5 the seals got stuck onto the glass before even using. Taking out of storage to use one I noticed immediately the problem, and checked each container and only the larger ones did this. The seal would get stuck to the glass but the lid would still come off leaving behind the stuck on color seal. Trying to remove the seal causes tears and or rips due to the severity of them being so stuck. Was very impressed with the look of these dishes but the durability of them are very low"
"The containers were absolutely beautiful upon opening the box. The color is to die for and the glass is nice and sturdy. However.....one day into using one container (the others are still in the box), the rubber seal is breaking from the base. There‚Äôs no way to secure it back on, so I‚Äôm down one container already. My lunch consisted of only a salad and my was container was secured in my lunch bag. There‚Äôs no way the container can be saved as the lock mechanism will not function properly and it‚Äôll be prone to leaks. It‚Äôs very disappointing seeing as though the containers looked so promising online and upon first impression."
First of all I was surprised just how heavy the box was when it came in. This is THICK glass. I‚Äôve been using them for over a week and have been loving them. Perfect sizes and the lids snap on easily. Will buy another set in the future.
"I've been using these fairly regularly for the last month. General use - storing leftovers in the refrigerator & reheating. The rubber seals that (I'm assuming) are supposed to stay attached to the lids almost always get stuck to the glass containers. Generally not an issue, I'd just pull it off and put it back inside the lid. I always remove rubber seal prior putting in the dishwasher or microwave. This morning the rubber seal ripped into several pieces when I attempted to remove from the glass container. Super bummed. I still have the other ones intact - HOPING this one was a fluke, but my feeling is they won't be far behind. Without the rubber piece, the lid won't seal properly. This was not due to mishandling these - I'll still get good use out of the glass dish, but wish as a whole unit it would've held up better.  **edit - 2 more of the seals have broken since my initial review. If you're looking for glass tupperware WITH lids that seal closed, I would look elsewhere."
"I already had a set of glass meal prep containers and decided to get this set to have a variety of sizes. This set just doesn't compare in any way to my other set. Two of the lids were cracked or broken when the set arrived. A day later a dish slipped out of the fridge (they slide easily when stacked) and fell to the rug on the floor... about a 2 foot drop... and shattered. And even if you're super careful with them, the inner silicone gasket comes off EVERY single time you open the container, and you have to hand wash the silicone bits, because they shrink in the dishwasher and you can't get them back on. Just super frustrating and felt like a waste of money."
"I ordered two sets of five large and five small glass containers for meal prep. The shipping was fast, and the containers were well packaged. On inspection, I noticed that four of the large lids had hairline cracks near the clips. I e-mailed the company using the address provided on a warrantee card included in the box. I was contacted within 12 hours, and after providing an order number, a new set of five large containers and lids was dispatched. I used a few of the containers to freeze a batch of pork chops. Three pork chops fit in the large container. It could probably fit four if needed. The clips were strong and not difficult to use at all. I like that the silicone ring in the lid comes out so it can be washed if food gets behind it. So far very pleased with the product and the company‚Äôs service."
I don't know why this has so many 5 star reviews because they aren't durable at all. The plastic seal is removable and fall off easy which is incredibly annoying and just more pieces I have to make sure don't get lost. Now after just one use and not even ran through the dishwasher all the plastic seals are breaking making them not air tight and useless for what I need them for.
"I purchased these after reading all of the comments about the seals because I think people fail to realize that it clearly states in the information that the seals are removable for easier clean! Which I love because it keeps everything in the container while it is closed but when I clean the container afterwards i know the seal comes off and on easily when it is not sealed so I may wash and clean properly. I have had so many issues with not being able to clean lids in the area that has the seal and end up throwing them away after time because ultimately there gets buildup under the non removable seals. With that being said I am very happy with this purchase especially since it came with a lifetime warranty for absolutely ANY issue I have with the seal, glass, lid, or even if it leaks through the seal they guarentee a free replacement. So honestly this was the best, most logical purchase I have ever made with containers. I work in the medical health field and I cannot tell you how much bacteria is under those non removable seals overtime! So if I have to replace a seal for FREE of charge and guarantee it's for the exact same container then I will do so rather than buying new containers continuously over time."
""
These are perfect! The people who said they ‚Äúfell apart‚Äù because the rubber seal came off are so dumb lol they are SUPPOSED to come off so you can clean them. They are super easy to put back on and still prevent leaks!
"These are great, I purchased my first set in 2019 and just bought a second because I had broken one and wanted a full week. I meal prep in them every week and carry them back and forth to school and work. They‚Äôre great in the microwave and I‚Äôve had no issues with the seals like other reviewers have reported. They‚Äôre the best containers and it makes my neurotic heart happy to have them all lined up and matching in the cabinet. I had other glass meal prep containers before these which cost $20 more and that only lasted six months. These have lasted two years besides the one I broke, that being said they‚Äôre pretty durable and they‚Äôve had many bumps and drops over year and have sustained little to no damage. The one that I broke was just a pretty high fall and a hard counter. They go through the dishwasher weekly and there have been no chips or damage to the lids. I had one snap break a little but it hasn‚Äôt affected the function of the lid but honestly when you use something every week you expect a little wear and tear. I highly recently these!"
"They were great until the edges stared to chip away. I bought these in hopes they could last me a while. When they first arrived, the glass seemed to be durable (as much as glass can be), I hand washed them, and started using them immediately for meal prep. I‚Äôve only had them maybe 2 months, but within a couple of weeks the edges were chipping off, and it would slice my fingers or hand open. That‚Äôs not ok! I maybe have 2 containers left now out of the 10 I received. I think the quality is poor and faulty. I would not recommend! Spend the money on a better brand!"
"I bought these for my husband to take to work with him. He likes them so much that he uses them for everything. Is it necessary to put a sandwich in these when a regular disposable sandwich bag will do? Probably not. But hey my husband is going to do it anyway. The frequency of which these get used means that I constantly see these sitting in my sink. I finish the dishes and boom. There is another one. It never ends. I‚Äôm forever washing them. I see them in my dreams now. So yes they do their job wonderfully, but I‚Äôm so tired of having to wash them all the time. My only solace is that they wipe off easily enough."
"I‚Äôve been using these glass containers for 9 months without any issues. The rubber seals have not broken. None of the containers themselves have shattered and they‚Äôve been put to the test bouncing around in the floor board of the car (daily lunches/snacks). I use them in the dish washer and scold them. The lids have kept their form, and have not cracked.  Back again to buy more actually.  I‚Äôve been very pleased and know these have been reliable.  Happy spending."
"I can understand why other reviewers would be frustrated with the gaskets breaking but my partner owned a set of these containers before I just bought more and let me tell you; this man isn‚Äôt the best at tidying up or following directions so he definitely put these containers through the ringer and they held up wonderfully! The gasket comes out sometimes BUT, depending on what you‚Äôre storing in them, you‚Äôd want them to come out so you can clean them anyway. The packaging is very thorough to ensure they arrive in their best condition and I also love that I can re-heat food right in the oven without having to dirty a pan or tray (especially since we don‚Äôt use a microwave)."
"Was switching from plastic to glass and wanted spill proof boxes. These definitely meet those requirements.  Positives: 1. As listed, the rubber seal comes off for easy cleaning. 2. Lids lock tight and are easy to snap shut and open. 3. I have put them in the fridge, freezer and microwave and they do just fine. However, I was careful not to put them straight from the freezer into the microwave without letting it thaw out on the counter. May be they would do fine but I don‚Äôt want to risk it.  A few negatives: 1. The boxes kind of stack but they aren‚Äôt tapered enough to stack fully. 2. The plastic covers will start to get scratched over time especially if you tend to hand wash a lot like I do. 3. Unfortunately the box and the entire fridge tends to stink up if you put something like chopped onions or garlic in them. Not sure why they leak out odors."
"I'm in awe that I paid this great price for a set of excellent quality pyrex glass containers, they are solid! and the set came packed perfectly, not one scratch and I love all the different colors and the way they look, I'm not planning on storing liquids in these containers so I'm not sure if they are completely spill proof, but the last time I stored chicken noodle soup in the fridge in one of these, it never spilled or dripped anything. They are also very easy to wash as they have no corners and you can take it all apart for a good cleaning if needed. Fantastic product!! I'm so happy with this purchase :)"
"I received them quickly, well packaged, all were intact, no flaws whatsoever. The large ones are very good for storing larger left-over quantities, and the small ones for smaller quantities such as left-over tomato sauce from cooking etc. I wash all parts by hand as I prefer handwashing to dishwasher, so I have not tried them in the dishwasher, but when handwashing, they look like new after washing. I like the different lid colors , which is helpful to keep track of what is stored in which container. I also like how easy it is to stack them in the fridge - saves space. I have not tried them in the freezer yet, but I have a similar set that I have used to store homemade ice cream, and plan to use these the same way. I will update this review if there is an issue with freezing, but at this time I do not anticipated it. In summary, I am very pleased!"
I would definitely get these again. I wait to use for a bit before I reviewed. Very sturdy and leak proof. The lids should be washed with warm soapy water sooner to remove food smells that are stronger. (Stored curry! )
"I purchased these because I wanted to get rid of all of our Tupperware and just replace with glass food storage containers instead! I‚Äôm sooo glad I did! First, having this with the kids on them keeps our cabinet organized, the way the top and the container fit together really does a great job at keeping things fresh! They are dishwasher safe (I put my tops on the top rack and the glass container on the bottom rack) and they come out looking brand new! We use them for leftovers and for storage when we buy fruit and need to place it in a container after we‚Äôve cleaned the fruit off and cut the fruit up! You won‚Äôt regret this purchase!"
"We love these containers. First, they are square and stackable. Therefore, they save room in the cupboard and in the refrigerator. The interchangeable tops click into place and efficiently seal. The glass is heavy and of good quality. Therefore, you can see the contents and pop them into the microwave without worry. These are so superior over plastic containers that are opaque, can get stained by food, and may contaminate food in the microwave. My only suggestion is that the company should make an intermediate size between the smaller and larger containers."
"The value is definitely there. These are heavy weight, can be microwaved, long lasting unlike plastic meal prep containers, and I love that you get five large. I ordered 3 sets (orange, blue, green) and I was not disappointed. I worried about them being broke because there was no foam, just a box inside a box, but they were all in perfect condition. I feel these will last a long time, I do hope tho they start selling lid replacements separately because that is the only part is could see damaging easier. The mini ones are great for sauces, snacks, desserts, or if you're someone who likes smaller meals or needs smaller portion containers (bariatric surgery). Very very happy with my purchase."
I like the fact that the seals come out so I can wash them thoroughly along with the inner lining where the seals go. It's important to remember that the flat size goes back down the round curve side stays out. They stack nicely in my refrigerator. The manufacturer suggests that you don't wash the lids in the washing machine however I do on the top shelf. I wash them without the seals in them. I haven't had a problem. I wish I could order these exact same ones in a little larger size.
"Fantastic food storage and I love how they are made from borosilicate glass so you can bake with them. I've had them for about 2 months and they are a life saver in storing leftovers and making small casseroles in the oven. I hand wash them (easy enough to clean) so I can't speak for how they hold up in the dishwasher, but I feel like they'd be fine. I love how the lids can stack into each other (there's a groove around the top so each on sits squarely on the next) and the glass can also stack as well. The two sizes also work well for my needs.  I do wish the plastic lids were a little more sturdy as I feel like the clasps might snap off easily, but so far I have not had any problems with them. Just make sure the lid is squarely on the container before snapping it into place. They are leakproof as well and I have used the containers to make pickles and other dishes that have a lot of liquid content without worry. I have found that if you seal hot food in the containers and let them cool in the refrigerator the lids will cave in due to the vacuum created, but it hasn't caused any issues for me. I always take the lids off to microwave just to be safe, but they are supposed to be microwave safe and I haven't seen any indication that they aren't; you probably just want to make sure the lids are not sealed on when heating (unclasp and make sure the seal isn't sucking the lid closed)."
"After reading other reviews about issues with the seal, I was skeptical, but decided to give these a try anyway. I have been using them for 2 weeks now to meal prep and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I haven‚Äôt been putting the lids in the microwave or dishwasher tho. Only the glass container. I will update if I have issues. They are the perfect size for my breakfast and lunch!!"
"Love this set. The glass is thick, and the colorful lids are cute. I have read some complaints about the durability of the lids. The lids are fine, but there are some rules you must follow to keep from damaging them: Never microwave the lids. They will soften, or even melt, and the hey will never work right again. After freezing food, always run some room-temperature over the lid for about 15 seconds before attempting to remove the lid. Never pull on the lid tabs to remove the lids. Instead, pull up on the rounded corners. If you follow these simple rules, the lids will last for a long time."
"I purchased the pink set for myself and loved them so much that I bought the colorful set for my mom! The glass has a nice thickness to it, making these high quality. I have run them through my dishwasher and they came out beautifully! Used the small container for homemade ranch dressing, shook it around to mix it up and there was not a leak in site. Highly recommend if you are the search for glass storage containers."
These glass containers are surprisingly light weight and excellent quality. They're perfect sizes for my meal prep.
I absolutely love these I‚Äôd say they are medium and small size I use them for some left overs and my husbands lunch. The rubber seal comes off which I absolutely love you can clean the whole lid without worrying about hunk stuck in crevices. I personally hand wash the lids and liner and put the glass dish in the dishwasher. For the price it‚Äôs a good buy it looks like I spent money $$ on these but for this whole set I‚Äôd find it at kohl‚Äôs or Macy‚Äôs 3x the price
"I had been using the cheaper plastic containers, but just moved into a new apartment with a nice kitchen (and without a messy roommate) and decided to upgrade my meal prep. Several of the lid liners came off and popped back in just as easily, so I honestly assumed that was by design but other reviews have mentioned this as a significant issue. The squared end fits back into the lid, the round end makes contact with the glass container, and all I can see holding the liner in place is a ridge in the rubber. I've had no issues with the liners tearing or becoming unusable.  Edit: The image at the bottom describes the lid liners as detachable.  Otherwise, they worked as advertised: seal was tight and they have survived the freezer and the microwave so far. Very satisfied with the product and price overall."
"I really enjoy how tight these containers are. Really keep food locked in and spill proof. Great portion sizes for leftovers and easy to stack in the fridge.  The one thing I like/dislike is the rubber seal - comes off easily, but this also makes them easy to clean. No problem getting the seal back in.  I've had other containers and these ones definitely get the job done. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice matching set."
I am pleased with my purchase. I use these for storage containers. You can heat up your food because the bottom is glass. I no longer use plastic containers to store food. I do however use plastic containers to send food home with guests. I‚Äôm not sure if they are dishwasher safe but I wash them on the top rack of dishwasher and they are not damaged. They are worth the money. I like the variety of colors they come in as well.
Great product! Seals great and product seems to be quality made. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars on cleaning is I‚Äôm lazy and want everything to go into the dishwasher. It is recommended the lids to be hand washed. Other than that it‚Äôs a 5 star product across the board. When I received the package one of the smaller containers was broken. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond with a small refund instead of replacement do to out of stock item. Quick and no hassles! I would highly recommend purchase of this item.
"I love these! The colors are super cute and vibrant. I haven‚Äôt attempted to tip them over to see if they‚Äôre completely leak proof, but so far I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I like that there are 2 sizes so the smaller one fits in the bigger one- makes for easier storage. The only thing that makes me nervous is that I haven‚Äôt tried to clean the lids in the dish washer (I put the glass part in there and it cleans it well!) and you have to hand wash the colored rubber, which I don‚Äôt like because I‚Äôm lazy! Overall, they were a great purchase."
"These little containers are adorable! I didnt realize how small the smaller size of the two would be, but that's my inability it conceptualize measurements lol. But seriously, the package came EXTREMELY protected. The little containers and respective lids were nestled into the larger containers, with a piece of foam dividing them to they wouldn't clank or break in transit. The larger ones themselves were nestled into a styrofoam tray. Arrived completely intact!"
"Sizes are great and I love that you can store the little ones in the big ones. Dishwasher cleans them well, though I typically wash the lids by hand because I worry they might warp over time, but so far they are awesome. I‚Äôve stored sauces in them with no leakage issues."
"I would expect these containers to cost at least twice as much. They were shipped quickly and securely packed. Each lid had two layers of plastic film for protection, one on each side. They each had a descriptive insert suitable for gift giving. I have no intention of breaking up the set since I am going to use them for meal prep. They are the perfect sizes and I like the way they lock securely. The pink color is lovely too. I am very happy with my purchase!"
"These are exactly what we were looking for to replace our cheap plastic tupperware. The glass is nice and durable. They are a great size and do a perfect job at sealing in any liquid left overs. A lot of reviews are complaining about the seals coming out, but if you look closely at the lids (pictured) there is a small dip in the boarder along the seals. This tells me they are SUPPOSED to come out. This makes it possible to thoroughly clean the lids. It's a little more work, but I'd rather do that than have a seal that doesn't come out where food could be getting stuck inside of and making things nasty. I would definitely recommend these."
"Switched to glass and tossed the plastic storage pieces. Great for butter, leftovers and potluck dinners with friends. I always take the pink so I get my container back with no confusion - so the multiple colors are helpful. They seal well - again a great cheese or butter storage device."
"I bought a set of pink for myself and a set of blue for my husband and we love them! They're the perfect size for meal prepping. I threw all my other regular plastic ones away because these are way more durable, being glass and all, and WAAAYYYY easier to clean. I hate cleaning the plastic one because of all the edges and nooks and crannies food can get into. These don't have that problem. I'll definitely be buying more when I can."
"Big fan. I attempt meal prep here and there and these are ideal for proper size meals. The black plastic ""meal prep"" containers on Amazon barely last longer than Chinese take out boxes, but these glass containers are robust and seal tightly. The removable gasket in the lid is a double edged sword; makes thorough cleaning easier but occasionally it moves and makes the seal less than ideal. Just pay attention when clamping the lid down."
"This glass food storage set is wonderful. They are perfectly sized for individual servings and storing everything from salads to deserts. They also make reheating a snap. Not only am I saving a fortune by not purchasing grocery store Tupperware, I don‚Äôt have to devote an entire cabinet to store all of the half melted, tomato stained, mismatched stragglers. And the biggest plus is not searching for a lid that fits. After I take them out of the dishwasher I let the lids air dry for a couple of hours and then snap them all back together and stack them up to be stored on a pantry shelf. Go ahead, gift yourself!"
"These glass contains are great for these reasons: 1. The size of the larger containers is the perfect size if you ask me. The smaller containers are perfect for prepping smaller meals or snacks. 2. The price for these containers for the quantity you get is one of the best on Amazon. 3. Microwave-safe (not the cover/lid), Oven-safe (just dont shock the glass by putting a cold bowl into an already superheated oven), and leak-proof!  I might order some more. But definitely a great purchase"
"These have been great for meal prep, and we like that you can reheat the food in the container without wrecking it (unlike plastic containers!). They're easy to clean, don't seem to leach any flavor into the food and the food doesn't stain them, etc. Overall would purchase again!"
"So glad I made the switch from plastic containers. The lids fit nice and tight and I have no worries about them leaking. I have chosen to always handwash the lids to ensure they 1) don't pick up the smell of the dishwasher detergent and 2) don't become warped. Assuming you don't make a huge mess, they are easy enough to clean by hand. It's great to be able to toss containers themselves right in the dishwasher without that worry--much better than the plastic I used to have!"
Product was well packaged and does what I want it too. One thing that always drives me nuts with these sealing lids is super small grooves that are impossible to clean out. These have a larger lip and gap and I am able to get a sponge or scrubbie down inside without much effort if needed. Will be buying more.
This is my second time buying them because I love them that much! They are absolutely leak proof and so easy to clean (I recommend only hand washing the lids). They are stackable which saves a lot of space. I use one set for everyday fridge storage and the other set for my meal prepping. Love that I can pop it in the oven!
I am so glad I discovered these great containers. I love that I can store my leftovers in them and pop them in the microwave or the oven later to heat them back up again. I'm throwing out my plastic GLAD containers. The lids are so much easier to remove also. Best purchase I've made from Amazon Prime Days.
I was hesitant to purchase these without physically seeing them but they are fabulous and a terrific deal !! Packaged awesome too so not 1 would break ! Great sizes for meal prep or leftovers ! Super lids . Don‚Äôt hesitate to get these !
"I use these to prepare multi-portion meals ahead of time. I can whip up a triple portion of meatloaf, use the glass dished on a cookie sheet in the oven, after cooling place the snap-on lids and then freeze until the day before I need. Even when thawed, I am heating separately an individual portion, replacing the lid and returning to refrigerator. They clean up very well."
I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase. I‚Äôve had my set for months now and I use the containers almost every single day. Perfect for brining lunch in to work or taking on a picnic. The glass wall is thick and durable. It is microwave safe but I recommend microwaving without the plastic lid on.
Can‚Äôt beat the quality for the price. And the color options are super cute! I did receive one that was shattered and contacted the seller - they were out of stock of the piece that was broken so they offered me a partial refund. Timely response and an adequate resolution. Will definitely purchase again!
These containers hold just the right amount of food to take to work for lunch. They are microwavable ( without the lid) and clean up is a breeze. I do wish they came with double the amount of larger containers and none of the smaller ones then I think the price would be ok. As is the price is a little steep.

"I haven't had these very long but so far they are well worth the money spent. My plastic containers were not very old but chipped and split. These are air tight, great for storing vegetables, main dishes and great for the freezer. They clean up easy and I love the lids, no leaks."
"I love these containers so much. I‚Äôm about to buy more because everytime I send friends good in these they never come back! They are very heavy and solid, they are leaked proof and don‚Äôt stain. I‚Äôve baked in them, frozen them and put in the dish washer with no issues! Love these!"
"These are GREAT! I typically prepare my lunches for the week ahead of time. These containers make that very easy. I can bake mini casseroles in the oven, or plate an entire meal in a single dish, and easily warm them in the microwave at work. The lids are very good, and even when I place the dishes sideways in my lunchbox, I've never had a leak! I also like that they can just go into the dishwasher for cleaning up."
"I love these containers, they are the perfect sizes for my use, but you need to be careful stacking them. The glass bottoms don't nest very well with the tops and can slip if you are trying to put several into freezer or refrigerator."
I love the easy cleanup of glass. it is SO much better than those infernal plastic storage containers. These containers can be put in the microwave and the freezer and the dishwasher. They're just perfect for all of those modern kitchen appliances. The lids are much easier to use for my arthritic hands than the typical lids that come with plastic containers. i plan to buy more of these.
"I wanted something that could go in the freezer, toaster oven, and microwave easily, and these fit the bill exactly. The lids lock on tightly. The dishes stack neatly. I tossed the plastic containers!"
"I wanted to switch from plastic to glass containers. I so far love these. One did arrive broken (shipping personnel aren‚Äôt always the best) I reached out to the seller and they responded right away. Unfortunately the one container that broke wasn‚Äôt available so they offered me a refund for the one and didn‚Äôt have me send them all back. I don‚Äôt mind that I lost one, it was a small one anyway. But overall very pleased with them as well as the seller for being kind and helpful when one came broken!"
Yeah~~~ the containers are leak proof and very easy to clean because the elastic band around the lid comes off easily. You can wash the hidden area very throughly. The glass quality is excellent and very durable. It is freezable and microwaveable. Very convenient and awesome to be handy!!! Love them!!!
These containers are well worth the money. They came safely packaged. I love that the small one nests inside the larger one. Such a space saver. The snap is durable and fits very snug. The glass is thick. I definitely recommend.
I do meal prepping and have been for almost a year now. I have been using large plastic containers and finally caved in and bought these glass beauties. I was worried that the larger container wouldn't be big enough but it has plenty of room. It helps with portion control as well. They have been packed to rim with the lid securely on and I have not had one leak yet. I have had them for about 3 months now and love them. The cute colorful lids are a plus.
I bought a set for myself and another for my mom. We both love them. Colors are pretty and the containers themselves are good quality. I‚Äôve used them for about two months and haven‚Äôt had any leaks or cracks. Really happy with them!
"These glass containers are awesome. Perfect size. Thick glass. Durable lids. For the price, they‚Äôre not bad at all. I love them. I got the pink ones and they‚Äôre so cute. Highly recommend!!"
I bought these glass food containers because they are much better and safer to use than plastic food containers. No need to worry about BPA. These glass containers are just the perfect size for food storage. They are stackable and easy to organize with different color lids. The glass containers are microwavable and dishwasher-proof. What more can you ask for.
i love that this set comes with 2 sizes because i use them for my husbands lunch and snack. i love the removable silicone band that makes the leak proof because i can just run it through the dishwasher without worrying about mold growing in between. the sizes are perfect and would definitely repurchase for leftovers!
"Don‚Äôt usually volunteer to leave a review but these are awesome. Heavy duty, sealed perfectly and can hold good amount of food. Mi love dem bad bad."
"I've had these containers for several months now, and let me just say that they are fantastic. They came incredibly well packaged, with each and every piece lovingly cradled in foam or bubble wrap. The hinged lids are very nice- they don't wear and break the way that some other snapware does. I can confirm, as well, that these are oven safe. I've been baking in them for months with no issues whatsoever.  The best part about these is that they are absolutely, without a doubt, 100% leakproof. I can pack a bowl of leftover soup for lunch and throw it in my backpack with my books and laptop with absolute confidence, which is high praise indeed.  I saw some other reviewers complaining about the rubber gaskets, saying that they have a tendency to fall out when removing the lids. This is true- the rubber gaskets are meant to be easily removable so that you can quickly and easily clean them. I've had snapware with non-removable seals and it is a nightmare to clean, impossible to do thoroughly. These come out easily and can be hand washed or run through the dishwasher, easy peasy, and then are easy to replace into the lids. I see this as a benefit, not a defect, of these containers.  Basically, you would be hard pressed to find better food storage. You could buy plastic containers, but they aren't much cheaper and these don't get the dreaded spaghetti stains, and they don't leech poison into your food. Plus, you can bake in these!"
"I have never been so impressed with the care given to a product like this.  The lids have true hinges. The other sets I have all have a one piece molded plastic flexible hinge actually a part of the lid, which stresses and can crack and break. I have had a few lids with these one-piece molded hinges from other manufacturers, which have broken on me. No such worries with these lids.  The lids have a nice tacky surface which allows containers stacked on top to ""grab"" the lid below and not slip-slide around. All my other sets have smooth, slippery plastic lids which have led to some close calls when stacked. Very impressed with the choice to use a tacky, grippy surface here. Lids fit well and securely on the containers.  The containers themselves look perfect. These are generally smaller than the sets I already have (which have some very large pieces) and just what I needed. The glass is thick enough, and the bottom of each piece has a ripple pattern distinctive of borosilicate glass.  The attention to detail in the retail preparation and presentation of this product is exceptional.  When I opened the retail box, I found the product was double boxed. Inside, there were multiple layers of protection for each piece.  Each lid had a protective plastic film covering it. Between each lid and container was another protective plastic sheet. The pieces were packed side by side in four layers. Each layer had a nice foam protective sheet above and below it. If two pieces were nested, there was a protective foam sheet between them. Some had protective foam or cardbord around them, and some were in a bubble wrap envelope.  All in all, the quality of this product is exceptional.  This appears to be one of the very best purchases, especially for the price point of under $40, I have ever made on Amazon."
Can I just say you make it easier for me to live with arthritis!!! It has been very painful to try to remove airtight lids from their containers. And often the struggle ends up on the floor! I love the glass and the easy open lids!! Thanks so much!!
"Our doctor told us there is not really a safe plastic for food storage, to use glass. These containers are very nice. Pay attention to the sizes, they aren't big. But largest is big enough for a casserole for 2. They do freeze, go to the oven and microwave and the lids have hinges instead of attaching with plastic which will break off over time. Very pleased with these. Cleaned up the 'Tupperware' cupboard which now houses these as well as all the pots in pans where there was just a whole lot of containers and mismatched lids stuffed in a pretty unusable mess. And we can't put anymore in our standard sized fridge than what fits in these. We don't need all the rest."
"High quality glass containers! I am throwing out my old plastic containers after hearing about how bad plastic is, even if it's BPA free. These are durable and I like the way the hinges are designed. I heard of people having their hinges break on different brands of glassware, but these are not attached by a flimsy piece of plastic like other hinges are. I'm very happy with the price and quality!"
"Heavy glass and seem durable. They don't all nest together. Like, they nest into 3 or 4 stacks. (Can't remember exactly.)  I bought these primarily because they were some of the few that nested at all and the lids were dishwasher safe. Major bonus in my book.  I wish they were bigger, but I didn't pay too much attention on size. Either way, I'm happy so far! I will update if I have any issues!"
Being able to stack is a huge plus for these. The lids go on nicely and seem very sturdy. I received these faster than I was told they would come so nice service and nice packaging job!
"After doing extensive research on glass bowls with snap lids, I ultimately selected these because the lids could be microwaved and put into the dishwasher. And these had very high reviews. So far they have survived the dishwasher and the bowls have handled microwaving well. The glass is very thick. Pleased so far!"
I‚Äôm very excited about my containers. I tried one while borrowing from a neighbor and decided to order my set. They‚Äôre the perfect size for any everyday meal storage or short week meal prep which I prefer. Sturdy and I like the lid style
""
Very high-quality glass storage containers this is a Great set this is very easy to clean it is very durable it is also leak proof so you do not have to worry about if the dish ever falls over you do not have to worry about your food going all over the floor highly recommended for anybody‚Äôs looking for a nice glass container store set
"I just had these containers for a short time, but I can say, that I am very happy with them so far. The lids snap into place and stay closed, not like with other containers I had before. Another thing that is worth mentioning is, that the packaging really impressed me. Everything was wrapped really well, nothing was broken. I can definitely recommend this product!"
"After using them for several weeks, I‚Äôm Impressed by heaviness of glass containers, which means they‚Äôre not easily broken. Also, the lids have gaskets and hinged snaps that lock really tightly to the container so there‚Äôs no leakage. Perfect replacement for my plastic storage containers."
"I've been wanting to replace my plastic storage containers for a long time and after updating my kitchen I decided to make the move. These containers had great reviews so I ordered them and I am not disappointed. Easy to close and store, and easy to clean, I highly recommend."
Love the red lids. I just threw away all my plastic containers. These ones stack very nicely and take less space. I'm impressed with the quality af these containers. Also appreciate the companies social involvement in the community by donating proceeds of every sale. Will let my family and friends to buy these!
"Very useful in the kitchen. Store leftovers, freeze, reheat, serve and it sure cuts down on switching containers to heat and serve as I did when I used plastic. Note: make sure to wipe off tops of containers when replacing the cover for storing food in refrigerator or freezer, else the gasket may stick and loosen when the container is opened the next time."
"Ive switched all my plastic bowls for glass bowls, they are easier to clean and overall safer to use. I like that they will also send a free product when your register your product within 7 days and also add a 1 yr warranty. I will update weather it is true or not."
"Received containers today, and the packaging was superb. Padded and cushioned, all intact. We love the larger silicone seals that are easily removed for cleaning and won't allow mold to grow like some others we've tried. Great price for borosilicate glass."
"Overall a pretty great product! We can put it in the oven or microwave as long as the lid is off. One circular dish did get a chip in the lip, but we are also VERY aggressive with out dishes so for it to only be a chip and not the whole bowl shattered is a testament in itself! Lol"
"These glass containers are exactly what i have been looking for! They will last longer and clean better than plastic. And, the red lids match my kitchen! The glass dishes are sturdy and appear to be made to last. The lids lock and seal tightly. I'm very pleased with my purchase!"
"I like them a lot! The lids seal well, open and close easily, and are hinged so they are less likely to break. The only thing I wish is that some of the smaller ones were taller so that things like onions would fit. I make it work by slicing the onion or apple, etc. in half."
""
OMG. Stop no need to look any further just scroll right back to the top and add these amazing containers to your cart. I'm in love with the quality of the glass the colors are bright and the tops are amazingly great no leakage.
We have a very big problem in our family we have four households that live within a football field of each other and everyone has the same dishes because we all shop at the same two stores. I will no longer have to fight to get my containers back because they are finally different and better!
Wanted to get rid of the plastic saver containers. Perfect solution! Sturdy too!
"High quality glass containers! I am throwing out my old plastic containers after hearing about how bad plastic is, even if it's BPA free.

"You get a wide assortment and a large number of pieces for the price. Much safer to use glass food storage than plastic, and the flexible lid design prevents the cracking of the lids that I experienced with other glass food storage systems."
Uso estos productos para todo. Desde guardar alimentos cocidos hasta para guardar mis frutas y verduras en el refrigerador. Los uso en el microondas y funcionan bien. No los tapes cuando la comida est√© caliente te ser√° dif√≠cil abrirlo. Para mi son 5 estrellas ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
"These to-go containers are great. I've been using them for 2 weeks now and they're working perfectly. I've brought soup to work and have had no spills at all! That's a win in my book. 10/10, would purchase again."
"I absolutely love the storage containers. It‚Äôs just like the description says. Leak proof , oven and microwave safe. Covers are so easy to open and shut. I got these on a lightning deal as well. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôm saying goodby to my plastic ones. Into the recycle bin they go."
Glassware is packed well and very high quality. Lids fasten tightly and stay put when they are locked on. I have not cooked with them yet but these do everything I need them to do and more.
They came in a very decent and secure package. Nicely organized. I am eager to give it a test and found their lids are very secure and easy to close. All of them are leakproof as described. They are stackable and room saver. I am very happy with the purchase for the superior high quality of the product. I have thrown all my plastic container away and decided to stick to these quality containers. I just worried about how long will the seal on the lid last.
I love these more than I expected. There is the perfect assortment of sizes and I prefer to heat food in the microwave with glass containers instead of plastic.
Best bang for your buck. I got the red color. Color is true to picture. I picked read so I could locate them easily in fridge. It was package VERY WELL! GLASS IS VERY THICK QUALITY! Leak proof! Snaps are firm but easy to snap. I like the Shape and Size variety. This was important to me because I have Rhuematiod Arthritis. Great Product! Will update after few months of uses.
"I love these shapes and sizes for my food storage. From freezer to serving! They help to keep food fresher longer, and I do not have to worry about plastic leaching into my food!"
These came in boxed in 3 boxes!!! I‚Äôm sure It‚Äôs tough to ship glass items but I definitely think this helped my package arrive damage free. I love the different sizes and I love how you can store some of the containers inside one another.
"We are trying to rid our home of plastics and after much searching, I found NuriChef's glass food storage containers. There is a generous number of containers that are just the right sizes with air-tight lids, well priced, and bonus, they nest! Other big-name brands had issues with the rims breaking and the glass shattering in the oven, microwave, etc. there were no such complaints with these containers. If they live up to the hype I plan on buying another set of these!"
"I spent hours searching reviews and ratings to find a set of glass storage containers that were microwaveable, dishwasher safe, and had snap on lids. So far I‚Äôm very impressed with this set of glass containers. They came very nicely packed to prevent any breakage and scratching. I love the variety of sizes since I‚Äôm using these to replace a lot of plastic containers we use for leftovers and reheating. The glass is thick and the lids snap on and off easily. I‚Äôm looking forward to using them."
"Does the job as expected. Lids snap on nicely. Stacking is convenient, although would be nice if lids also had a feature to help organized storage. Quality seems good."
Have just unwrapped well packaged containers. They seem to be high quality and provide many size and shaped storage options. I am very pleased after first review.
These are much better than my old rubber made plastic containers. Air tight seal. Glass containers cook better in the microwave. Better heat transfer for cooking.
"I got the 24 pcs set and they are really nice! Both the glass and lids held up in the dishwasher so far; which was one of my main concerns. They fit inside of each other PERFECTLY; so it helps save room! Also love the fact that you can pick what color you want. Even though I haven‚Äôt had them long yet, I am so far a fan. I do wish they had larger then the 4 cup size to add to my collection though. Even with that though, I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase."
My family loves the locking lids. The gaskets keep the liquid from spilling out. The bowls are nice and thick. The color is nice. Overall a well made product.
"First & foremost, the packaging was amazing! Everything arrived carefully packaged. I was very impressed. The containers nest nicely. I like how strong & durable they are."
Great product. I look forward to using this product for many years. I will update my review after using the products.
Wow I am so happy with the Glass Food storage. It has many size differents and strong lid. I recommend it. I will give 10 thousands stars.
I‚Äôve been putting off getting glass food storage containers but I am so glad that I got these. I got 2 sets and I feel like a real grown up! They don‚Äôt leak dishwasher gets them spotless and I am assuming they are durable until you drop one‚Ä¶. I haven‚Äôt done that yet üíú
"Sturdy glassware with removeable (read, cleanable) gaskets. The snap-tight lids are exactly that - durably made with perfect fit !"
"I recently received these and so far so good. They seem to work well. Good riddance to my old mismatched plastic stuff! I only wish there were more sizes in the mix, especially a large container for soup, etc."
I just received mine. They came really well packaged! Thin glass so I hope they're not delicate. But they stack well and they're cute
Just got them unboxed and very impressed with the quality. Packaging was superior. Looking forward to using them!
Great for leftovers that I store in the freezer. Love the size variety.
"I really like the stackability of these glass containers. They feel like good quality in your hands, but not overly heavy or clunky. I haven't tried them out yet, but so far they seem like a great addition to anyone's kitchen."
"Packaged amazing, Sealed tight when you close them all of the sizes are not too big not too small"
These bowl will be excellent for storing leftovers and creating my own Buddha Bowls. Excellent quality.
Great product at a great price. Much safer than the plastic containers. More durable.
Nice containers. Not too heavy and fingers won‚Äôt get pinched locking the lids
"I was very impressed getting these. Packaged very well and were easy to clean before putting them away. I haven‚Äôt tried in the freezer or oven yet, but for food storage in the fridge, so far have been great!"
So far we are loving these dishes! The lids snap on nicely and they are easy to clean and store!
""
"These are great but for people who use tuperware,but hate the color stains. Reheat pasta and stews, no problems for freezer to microwave with ease. I dont use the lids in the microwave, or in dishwasher because i dont want the lids destroyed by excessive heat. Rubber rings on lids pop off easily, I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing? These are for small left overs, not enough large storage containers."
Quality product! Really happy with it. I would order more if I had the space in the kitchen. Love them.
"I bought these containers to get rid of my plastic containers. These glass containers are awesome! They will not stain, warp, or crack like plastic. They also can go from freezer to oven. They stack inside one another for easy storage. These were a great purchase for my busy family."
"A nice assortment of sizes, to handle everything we needed to store."
Packaging was amazing and carefully done. The variety of sizes are perfect.
"Good quality products that should last a lifetime if properly used and cared for. Sure beats using those plastic alternatives that end up getting destroyed in the microwave, or look so bad you kind of don't want to eat what's in there."
"I love the leak proof lids , the glass is not to heavy , gasket is easily removable for cleaning something very important to me"
"I have been looking for some containers that are microwave friendly, all the plastic ones melt or stain. I am so happy with these they lock tight and are great for the microwave! Super happy will be buying another set!"
I was worried about the weight but feels sturdy when I use them. Threw out all of the plastic storage bowls. My cabinet looks so pretty and organized.
I haven‚Äôt used it yet but it looks amazing so far. It is very easy to open and close. I have bought different storage containers but this one has been my favorite so far. Happy customer 10/10000
If you‚Äôre thinking of buying these ... do it! Love them I‚Äôve organized one cabinet already and ordered another set to keep going They are super thick not flimsy which is a plus And the tops are easy to snap on This set also comes with display stickers and a white pen for labeling which are super cute
"Lot of negative reviews. I‚Äôll update as these get used. But great start to what was a completely chaotic pantry cupboard. Good amount of containers for what I needed. Oddly the chalk marker was phenomenal too, usually they half work or uneven."
"I think these containers are great for the price point. The quality is good. They aren‚Äôt super fancy but defintely serve their purpose! The lids are air tight. I find the various sizes are great and I can use them for lots of different things (flour, pasta, sugar, nuts, etc)! It comes with extra labels as well."
"( i will post a picture soon) I wasn't sure that I chose the right set to do the job. My issue is more about size of certain containers. I feel like everyone should get a mix of say 4 sizes but I found I kinda had to piece my set together cause I just couldn't find 1. I understand we all don't eat the same and everyone's pantry won't be alike. For my kitchen I need big containers for my flour, sugar(2), yes I do alot of frying, bread making, cake baking. So I need big containers for the flour, the cane sugar and the powdered sugar. For my pantry I'd need a container for corn meal, white rice, pop corn (6), cereal(3)I'd want 6 pieces for stuff like chips and cookies."
"These are great, I love the marker instead of chalk that comes with them to write on the stickers. My pantry looks so much better now."
I am obsessed with these! I was sick of my pantry lookin like a hot mess and put these on my Christmas list! I literally tore my pantry apart and started organizing it immediately after I got these! I love the stylish look and ease of seeing what‚Äôs in the container. I plan on purchasIng more to finish up the pantry.
"Very durable set that holds up well with all types of snacks. I wanted to really try this out for a good few weeks before writing this review and it truly is worth the price. I‚Äôve stored everything from cereal to fruit snacks in here and it NEVER becomes stale. The quality is excellent and it looks great for pantry organization, highly recommend."
I decided to use containers to organize my pantry. These work perfectly. You have an assortment of sizes and they came with stickers and a marker so you can label each container. I loved them so much I purchased a couple more sets. I would definitely recommend for anyone ready to start organizing the pantry!
My family and I do a lot of bulk and wholesale shopping so being able to get rid of the boxes and store them neatly in these containers were so nice.  Tight sealer Various sizes Cute labels included
A great selection of useful sizes and the NICE THING is the lids are one size so no more searching for a lid or having to toss out containers because you cannot find the lid.
"These are all very versatile and leak proof! They are a little narrower than I imagined making it harder to get a measuring cup inside (so you have to pour), but they‚Äôre still great for the price!"
"These sure did come in handy when we last cleaned out our cabinets. They have wonderful labels and come in a variety of sizes to fit all our kitchen organization needs. The lids were a bit stiff when they were first purchased and I was concerned they would not stay closed, but after washing them and closing each lid on it's base, I have not had any issues with stiffness to them."
Bought for my very organized nephew for Christmas. He loves them. He's using them in his pantry.
Love these! I don‚Äôt like how hard it is to snap the lids but they definitely serve purpose.
I absolutely loved the fact that all the lids are the same size! There is no drawer full of random lids that I can't figure out where they go. The lid snap on all four sides giving a great seal. Have only had these for a few weeks but so far loving them! I would buy more in the future.
"This is the second set I've bought. The first didn't break, despite being dropped many times! I bought more to further organize. The containers are sturdy and airtight. Definitely recommend!"
I love these containers more than I thought I would my pantry is tidy and it came with labels and a chalk pen
Fit in my pantry very well
Very good product. I have ordered before. However this time I am missing one container lid from order. I am not happy about that.
They came with cute stickers that are reusable. The kids are universal fit for all the jars. Dishwasher safe as I‚Äôve washed them and still super air tight and leak proof. 10/10
I love the design and stacking look i had a whole bunch of boxes and bags its a space saver and life changer.
"I would have liked one more tall however they serve the purpose for which I used them for. They are air tight, and makes storage easy to identify items in the pantry."
"These worked great for organizing my pantry. I labeled them and set them on the shelves filled with beans, granola, etc‚Ä¶looks so good!"
"Products are great. Sturdy. Leakproof. I would rated this 4 stars due to having 2 small containers chipped. However, I reached out to customer service and they responded within 2 hrs. I was not able to get replacement as they come in a set, but I was refunded for damaged items."
Love the different sizes and the quality. We live in the South so anything with lids that fit tight is a must! Highly recommend.
"I bought these to store a variety of snacks, pancake mix, etc in our camper. Everything stayed dry and fresh between outings!"
The food storage containers have been a great addition to my pantry. They are sleek and stackable which helps keep my pantry organized. I have noticed that my food is fresher longer also.
These have kept my food fresher than a chip clip on a chip bag or cereal bag. My pantry is less chaotic also.
Love these storage containers. They‚Äôre airtight and keep everything fresh much longer not to mention how nice they look.
We love them. I'm all about saving space so it was a huge help. I love the tight secured tops and thickness. I also enjoyed it came with the labels and marker. Highly recommend to others.
Great for cabinet organization! I love these for storing stacks. So much easier to see what I have in the cabinet then having 1000‚Äôs of bags and boxes!
"I open my cabinets now and can find what I need, also no more spillage when trying to bring items out of the cabinet."
Use them to store food in for organizing cub board
One size lids seal very tight which is what I was looking for.
Very great product to make your cabinets look organized and love the labels it comes with.
These work great! I needed something the keep all my Parrot‚Äôs treat‚Äôs in!
I use these under my parrots'cages to store their food and treats. They sell tightly and keep things fresh.
These allow me to see what I have and. Helps when preparing meals
"These are fantastic. I love them,keeps everything fresh and preserved."
Glad I bought!
This was the perfect gift for a son who is looking to do some organizing in his kitchen.
Love these storage containers. It made my pantry look so much more organized and nice. I want more!
Excellent assortment of sizes. Great for organizing my new pantry.
These work amazing. They look nice and are good quality! Highly recommend!
Very snug when snapped the items should stay fresh
These containers are great for cabinet storage. I love having my kitchen organized!
Perfect for organizing a cupboard
"Airtight storage , leak proof"
These are so convenient and definitely took my counter tops to another level. I‚Äôm very happy I purchased these!
"I am so happy I made this purchase! Nuts, seeds, oats, almonds, teas, matcha all neatly stored and now easy to access!  Should have purchased these a long time ago"
"I had to reorganize the pantry in a way that would provide me with enough space, this product has definitely come in handy. So far it does just as it promises"
So far I am happy with this product. They are very sleek and can see the contents easily. What I like the most is all the lids are the same size so no more lid matching.
They are a uniformed look which is nice for an open shelf concept. I store my secure shake mix in them.
Love that it keeps thing organized and food fresh.
The size of the containers is good. The lids were very stiff the first time a tried to use them but bend them back and forth a few times and the worked great.
I love the extra chalk labels and chalk pen they sent with them!!!
"Organization for my flour, sugar, seeds, protein powder etc.. dry goods."
Amazing boxes for dried food storage.
Perfect ! Secure lids. I love them.
"I loved them , I thought they were a bit larger but nevertheless they got the job done"
"Love the size of these containers to store chips, cookies etc. Highly recommend!"
Love the different sizes and the lids are so neatleak proof stackable
Obsessed with how they made my pantry & fridge look! May be ordering some more in the future!
I love these! my cabinet looks 10000 times better! i can see everything inside
Perfect size
Absolutely love my set
Received item in good condition. Product construction and quality good. Would have preferred locks with pinned hinges ( not product fault) for longevity. I wonder if this company makes these.
Very good quality and sturdy as well. Mad a difference when organizing my pantry
met expectations
Love these containers! I‚Äôve used them for pretty much anything and everything!
I just took every package and box out of my cabinets and wrap them in plastic containers with sealed covers love it looks neat and clean stays neat and clean and everything stays fresh I'm even thinking about ordering a really big one so I don't get older and moldy
These containers are great and they seal so tight that they are a little hard to put the covers on and seal them. I pretty well have a system for that problem and they seal so tight it‚Äôs worth the effort. They come with labels and a measuring set. They are a nice fit for my cupboards and it looks so neat.
These came in all the right sizes for my needs. The lids are airtight and easy to use. I haven't used them for liquid items so not sure about the leak proof.
"Son muy buenos, en lo personal me encanto. Son dobles y seguros. Como toda cosa tiene un PERO y en este caso son las tapaderas ya que cuesta cerrarlas, pero creo es por lo nuevo ya que se usen pienso que ser√° m√°s f√°cil. Pero si lo recomiendo, mi espacio quedo muy bonito me ahorre mucho espacio."
Shape of containers fit in the cupboards. My food has remained fresh as the day I bought it and placed in the container
I love the different sizes. They give me the opportunity to fit a little bit of everything inside. I might get myself another set.
These are working great in my trailer! Love them!!!
I just purchased my 3rd set so I could do my daughter in laws cabinet‚Äôs also. Love these
"As a value pack, this was worth it!"
Perfectamente funcional.
"Air tight,"
"estos productos son muy practicos para los pequenos espacios, en la nevera, y tambien en la despensa ya que el espacio que necesita es hacia arriba y sobra bastante espacio despues que se almacena todo lo que se pueda en ellos, ahora tengo mas organizacion en mi cocina estoy"
The containers work as they should. The first time closing the lids it was difficulty but then it kept getting better. I would purchase it again.
Can‚Äôt evaluate...they‚Äôre still new.
"These are great containers, the lids are airtight and the containers are sturdy. Along with the pen and labels make it easy to mark all of your containers. Love them, will be buying more!"
Love these containers good size great price would recommend to anyone
Excelente organizadores para almacenar nuestros productos de la cocina
I‚Äôve ordered these a couple times. I use them in the kitchen and in my medicine closet to keep things organized. I use them for my dog‚Äôs meds too
Gave a 4/5 because some kids are hard to shut.
"The pictures are true to what you receive. I probably could have used more of the large sizes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because some of the lids are stiff and hard to attach. The first set I got were easy to attach but the second set was stiff. Makes it hard for arthritic hands. These stack nicely and do a great job for rice, flour, pasta, beans, etc."
"Loving these so far. I do wish they had more of the bigger sizes, but I've been able to utilize them all nicely."
Looks nice. So far seems to keep the food fresh. Some of the lids are hard to put on.
They work good and did what they say they do I need to order larger ones
"I thought the containers would be larger, one of the largest doesn't even hold one bag of chips or cereal. The lids are stiff at first but get easier with use. Overall, good purchase."
These are a bitch to close. Not as nice as others I have purchased.
They were ok for storage. Some would leak and some didn‚Äôt
The only complaint i have is that i dont have more! Lol
"Expected the containers to be clearer than they actually are. Definitely, they don't quite look like the photos on the Amazon site. Also the lids fit terribly and incredibly hard to fit. One of the largest containers was cracked and couldn't be used. Wouldn't recommend this. Won't reorder."
One of the boxes came broken. I thought it was just a crack but saw that the whole box was broken. Cannot use this now. Rest others were good
"The plastic container is too flimsy for how tight the lids fit. Had a difficult time getting the flaps to clamp down, it would squeeze the container and not clip into place."
"These are not clear Lucie looking plastic. It is cheaper looking and NOT clear at all. Also, not water-tight lids."
Lids doesn‚Äôt fir. Returning item
"I am so happy with these containers! Get some for you or for a gift! -The lids fit on all of the container sizes, so you don't have to figure out where they all go. Thank goodness! -Easy to wash. Dishwasher and freezer safe. The rubber pieces in the lids are easy to remove to clean and easy to put back on. -The labels are included, so that you can place them wherever you want them. -A white marker is included to use for labeling. It's not a vivid white when you write on the black stickers. I wish it was a brighter white, but not a big deal. It is still easy to read. -The containers are labeled with measurements so you know how much is in each container. -Great sized containers. None of them are too small or too big to use."
"Stackable, dishwasher safe, freezer safe and they don't leak! It's hard to find storage containers that are all of these things in one that don't cost a fortune.  I am always looking for ways to cut down on space taken up by storage containers that don't do everything I want them to.  These are perfect with a great price so I have nothing to complain about.  The seals are the best I have found, I put dried goods in them and months later it's like I just bought them.  I also think they would make a great gift for someone just moving into their first place, they will come in handy and become a favorite for storage.  Quite happy and of course, would recommend."
if your kitchen needs organization get these or you for some reason have a bunch of opened flour that is making a mess in your cabinets these are perfect for combing all the bags into one cube and getting rid of the mess while freeing up space at the same time. We used them to store all our different salts and sugars as well. We were extremely grateful for the label paper it came with because the amount of stuff we have that looks a like but is in fact not what you want would be grounds for a lot of mistakes lol.
"This is the perfect set if you are organizing your kitchen staples. It contains a variety of sizes so that different size packages fit perfectly. There are labels but I found the canisters were see-through enough that most things didn‚Äôt even need a label. However, should you use the labels, a damp cloth erases them to re-label. The tops snap down making an air tight seal to keep dry goods fresh. This is a good set. Your pantry will look so neat."
"You get 16, four stacks with one of each size. A pack of labels with marker and measuring cups. I'm able to get 1 normal sized box of cereal in the largest container. The others I've used pancake mix, noodles. Open packs of crackers hoping to keep them fresh in an air tight space and rice. For gifting idea fill them with candies or other goodies for the holidays and pop a cute bow on top. I didn't have a bow on hand or it would be in the picture. All in all these are great."
"These are really solid containers.  The lids are really tight to put on, so you gotta press a good amount to fit them perfectly and this is so you can have a great seal.  The look of them is fantastic. The overall quality seems great too.  Would recommend these for sure."
"When I first took these out of the box, I wasn't overly impressed. They aren't exactly clear ... you can see through them but they are a little opaque. They are a bit more bendy than I expected but still sturdy. Overall, for the price and how many you get, I am glad I ordered these and would recommend them to someone who didn't want to spend 4 or 5 times more at somewhere like the container store.  Tupperwear is not cheap. Although the seal is pretty simple on these, it keeps air out. You snap the top piece's corner flaps onto the bottom storage container and a small rubber seal inside keeps air from getting in or out. I was having disgusting little bugs get into even my ziplock bags of pasta and rice. I'd either see them or their dirty little sheddings in my pasta or rice and have to throw it all out. I knew I needed some sort of airtight tupperwear and these were priced right for a set of various sizes.  These are simply plastic injection molded containers which are likely very cheap to make. They say BPA-free, which is a hard thing to prove. I looked high and low for reasonably priced glass containers, as I'd rather not worry about potential plastic leeching into the stored food. However, either the glass version of these was unavailable or the glass versions used plastic lids anyways. I figured, since I could find nothing made of glass, these would be a good solution.  What really makes these awesome is the uniformity. In a cupboard, it looks so neat and organized when you have a matching row of these. They are good for different pastas, dry goods like flour, sugar, rice, etc. and I like the various sizes. They'd work to keep cereal, breadcrumbs or crackers fresh. The lid snap sides do take up some space which means you cant stack as many next to each other. One thing I will mention ... the small rubber trim on the inside of the cover which keeps the seal fresh looks like it could easily pop out at some point during washing. This would make the seal not airtight and bugs and air could once again contaminate your goods.  I will likely use tape and a sharpie to date the contents. Bottom line is if you are looking for matching sealed containers, these aren't the most high end of products, but they are effective and nice to have. For a serial organizer or a person who needs to organize more, these will do just that in your closet. I would order them again. They work well and look great."
"I like these storage containers better than I thought I would. I was afraid they wouldn't hold as much as the pictures show, but they actually do. I could have used a few more of the large ones and a few less of the smallest ones, but they do make storage of things like pasta and nuts more convenient. The containers have been durable so far, and the only complaint I have in craftsmanship is that the some of the lids don't fit as easily as they should. Some are hard to lock down. Other than that, this is a good set and worth the money."
"This is a decent set of storage containers. The lids are a little hard to get on at first as others have said, but at least they hold well versus what I experienced with another type I got in the past. The variation in sizes is helpful for different items, and the bonus items that came with them are great additions."
√ötiles y apropiados. Me encantaron m√°s de lo que esperaba.
"Made such a huge difference in my pantry. Price is great and quality is great. Would definitely recommend buying, no regrets!"
Flour and sugar and pancake mix is stored in them and they are secure. I like them. Plus the additional measuring cups was a great along with it.
""
"If I wasn‚Äôt so lazy I would send them back. The lids do not go on smoothly like the Rubbermaid Brilliance containers and it is nearly impossible to separate the containers right out of the box, which are stacked."
"These are a great balance of lightweight but sturdy. They make an EXCELLENT seal with the lock down sides and gasket. Holds humidity perfectly (per my hygrometer)! If you're looking for using them for this purpose, do it!!!"
"I've bought several of these containers in a variety of sizes. I use them mainly for dry goods and refrigerator storage. These containers have wonderful lids that snap on easily and form a tight seal and the body is beautifully clear.  Unfortunately, the plastic its made of is cracking. I've only had these containers a couple of months and I've found fine cracks forming all along the curved edge where the bottom and sides meet. Over time these cracks get longer and thicker until the plastic gives way altogether. Mind you, despite the rating on these containers, they have never been in the freezer, have rarely been microwaved, and the only dishwasher in this house is me. They haven't been dropped or banged around so I must conclude that the flaw is in the material itself.  This is a monumental disappointment from a well reputed company like Rubbermaid. I paid a pretty penny for these and they are not even a durable as the ""disposable"" containers I've used that have lasted for years. Bad show Rubbermaid."
""
"Absolutely love these! Bought a small set at the local wallyworld to store all my dried beans in and found I needed more. Too many beans. Oh wait, that can't be right. You can never have too many beans. Anyway. The lids are so cool! They snap on a bit like that home party plastic ware we all used to buy. They are clear as a sunny day so you can SEE what's in there and they stack! I know you can cook with them in the microwave but I don't use any kind of plastic that way. Besides I only wanted them for storage. I need a few more ..."
"The best containers in the world. I eat a whole food plant based diet and use these for everything. I use several sizes. The large 9.6 ""flat"" style is great for bean dishes. When I come home from the store with 5 different lettuces, I wash and prepare each and put them in these containers. Then when I make a salad everything is ready. I eat two LARGE salads a day."
"These containers are NOT airtight. They are NOT leakproof.  I intended to use them to bring salads to work (pre-dressed). If the container is not perfectly flat in my bag, they heavily leak salad dressing. The first time I brought one to work, it destroyed many of my papers and books (they are now stained with balsamic vinegar). And yes, I made sure the container was 100% perfectly sealed. That wasn't an isolated incident. Any time I have liquid in them and don't have the container lying perfectly flat, it leaks liquid.  I no longer bring them to work, and I just use them around the kitchen. It's a shame because I paid nearly three times as much to have a container that was truly leak proof so I could transport my salads. If I had known how poorly made they were, I could have just bought a low quality one dollar container. It would have served the same purpose.  Anyhow, DO NOT buy these thinking they are leak proof. You will be sadly disappointed."
"UPDATE: 1. The prices on these are going up due to high demand. 2. you need at least 3-4 60g packets to get the proper humidity.  Air tight and easily holds 48 Deadwood Sweet Janes (5 x 46).  If your using a Boveda pack, use at least 2. Also give it about 24-48 hrs to adjust humidity.  Wish they made a slighly bigger version."
"We ordered these after purging our hodgepodge collection of containers to try to bring some sanity to our food storage. These are perfect containers. We bought 2 of the 9.6 cup ones and 4 of the 4.7 cup ones. We've stored everything from soup, fruit, stew, pasta, etc. We've also dual purposed them for lunches to take to work. They're light and durable and the perfect size for a salad.  I'd recommend these to anyone! They're still holding up strong after constant use."
This is one of my favorite containers. Its a fabulous size and The containers does not stain with spaghetti even if you heat it up in the container. The size is perfect for a good amount of leftovers.The lids are very tight. There are actually air holes undert the grey clamps so you don't have to take the lid off when microwaving you can just pop the clamps open and that provides venting. Also when you push the lid down on it with the clamps up it almost forms a vaccum seal. Sometimes it can be a little hard getting the lid off because of that vaccum seal. But I love that because i know my food is well protected. I have a larger set of these with a variety of sizes but I bought this size because I new I would use it a lot and I have. They stack neatly in the fridge. A friend of mine looked in my fridge and was complimenting on how organized my fridge looked LOL I thought she was being sarcastic at first then i realized she was serious. I walked over and asked her what she was talking about. I had these containers stacked with food in them. Apparently it made my fridge look neat haha okay ...bonus. Buy them you wont regret it. I use them everyday.
"These are truly leak proof. I‚Äôve brought soup, couscous, stew, all kinds of wet, leaky foods in these containers daily to work.  They do not leak at all. As a rule I never heat food in them, it‚Äôs been proven to be unhealthy, no matter how good/healthy the plastic.  But for carrying food they are light as a feather, unlike my glass containers.  They will not leak on you, they come in all sorts of sizes. And mine dont stain, but I don‚Äôt use them in microwaves.  Great to throw in your purse, hop on the bus or train with no worries.  I like the 1.3 cup size for work. Plus it‚Äôs portion control.  Get them, store and travel with hem. But don‚Äôt heat up your food in them or any plastic ever."
"Bought several sizes from Amazon and liked them so much that I bought a huge set from Costco when they ran them on sale. Gave my other food storage sets to my sons! They are lightweight, don't cloud up, don't change colors, stack perfectly in cabinet and fridge, see through, bottom of dishwasher ok and can microwave in them. However I do take the lid off and cover with paper plate although instructions say you can microwave with lid not locked down. Just can say enough positive things about these! Love Love Love them!"
"I've slowly been replacing all of my Tupperware, old Rubbermaid and odds and ends for rubbermade brilliance collection. I absolutely love these containers. They keep everything fresh they don't break when dropped on the kitchen floor and they clean up excellent. Bought my first strawberries of the year put the entire container into the large brilliance as soon as I got home. 3 days later took them out washed and sliced them there wasn't a bad spot on them. Now 4 days later from when I sliced them you can see the picture that they're beautiful. I'd say that's a huge test considering you buy strawberries and they're dead in 2 days no matter what you do."
This is a really good product -- I can bring juicy food to work and not find it leaking all over the inside of my bag. I only wish they had a step up size between the 1.3 cup and the 3.2 cup size. 1.3 cups is a bit small for cottage cheese and frozen blueberries and the 3.2 size is a little large. A 2 cup or 2.25 cup size would be just perfect. (I'm having a Goldilocks moment! here)
"This product is very high quality. They make the most of your storage space. The seals are excellent. I've dropped several with contents in them and they stayed sealed. I want to warn you though, you have to shop around. Some sellers offer them at very high prices. You can find the same model on Amazon for different prices. It depends on the sellers and be wary make sure you can use every piece if you are buying a set. But, you can find sets that have the sizes you want and can save money by purchasing them that way."
"These containers are great! Easy to clean, food stays fresh longer, and they reheat food in the microwave without becoming too warm to handle. I was purchasing avocados sparingly because they turn dark so quickly in the refrigerator; however, I have found with these air tight containers that I can have half an avocado and put the other half upside down in the container and wait 2 days and it's barely starting to turn dark and tastes wonderful. My partner enjoys cut up cucumbers and trying to keep them from becoming spongy and soft was a problem until these containers. They keep the cut cucumbers fresh for up to a week and they remain crispy and taste really good. These containers clean up easy and I love that the rubber seal does not need to be removed."
"I‚Äôm so ready for healthy meal delivery services to start using these dishwasher safe reusable containers. I love my meal plan at Thistle, but there is so much waste. This container is perfect for a to go salad form my favorite salad place. There is some weird law that the restaurant can‚Äôt put the salad in the container for liability reasons. So, I have to order on a plate and put the salad in the container myself. This world can be so annoying, why make it harder to stop overs using plastic. Probably some plastic company slipped in the rule to prevent less plastic use. Anyway, these containers have been perfect for to go salads. They have enough air space to the salad stays fresh, and make it easy to toss in the dressing with the lid closed. I wish GoBOX used these, they kinda work better, not sure how recyclable they are, or what number plastic they use."
"These are hands down the best food storage containers ever manufactured. I am simply in love with them in every way, and the pros of their design hugely outweigh every con. I'll share both below, but first my experienced advice when purchasing this kind of product/material:  Only hand wash these. Even though they are dishwasher safe, and they truly are, we are only washing ours by hand. They will come out of the dishwasher looking as new as when you purchased them, yes, but eventually they will degrade and get hairline scratches or cracks. These are the only items that remain on our counter to be hand washed because I want to preserve the finish and beauty for as many years as possible. [ ***UPDATE almost year later*** Sure enough, one of my kids accidentally put one in the dishwasher twice, and today it has rippling effect in the plastic over several areas, and there are two cracks starting. They are still clear and still look nice, but I hate that it ruined the perfect clear smooth look of the piece. Do NOT use these in dishwasher if you want to preserve the brand new look. You won't find better quality than these, because all the top quality dishwasher safe plastic does this regardless what they say.] Only use a soft dishcloth with dish soap, NOT a dishwand - unless the wand uses the really soft sponge attachments without any abrasive finishes or scrubbing surfaces, even if it's the scratch-free/scratch-resistant kind for non-stick cookware, etc. Using those kinds of wand sponges on this kind of plastic, regardless its durability, will scratch it almost immediately the first time, at first with a couple hairline scuffs you can't see without tilting in the right light, and then it will build to an eventual noticeable haze or streaks and swirls of scratches. I know this because I have used this kind of plastic for 13 years and ruined some of the most beautiful glasses and bowls. We have an inground pool, and I have spent years finding and purchasing high quality, crystal clear plastic glasses and dishes so that we won't have broken glass or ceramic anywhere near our pool or patio and ruin our liner. No matter what kind I buy, even the highest end and most expensively made, over time they do start to get a hazy or scuffed finished so many washes with dishwands, and dishwashers WILL eventually cause hairline cracks. I love these so much that I don't want to risk this happening again, or at least not for another 15 or 20 years.  [ ***UPDATE almost year later*** Everything I said below is still spot on. The entire collection looks gorgeous and one of the sizes is always a perfect fit for whatever we want to put in it.]  PROS: - not just crystal clear, but beautiful glass-like clear over the entire surface and lid - you would swear they are glass. They are beautiful in my fridge and make it actually look lovely even when it's cluttered and a mess. LOL We love clearly seeing the contents in full color no matter what angle it is or what it is on top of or under or behind. You know how we try to easily see what is behind something else in our fridge? This requires the smallest peek to see the contents. Less waste due to hurriedness or memory loss! heh heh  - a safe BPA free plastic that won't interfere with the safety of your food in the microwave  - ingenious lid design. I just love it. Line it up and push down and the rubber edging under the lid snuggly fits into place creating an airtight seal. The handles on the lid locks them in place even though they truly wouldn't come off without that. But the feature is a plus when tossing around in a lunch bag or in a freezer/fridge. Venting under the lock handles is also smart as ever. Lock handle design provides smooth operation that is never difficult to snap down or pull up.  - The lids may not stack neatly nested into a thin stack because of the lovely and necessary seal on the undersides, as well as the locking handles, but we place all the lids on their side edges stacked in one of this set's largest containers and it is easy to pull just one out without making a mess with the others. You could simply use another plastic rectangular container for this so you can easily remove the large container, or purchase a really nice holder for these lids. This is the one I'm saving up for because it will fit the lid for the large rectangular containers too: https://www.amazon.com/InterDesign-Cabinet-Binz-Compartment-Organizer/dp/B01M4IZFE9/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1539108799&sr=8-5&keywords=plastic+lid+storage+organizer And these two would fit the small and medium ones nicely if you have a large number of containers: https://www.amazon.com/YouCopia-50100-StoraLid-Container-Organizer/dp/B07FNRXFTD/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1539108799&sr=8-7&keywords=plastic+lid+storage+organizer and https://www.amazon.com/mDesign-Kitchen-Container-Storage-Organizer/dp/B0778SFR19/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1539108799&sr=8-6&keywords=plastic+lid+storage+organizer  - The bottoms do nest nicely. Not all the way down, but you really wouldn't want that because over time a surface will develop very fine hairline scuffs from the friction. I'm certain on these they will be hard to notice for years to come, unless tilted at just the right angle, due to their glass-like finish. These nest sufficiently to save space, and limits the amount of that expected scuffing over a long time. So far we have none and we use these every single day - rarely using any of our others anymore.  - They have not stained at all. Red spaghetti residue easily washes off with soap and a gentle rag. Simply rinsing in warm or hot water will not take it off because the coloring is trapped in the oils, and you need the soap to remove the oil. The surface of this plastic is not porous so it just waits for you to wash it.  - The sizes were certainly thoughtful and Rubbermaid set out to find the perfect size offerings that would fit most foods that you are looking for that size in, and deep enough to accommodate the lid while being nice and full. They fit more than you would think they would and you don't realize it until you are actually placing the food in.  - The lids come off easily if you know the right way. It's an airtight seal, folks, so it is going to have some kind of suction resistance. However, the proper way to remove them doesn't have such a strong resistance. You leave them flat on the counter, place a hand on side of the container, or the opposite end of the lid from the corner you are lifting up, (too keep the whole container from lifting up,) and gently lift up on only one corner until it pops right up and off. It won't be as easy trying to pop off two corners at once or lifting from a side edge between corners. We never have a problem removing them now, and it will be easy even when my hands no longer have the strength and dexterity to manipulate lids, so I believe older people do not have to worry and these are the best containers to get right now with this much ease.  CONS: - stackability of the lids...but - meh - they still fit nicely in the way I store them on their edges.  - washing and drying the lids at the edges and under the seal. Any design change to make that easier would lose the more important air-tight fit that has an ease to putting the lid on and taking it off. You have to remember to slide a finger with the towel around it under the seal all the way around - which actually can be done smoothly and quickly due to the curved and smooth design, and then run the towel around the indented edges on both sides. Sure - it takes more time, but since you'll enjoy looking at these in all ways, even when cleaning, it won't bother you. I just recite in my head while I'm drying them how much I love these and how they are the best purchase I have ever made, and before I know it I'm done. LOL  - they are expensive. But they are worth the cost, and you can space out purchasing different sizes over weeks or months until you finally have the collection you want to have. I still have about two to three more purchases to complete mine, but by the beginning of next year I'll have it complete. Worth the wait! Trust me."
"These are the best plastic containers that I have ever used and I have purchased additional quantities since my original purchase. The rubber sealing around the edges gives you a totally leak proof container and the two flip locks just give you added security. It takes a while to get used to opening these when they have been sealed, but once you do, you will agree that there are the best (and probably the last) type of plastic container that you will ever buy. I got a great price on Amazon, so it motivated to try them, but even at a premium, they are worth it."
I have bought sets of different sizes and sets of the same sizes I have ordered so many of these these have become my favorite containers love the fit and how they stack and nest for storage. They stack well in the freezer and the refrigerator also and you can see the contents easily the only thing I don't like is the Liz a little difficult to get off but once you get the hang of it and find your way of doing it it becomes easier. Instead of pulling the lid off I find that putting my thumb on the corner and using my two four fingers to lift up on the lid on the same side of the container is the easiest way for me. Other than that they are perfect I've had no issues with hinges / vents breaking yet or any issues with dishwasher freezer or microwave. Will definitely be buying more over the years once I get rid of all my other containers.
"I use this thing on bicycle tours--it's lightweight, fairly durable, and fits perfectly inside my front pannier, a Sports-Packer Plus from Ortlieb. It's also very spacious, and I can toss a huge meal inside and chomp on it all day without worrying that it will spill.  I've used my Brilliance container a LOT on tour. It's gotten beat up, so much that it's developed little cosmetic cracks and lost some of the leak-proof seal around the lid. But it lasted much longer than expected given the price, and weighs much less than a higher quality glass or pyrex counterpart. If you're looking for a container that will last the better part of a decade, you might consider other options. But if you want something that's a step above a budget tupperware yet can still hold up on tour, the Brilliance series is probably worth your time."
"These containers are amazing. Not only are they truly airtight (to the point that releasing them yields a whoosh of air entering the container) but they are easily cleaned with no staining. I originally purchased these to help organize my pantry, which they allowed me to do. Later, I purchased more because they are airtight and provide a level of confidence that has enabled me to move items kept in the refrigerator (to prevent bug infestation) on to the counter or into the pantry (flour, sugar, brown sugar, etc.). This has saved refrigerator room while allowing me to be confident that bugs can't get in! The versatility of the sizes and their stack-ability were pluses that resulted in me purchasing even more. I have completely replaced all my other containers with this product. I used them for storage of soups, stews, and taco meat with no staining and easy clean-up. I highly recommend this line of products for pantry, refrigerator, and food storage. This size is great for leftover stew, soup, and other items requiring refrigeration. While I have not tried them in the freezer (the opportunity has not presented itself yet), I am confident they would work there, too. I will likely buy more and hope that Rubbermaid keeps this line going for years to come!"
I use for cigar storage. Keeps them at 70%rh with 2 Boveda packs. One month without deviation. Open it monthly to refresh. Would purchase again. Holds about 40 Toros maybe more.
"I love this Rubbermaid container! So much so, that I also purchased the ""medium"" size. (More about the medium size in a bit.)  If you want to make sure that whatever you put inside a container, stays inside, this is a product you should try. You get a very tight seal when you close it and it has clamps on each side that flip down to further guarantee no leaking. The size was perfect for what I needed it for, but make sure you look at the dimensions before buying.  Okay, the ""medium"" size came and it is actually two smaller containers. I knew it would be two containers, but they are quite small‚Äìnot what I would consider medium compared to the larger one that I received before. To me the two ""medium""-sized *combined* would have made one nice medium sized container. That being said I still found uses for the smaller two.  Overall I am quite pleased with these durable Rubbermaid containers. They definitely live up to Rubbermaid's good reputation."
"These pieces in the Brilliance collection are remarkable. Say goodbye to lingering smells stained plastic, and leaking storage. I use these for all my dry products as well as wet. I used to be a committed to a different manufacturer but not any more. I use Rubbermaid Brilliance collection exclusively . Make sure to look at all the pieces in this collection. You'll find what you need and be extremely satisfied."
"...other plastic containers crack when used in the freezer, and we wanted something to put our frozen berries in. The bags for Aldi frozen fruit are so difficult to close along the seam after opening. The 4.7 cup size is perfect for fitting most of a 24 oz bag of frozen strawberries or blueberries. What won't fit, we put in a leftover container in the fridge to use in our smoothies or yogurt desserts. Hubby and I both have bum thumbs, and we can easily open and close these containers. One of the containers was difficult to open the first time but we haven't had problems since. Perhaps the seal hadn't fully dried after washing it before using, and the water froze along the seal that first time."
"I've purchased similar containers from other companies. They work excellent at first but over time they develop issues. One issue is that after a few dishwasher runs the lids tend to shrink which isn't the best thing especially when you are taking a lunch to school only to have it spill everywhere. These Rubbermaid Brilliance Food Storage Container are the ticket. Food lasts longer, liquids don't spill and after a few months of use they continue looking brand new. I will definitely be purchasing more of these as I replace my Tupperware."
I love this product so much I have ordered 2 full sets and 2 extras of the 9.6 cup containers. The 9.6 cup containers are perfect for Romaine lettuce and stores for days in the refrigerator. I place a paper towel on top of the lettuce to draw out moisture this helps keep it crisp and fresh while staying in the airtight containers. Doesn't turn brown....I will be ordering more for my family.
"These containers are great! They do not become discolored. They seal very well and I have not had any leaks. I travel with them often. They microwave things nicely as long as you open the latches so it can vent. They clean up nicely in the dishwasher. I own lots of these in lots of different sizes. I love that they are clear so that everyone in the house can see what is inside of a container. If no one can see it, it often doesn't get used, and ends up in the garbage. We use some for powdered products like flour and powdered sugar. They work great for that. I really have nothing bad to say about them. Highly recommend!"
"I love these! The venting holes under the locks are such smart design. Seeing my food through the clear plastic makes me happy. I feel like my fridge is brighter, the food is more appealing. I never would‚Äôve thought that spending money on such a thing would bring me Joy, but it does. Using for about 4 months pretty much daily and so far they look almost brand new. There is a dimple in the top that cracked a bit, but it hasn‚Äôt affected function. The plastic is as clear as the day we bought it. The only thing I don‚Äôt like, is that they don‚Äôt fit very well into our dishwasher, and dishwasher water collects on the rim, so we wind up having to dry them in the drying rack anyway. This is annoying, but if that‚Äôs the sacrifice I need to make for otherwise perfect storage equipment, I‚Äôm happy to do that"
"Absolutely fabulous storage container - stacks in the drawer to save space, stacks in the refrigerator to save space, stacks in the freezer to save space, easy to see contents, easy to open/close for old fingers, easy to microwave."
These containers are by far the best thing going. The only problem I have with them is that the covers are hard to get off. But they really do what they claim as far as being leak proof and air tight. They are durable enough to withstand anything you do to them. I bought this large size so when I make a batch of soup or something to freeze I know I won‚Äôt have to cook for a couple of days when I throw it in the microwave with the top vented. Once it is empty it goes right in the dishwasher. Now if only they could make the covers easier to remove for people who have trouble with their wrists that would be great but I still highly recommend these. The product and the price is great too.
"In my opinion, these are the best leftover containers out there. I have had them for years and have just gifted them to my daughter and daughter-in-law. My daughter thanks me every time I talk to her, and she has been through every other option on the market. They are leakproof, durable, dishwasher safe ( I always use the top shelf but they say you can use either), stackable, and attractive. I also love that you can see exactly what is in them. We all have several sets and sizes. They are the best."
"Returning these. Some bright person put a label on plasticware, and these don't peel off, so now there is sticky residue that will grab dirt. GROSS. Whose bright idea was that? I've ordered many of these, and NO ONE ELSE put a non-removable label on it. Now my NEW product is OLD. When you buy a crystal clear storage container for food, you want it to appear CLEAN."
"This is my second one and I love them. Crystal clear, leak proof, and airtight. At first the side clamps seemed a bit difficult for both visitors and myself but one quickly adapts. I use it for leftovers and refrigerator salads, as well as cakes and cookies. I can‚Äôt get enough of them and am keeping my eyes open for new deals. Highly recommended!"
"These containers are fabulous to store cigars in, alongside of a Boveda pack. However, they are a little small. Not that they don‚Äôt hold plenty of sticks, but that if they were twice the size, you could also introduce some spanish cedar trays and spread your cigars out a little. All in all, they were a great starter for me until I upsized. Only problem, I have two containers now just sitting empty. Guess I can use them for food."
"Needed something that could seal out water if placed on a rack in a cooler should the melted ice water get splashed around or the need arise to set a container directly on the ice. These really seal. As soon as I got them, I filled them with water, sealed the lids, turned them upside down on the counter & left them overnight to see if they could keep water IN (which would mean they could also keep water out). No a drop escaped.  Now, I don't know how long the inner seal will actually last. But I think with good care & not using water that's scalding to clean them, it should last a good long time.  They stack very nicely also in different sizes.  They do scratch a bit on the outside."
"I like this size of container. I have a Tupperware brand which is about the same size, and I need a new one because of the cracked cover. Have been looking all over to find this size, and finally I found this Rubbermaid. I use it for putting the Graham Crackers in it and also dry spaghetti noodles. The noodles doesn't quite fit (leftover from the other Tupperware container), but I manage to lay it in diagonally (corner to corner). Not sure if I'll be able to put a whole box of noodles in it, if not I can still use it for something else, and buy another kind of container for the dry spaghetti noodles."
"This line from Rubbemaid is absolutely fantastic! I have never been this excited about plastic food storage. It stores beautifully with food in the fridge and empty in my cabinets. They do not stain-even tomato sauces, they have kept my fruit and vegetables fresher longer. They are practical and can go in the microwave and dishwasher. I truly have thrown everything else away and completely switched to these. The smaller sizes work well for kids lunches too."
"I use it as a cigar humidor. I was using a jar before but didn't like my cigars resting on their foot. Also, this seal is way better. I have 30 cigars in one and 25 in the other because of longer Churchill cigars. I recommend adding a strip of cedar to the bottom of the humidor."
"These containers are sturdy, airtight, and are stackable. I have bought various sizes and it makes finding baking items and all the different types of rice I have, very easy. I purchased Avery labels that are removable to label in the containers."
"As the name suggests the plastic finish is high gloss. More importantly the clarity of the plastic is outstanding. Easy of lid fastening is great. Resistance to long microwave times is excellent. Resistance to lid deformation when removing from microwave oven after long heating is excellent. Lid seals release when excessive pressure is present but you notice since they pop up. While cost for Brilliance series is at the upper end, their performance warrants it."
"I love is a little container. It's leak-proof, durable and stylish. It's pretty easy to clean as well my only issue is that the handles on it require a little ingenuity when it comes to cleaning but if you have a dish brush, is nothing but a simple swipe or two across inside the handle to make sure that it's clean and sanitary. Other than that this container is perfect and I will be purchasing more."
"I bought one of these when they first came out , like 10 years ago.. before that they had a 'stainmaster' one that was also crystalline plastic that was incredibly durable , did not stain, very scratch resistant.. These are the Ultimate new generation of those Great sealed containers."
"I bought these hoping to seal in the odor of the stinky vegetables that I steam once a week. The odor bothers my wife, so I steam them when she is away and then seal them in this container. It does a good job of keeping the odor contained. I like the locking clips and the ultra-clear material. I may buy a second one because I should be able to one on top of the other on one shelf of the fridge."
"Bought a set but found this larger size in demand more often than not so got several more of just this size, bacon, cheeses, etc are all constant users of these units. We recently started using these for freezer storage of left over pizza, so far so good, no problems as yet."
Made in USA! This product has a multitude of uses for the home. I am a gardener and use the container to store my dry chemicals in garage.  I store my dogs' medicine - no chance of chewing into the a container  Love this specific container for storage of multitude of kitchen spices
"On a whim I bought a set of these containers for my son's new apartment. They really seal and are easy to clean. So then I bought some for myself. I stopped using the odd collection of deli containers, left overs from dinner at a restaurant containers, and the inevitable mismatched lids. Finally, I did the Kondo clean and all these odd items that did not bring me joy, landed in the recycle, repurpose bin and only these Brilliance Food Storage Containers, in a few assorted sizes are in my cabinet. They do what they are supposed to, they look great, and I have so much new found space now that all the other stuff is gone."
"I use this to store prepared salad greens and occasionally to prep sandwich fixings for a lunch crowd. The tight seal lids keep the greens in good condition in the refrigerator for about 5 days, which means less prepping time. In the summer, when I make more main dish salads, I can see this getting even more use. It's also very to clean, top rack safe for the DW. This is a good, versatile size."
Better than I expected. I purchased two of these to use as tupperdores for my cigars. I added spanish cedar to the bottom and used Boveda packets with some digital hygrometers. I got everything here on Amazon. It works PERFECT! Very happy. Thank you!
This is the perfect container to store Insulin Pens in the refrigerator. It is strong enough to put other items on top of it if you have limited space. It is very easy to remove the lid. It is easy to see in the container to keep track of how much insulin is left. This container is perfect for this issue!
"Honestly, this is the best container I've ever used. Not sure about how it is with liquids, but with dry food it works great. I needed a large air-proof container after a food bag broke to keep out weevils and preserve the freshness of my food. This has done the trick and it's really satisfying to hear the air being pushed out of it as you press down and create a seal."
"These containers are great. I am very surprised at the length of time in the fridge that food seems to stay ‚Äòfresh‚Äô. The seal is GREAT, no issues at all. Just push down in the center a little, and close the flaps. The rubber seal does the rest. They are dishwasher safe, and clean up nicely. They are great for organization in the fridge, stack beautifully. I‚Äôve ordered several different sizes. I mostly use them for fresh cut, picked, or purchased fruit and vegetables."
"I love so many things about these containers that I hardly know where to begin! They take up little space in my cabinets. They stack so nicely in my freezer and refrigerator. They don‚Äôt leak, they don‚Äôt hold odors, you can clearly see what‚Äôs inside them. I can use them in the microwave without fear of shrinking or warping. They fit in my apartment size dishwasher. They do not break when I drop them on my concrete floor."
"I have several Brilliance containers. They are a staple in my pantry. I love how well the lids attach. They are airtight and leakproof. Also, if you happened to drop one of them on the floor, the lid would stay on and you wouldn't have a big mess to clean. Ideal for camping, also. No danger of something in the kitchen of your travel trailer tipping over and spilling while traveling."
I love these food storage containers. The refrigerator is much more organized. The food can be seen so you don't have to open up other containers to see what is inside. We continue to purchase more because we found out how much we love them. If you happen to tip one over the liquid does not come out. The seal is so perfect. I take olives in the small container to dialysis to help me with the cramping. I don't have to worry about the juice spilling all over me. I love the different sizes.
Loving this for my cigars. Holds everything in WELL. LOW maintenance. Another one on the way.
"I loved this so much I purchased 3 more. Stores food air tight, I purchased to store my Christmas cookies and it works perfect. I would highly recommend."
"these are nice containers, but kind of expensive when you have to buy one at a time. only thing I could find that fit my RV s entertainment storage area. higher quality and heavier than I need, but I can see them lasting a long time."
"These are fantastic. The plastic is great crystal clear quality. It‚Äôs thicker harder plastic that doesn‚Äôt feel cheaper or bend easily. I use them for meal prepping and storage of leftovers and the lids seal very very well. I also like the feature that when you put them in the microwave, all you have to do is pop up the lock down tabs and there is a small hole to release steam and pressure without removing the lid"
"I will never buy anything else but these Rubbermaid storage containers for my use. They're the best! My only gripe would be, when buying the big sets you get WAY more of the teeny tiny containers than the bigger ones. I had to order two extra big containers."
I have 2 of these and use them as humidor for my cigars. I bought cheap Spanish cedar strips to add inside for smell and humidity control. Works great!
"Works perfectly as an airtight cigar humidor with a Boveda humidifier and a hydrometer. Just add your cigars. Also, it almost looks like fine clear glass, a handsome if utilitarian display box."
"These are great containers for storing food. Even freezing. Can use in a microwave. Seals flawlessly. Well made. Dishwasher safe. Very impressed by these leak proof, air tight, easy to clean containers. Comes in various sizes too."
I use these along with sheets of Spanish Cedar and humidification packs to store my cigars. They work great and look nice too.
These new Rubbermaid Brilliance containers are the best I have found. Truly air and liquid tight. They are inexpensive enough to own a lot of them to store everything you want. My one tip is that even though they are ‚Äúdishwasher safe‚Äù you should hand wash them for a long life. Repeated runs through a dishwasher with that extremely hot water is what usually breaks down the sealable containers.
"I bought a set of these and have been enjoying them, they seal very good with the gasket and have latches to keep the lid down firmly. I bought 2 of these to go with the set so I could use the extras as a tupperdor. It works great for food and as a tupperdor, but not at the same time!  Well worth the purchase, I'm looking at getting some other sizes to fill the gaps with other stuff I need sealed up good."
My own Rubbermaid container took on stains every time I put food in it so I replaced it with this new container which looks like Pyrex glass but is not. It resists stains and looks nicer. So glad I made this purchase.
"Using this container as a cigar humidor... My opinion is that this product works better than an Acrylic Humidor, with a far better seal... Holds R/H to perfection, whether using Boveda Pack or Humidor Beads..."
"If you are a cigar guy or gal, and don‚Äôt want the headache of dealing with a humidor, this is for you! It will hold 20-30 cigars, depending on size, and all you need is a 69% Boveda pack and a cheap digital hygrometer. It moves very little from 70 degrees and 70% humidity. I did a 2 week average on it checking it twice a day for 14 days and the mean was 69.7 degrees and 69.9% humidity. No seasoning and waiting, no filling with distilled water. Nope....throw in your Boveda and sticks, close it up, and you‚Äôre done. Seal is amazing and does everything a 2-3 hundred dollar Spanish cedar humidor will do without hassle."
"Like most people, I had a cabinet full of mismatched, assorted plastic food storage containers. I purchased two of these, and was so Impressed and Thrilled with the quality, I immediately ordered an assortment of all sizes. All others went into the recycle bin and these are the only ones we use now."
"1. These are a little difficult to unpack. They are tightly stacked inside one another. After struggling for a few minutes and feeling like a bit of a weakling, I discovered that if you squeeze the top container at the top a bit, it releases the suction created by such tight packing, and will slide right out! Once i figured that out it was fine! 2. As other reviewers have noted, some of the containers appear scuffed, (probably due to the tight packing). This does not bother me, but it may bother others. 3. These are not crystal clear as pictured. They are still transparent, and they come with labels, so it's not a deal breaker. 4. Airtight, (I think) . When i was washing these before use, i tested a few of them to make sure water didn't leak out and they did great. I just spent 2 days attempting to eradicate pantry moths, so it is important nothing can get in or out in case i missed any larva or eggs. (Sorry, a little gross). I assume if water won't leak in or out, neither will the moths. 5. Size. Even though the product dimensions are shown, these certainly appear smaller than the pictures. I had to order some extra containers for cereal after discovering the largest of containers will likely not fit a full or family sized box of cereal. I'm sure i will use all of these, but I expected larger volume on some of these. It would be nice if they gave measurements (maybe in cups? ) for dry goods, since it appears that most of us will probably use these for such. Overall i like these. They seem sturdy and they will certainly aid in the organization of my pantry after dealing with the moths."
"Very nice containers! I chose these over one of the ""best seller"" recommendations on Amazon, primarily due to these being BPA-free (yes, read descriptions on some of the other brands..they are NOT all BPA-free). These aren't crystal clear BUT they aren't as frosted looking as I expected from some of the reviews. Each were individually wrapped so none were scratched or damaged in any way. I love that the lids all fit the same ~ no having to figure out which lid goes with which container!"
"The is a truly excellent product. It is exactly what I needed to organize my pantry. My family loves that the lids are much easier to open than traditional plastic storage containers. All the lids fit perfectly and securely and are interchangeable so no more digging for the right lid. I highly recommend this product. Reminder: These containers are for DRY STORAGE. If this is what you need, this is your product."

"After months of drilling over beautifully organized pantries, my husband said I should pick out containers and have fun. I searched and searched for the best options, and I love the results! My pantry is now fabulous. The kids are a bit difficult to unsnap, but it‚Äôs a good trade off for freshness. I actually found I needed more smaller containers, even though I didn‚Äôt think I would use any of them when I first ordered! They stack the best and hold a bag of beans or chocolate chips."
My wife went on a cleaning spree after watching some organizing shows on Netflix and she needed something like this. A lot of options out there but these fit what we needed. Definitely recommended. They even have labels. Keep bugs/ants away and everything fresh and easy to identify.
"I ordered sets of containers to organize the pantry only to find that they are NOT transparent. I prefer having transparent containers for pantry organization.  PROS: Sturdy, good quality, airtight lids, the different sizes allow for easy organization.  Cons: Not transparent"
"I have a problem with ants in my pantry. No more after I bought this set! They are real easy to use. Easy to see what's inside and stay airtight with just four little clicks. My spices for making Curry no longer smell up the whole kitchen. But when I open them it's all there in all its Glory. Spices like bay leaves and Dill look and smell much fresher being sealed in these containers, better than any I used before."
"These are perfect for pantry staples. I purchased for my camper pantry. They work perfectly. I love that they are rectangular and not round. Works much better with limited space like a camper! No worries about anything getting into my stuff. I put staples like flour, sugar, salt, etc. plus all our snacks, crackers snd cereal!  Buy them you won‚Äôt be disappointed!! Also love the labels and chalk pen to mark everything!"
The key to these storage containers is that they all have the same footprint and same size lids. They are just different heights. I got all my baking staples in them and they take up less space because they are all the same width and length. Only caveat is don't put the lids in the dishwasher. I have all dry goods in mine so I don't need to wash them often. Great solution to organizing that cupboard or pantry.
"We were having issues with pantry moths big time and bought these to help alleviate the problem by keeping everything in sturdy, airtight containers. So far we like these as they seem to do the job and they fit in our kitchen well, which does not have a lot of space. My favorite feature is that all the lids are interchangeable, and everything stacks together nicely, even on top of some of the larger bins that we purchased separately from the same company. Overall, very pleased so far!"
They are exactly as they are described! Love looking inside my pantry and smiling. Bought another set of containers for baking cabinet
"Love love love these came nicely packaged! Nothing was cracked or broken yay for me lol..Very sturdy and well made.Second picture is the chaos of my small pantry, third picture is with my new containers nice and organized I will definitely buy more."
"These match the Cereal containers that I bought previously and are stackable, so use all of the space available on my shelves wisely! The lids snap close on all 4 sides and are air-tight. They are also very affordable vs the container store or trying to find matches in Marshall's and Home Good's. Love them~! Great product and great deal, at a great price!"
"Love these little containers! The small size is perfect for storing a small amounts of ingredients near the stove. It saves me from having to pull out my big canisters from the pantry when I just need a spoonful of sugar or flour for a quick recipe. Just pay attention to the sizes! Most of the people with complaints need to learn to read, lol. These also are a perfect match to my large size containers in my pantry. Highly recommend."
"Here in the south moisture gets everything and bugs can‚Äôt be avoided. These containers seal very tight, stack nicely, and preserve all my staples. I have two sets and literally transfer everything I bring home into these."
"Very pleased with these containers. Very sturdy with thick construction and tight-fitting lids. Nice labels included with white pen which was definitely a bonus (I didn't realize they came with). I actually bought two of these and then some bigger ones that will hold 5 pound bags of flour, etc."
I am a big fan of keep my food in containers. In these containers I can see what is in them and how much is left at a glance. My shelves look neat and I am also able to stack these containers. My dry goods are safer in these containers in case during cold weather some mice happen to take refuge in your home. Cleaning them is a breeze.
"I got these for my mom, but ended up using them more myself. They close and open relitively easy and I found them very useful. I love the fact the tallest ones can fit full sized lasgnia pasta and spagetti!  Just as a caution that while they can stack, you can have some trouble pulling them back apart if you stick them in too hard."
I needed canisters for my kitchen. These are see thru and come with stickers and a pen to write the contents on. Love the 4 sided snap on lids. I will probably buy more.
This product seems to fit the purpose of the purchase. My food is stored in leak proof containers that keep bugs and mice away. You can easily see what is inside
I love these and thank you so much.. but I didnt get get any of the tall ones tall enough for dry spaghetti etc. Its fine though. *UPDATE...I DID GET EVERY PIECE DESCRIBED!! JUST OVERLOOKED IT. MY APOLOGIES. THANKS SO MUCH I LOVE THEM. THEY ARE VERY STURDY AND EASY TO CLEAN. WILL BE BUYING MORE. THANKS AGAIN.
"These are good containers. Easy to clean, air tight storage. They aren't as clear as my more expensive containers but that‚Äôs expected for the price."
I have a bit of a problem when it comes to wanting all things organized and these wonderful containers are just what I was looking for. They are perfect in size for the variety of things I keep in my pantry and they look sharp! I will actually be purchasing more in the future!
These are perfect for keeping my dry goods organized and neatly stored. They are not completely transparent but it‚Äôs easy enough to see what‚Äôs inside. I highly recommend.
Ordered theses to organize my pantry; containers are of very good quality. The seal keeps foods fresh. The package comes with labels and a white marker ( you can wipe off the label and change the content if needed). I‚Äôve already purchased another set to finish my organization.
We had a pantry invasion of moths and basically cleared out our pantry and got this set. Extremely pleased with the variety of sizes. The lids are all interchangeable so easy for storage. Stacks beautifully and you can clearly see what‚Äôs inside. No more moths either!
"I love these containers. Very sturdy, easy to clean, the lids snap on secure, I just can't say enough. The amount was great - in fact I didn't even use all of them. Great for organizing your cabinets, or the pantry and they look GREAT. A great value. I highly recommend these."
"Great for pastas, beans, snacks, cereal, etc. Keeps them fresh and organized. No odor and tops fit tightly. I love the way the tops snap on. Think I will purchase more for myself and daughters. Great for organizing."
Perplexed by all the negative reviews saying containers aren't clear. Loved all the various sizes - great buy!
These are absolutely perfect for keeping dry goods fresh and organized in the cupboards. I got so tired of my noodles escaping the plastic bags they came in since they would slide off of each other and rip the bags open in the cupboards. I get so many compliments on how nice these are .
"I had previously purchased containers because they were lower priced. They had lids that had a spring and you could push the handle forward and backward. Within a year, the lids were broken and the containers cracked. I purchased the and they are amazing. Well worth the money for the quality you get. They were a little hard to separate at first. I love them and plan to order another set"
"I had no problems with these. They were everything I had hoped for. Good, sturdy containers with a tight seal. Perfect to organize my pantry. The labels made these even better. I highly recommend them!"
"These storage containers are sturdy. The lids fit tight. And the containers are clear enough to know what and how much of dry product you have without the labels. Now items such as flour, powdered sugar, cornstarch, etc, should be labeled."
"The product was delivered very timely. I washed and dried the containers and put my pantry items in them. Now, my pantry is well organized, no more odd containers or plastic bags. The containers and lids are easy to clean, appear to be durable. Best part is one size lids fit on all the different sized containers."
I have a small pantry so these types of containers are perfect for my shelves and for saving space. Will purchase again.
Loved the variety of sizes. I‚Äôve bought several sets and reorganized my entire pantry.  Sizes coincide with store packaging sizes pretty well. Once you figure out what to put in each one it‚Äôs very easy to see what you have and stay well stocked but not over stocked.
Love them! I have a small pantry and the various sizes allowed me to stack them and save space. 2as super excited when I realized it came with a white chalk marker.
I‚Äôm so glad I purchased this. Good quality containers and definitely helps a lot the pantry look.
I used these in my pantry. I love that they are easy to use and they make it look clean
Our pantry needed a space saving product that would last and conserve space while keeping fresh food as well.
"Item delivered on time and as expected. Great containers, perfect for organizing and prolonging the shelf life of your stored items."
"Love.... love these products. I was very tired of chip bags tearing when opened and of course my special daughter with autism, would leave the bags open. I am glad I took the plunge. Love an organized pantry."
"I love these containers! They are awesome! The lids are great! They are easy for my children whom are younger to access on their own, and they keep good fresh!"
Just got these in today and filled them right up! Super convenient to have. Made my pantry look so much better. Love that it came in different sizes and with its own labels
"No complaints here. I washed the containers in the dishwasher and hand washed the lids, the seal came out easily with the use of a butter knife. Really helped to organize my pantry!"
"These are sturdy, and air tight. Labels or no labels they are prefect for displaying you beans, pasta or crafting materials."
It look beautiful in my pantry! They are delicate but strong at the same time! Definitely you can buy it because it worth every penny! The best part? I can do the stickers by myself!
I love these. I don‚Äôt know what I did before I had them. I will be buying another set of them. My pantry looks so awesome now.
I love it... they make my pantry look great and easy to wash... also can really quick... would recommend
I was thinking where to store these containers when I order them. But when received them I realize how easy to store and easy fit in my kitchen. I like the variety options comes with. Specially the labels and marker are good nice. I highly recommend them.
What I especially like is the one size lids so there is no guessing on what lids fit what size container!
"These containers are amazing. They really are airtight and keep food fresh. Additionally, they hold a lot and are great space savers. I would buy this again and gift it as well!"
"these are great for organizing . and i love that they come with labeles that you can write on , makes it look nicer.."
"These containers are durable, easy, and make a very disorganized pantry very organized and clean"
I originally bought these to organize / air tight my pantry. But before I used them for that - I found myself using them for everything else!  Tonight I officially used them for my pantry and will be ordering a second set for all the other things I love putting in them!
"These container are the best study, stores well in the cabinet , easy to clean and air tight. Great price and various sizes. A really good buy."
"Have not had the opportunity to use them yet, but based on appearance and feel, they look to be very nice."
Love how they keep everything fresh. Easy to stack and keep organized.
Very convenient. My fridge is full of them.
As good as advertised
Lids fit well. Containers come in various sizes which is nice. I was worried the plastic would be too thin but they are sturdy. Easy to wash.
Love them . Keeps our coffees completely fresh. I would definitely buy these again
Just what I needed.
Lots of containers for the money. Good quality.
Since I‚Äôm an organization freak I bought several of these and my pantry is clean neat and organized. I love them
"Exactly what is pictured. Items seem very sturdy and the lids fit really nicely so no worries about leaking! I wish there were more of the larger size containers in the package versus the smaller, but it‚Äôs still a great buy!"
Love these containers. They work really well and seal nicely. Nice thick plastic with rubber seal. I used almost all of them on the first day!
"I purchased a larger set from another seller and then decided to purchase this one, because i needed more containers. This set is much more thicker and the tight seal was greattttt. I also love the locking mechanism! Love it !!!! and great price."
Amazing storage containers love them will definitely buy more
"I bought this at the beginning of April last year and then have been using them for my daily lunch to my office and storage purpose at my residence. I bought them to freeze single or double-serving amounts of things like homemade tomato sauce after I make a huge batch, so ‚Äúsmall‚Äù containers are exactly what I wanted... bigger is not better in all cases but I use those bigger ones on my lunch prep.  Aesthetically these are ideal for my kitchen because they don't have any obnoxious colours (personal preference, others might disagree). The only thing that could be improved would be to add at least one larger container to the collection. Overall nice product though and hard to beat the price. Pros 1. Hard to beat the price 2. Nice colours 3. Too many size choices 4. Easy to clean them  Cons They break easily if they slip from your hand even at 1 feet height."
"My wife and I have been using these for a couple of weeks now, and we're very pleased with the construction and performance of the containers. The glass is thick, but very clear, making it easy to see what's inside. I've banged them around quite a bit, and dropped one of the larger ones off the counter on to the floor, and they're still good as new. No scratches or cracks.  The lids seal tight, and the clamping of the lid to the container is easy. Much better than some of the plastic containers we own, where one or two of the sides won't clamp because the container itself is weak or has warped. The product information that came with the containers said do not cook in the oven or microwave the containers with the lids on them, and I can see why - the silicone seal is very soft. It's great for sealing, but not for microwaving. You really shouldn't be cooling things with the lids on containers anyway, it's dangerous. That's what pressure cookers are for.  The containers stack neatly together and are bulky, but easy to store.  We're definitely going to get another set and get rid of some of our plastic containers."
I absolutely love this set!! I've been trying to get rid of all my plastic Tupperware just because I work and heat alot of my food in the microwave and I know it's not very good for your health.  I like this set because it comes in different sizes and its leak proof and don't have to worry about making a mess in my lunch bag and best of all it's so easy to clean. would totally recommend it plus it's really cheap considering it's a 12 piece and glass!
I absolutely love these containers. First off their packaging is so nice. I love love love the personalization and personal touch with the added thank you note. It helps to know that the people selling you products cares. For me it shows that they also probably care about their products. I've been using these for over a week now and hand no complaints. I love the glass containers as I can easily heat up in the microwave without transferring to another container. The plastic lids are perfect and snap on easily. So far I have had no leaks. The varying sizes are nice too. I can put pasta and sauces in separate containers. They are a bit heavy because of the glass but that is expected. I highly recommend these containers if you're looking for storage containers. I wouldn't recommend for meal prep though.
"My daughter is moving out on her own. I am putting together a moving out kit. She asked for something with snap like lid containers. I dicided I was not going to get her plastic, it doesnt have the same abilities as glass. With these they can be dishwasher, oven, microwave and freezer safe, lids of course can only go in the freezer, not the oven, microwave or dishwasher. Which is a huge selling point for me. I want her to be able to use it for just than storing food, but cooking too. There is 3 different styles, round, square, and rectangle with 3 sizes of each. This will give her more options. The glass is clear so she can see through it to see what she has inside them. The lids are a light color, but cannot see through them. They have the seal to keep the food airtight once the lids are locked in place."
"Not good quality-- a glass shard broke off and ended up in food.  We had the dishes for a month, and used them sparingly. The rim of one of the smaller dishes broke and a small glass shard ended up in one of the bigger dishes during storage. We didn't find it until my wife ate food and felt the glass shard in her mouth.  The price is good and the dish seem good, but how durable and safe are they actually? I hate leaving negative reviews but a glass shard in food justifies the one star. Beware of them."
"I‚Äôve had my containers for a few days only. Most of them not even used. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how gentle I have been with these items. I went to grab one out of the cabinet that was nested with others, and when I grabbed it, I heard something fall to the ground. I looked at the ground but couldn‚Äôt see anything, so I bent down and there was glass shards. I hadn‚Äôt even used this container yet. Thank God I heard that glass drop, and thank God I decided to check the floor out. I would have never of known there was a chipped edge from one container that dropped into another. I would show pictures, but I am too tired from having to wet towels and graze the floor to pick up any slivers of glass. I only went to this company after seeing the many bad reviews on Pyrex glassware, but I have a Pyrex bowl that has lasted through every possible scenario you can imagine. I‚Äôll be taking my money back to Pyrex. I changed my mind, I decided to show pictures so people would know to be careful. This is how tiny the glass was that broke off, which makes it more dangerous. Pink pen shows the glass shards, and yellow pen shows the chip. Be careful people."

"This is a 24 piece set for $34. I'm happy with the price. What really surprised me was how heavy and sturdy the glass feels on this. So much so that I was able to bake mini cakes for my toddler in them. She was so happy. They are also very easy to clean. I just remove the silicone seal and place it on the top rack of the dishwasher and it's easy to put back in.  I bought this set because I was looking for something practical to pack my husband's lunch in. He's usually gone for a few days at a time. These containers keep his food clean and they close so well, I haven't had to worry about leaks. They are also a great size for the food portions I give him. I've also been using these containers for some of my daughter's snacks. I've noticed that they stay fresh, and also she's able to open and close them without my help, which is a huge plus for me.  It's extra work to take off and on the seal sometimes. I'm a little concerned I'll lose it. But it's ok because I still have the ability to pop it in the dishwasher this way."
"I was looking for some small glass containers to bring snacks and pack for lunches and these are perfect! I also got a lot of sizes for a good price.  The smallest sizes are good for packing yogurt, or dessert, or small amounts of leftovers for lunch. What‚Äôs great is they are leakproof and you can heat up the leftovers in the microwave.  I used the medium and large size for leftovers in the fridge.  I‚Äôd say the largest size could be used as a meal prep container, if you‚Äôre into meal prepping. You get 3 large containers that are different shapes (round, square, rectangle).  I love how the tops lock down to give a solid, airtight seal. I have some other brand where the tops don‚Äôt lock and I‚Äôve had leaking issues. I have actually dropped these containers (with soup inside) and they did not break and the top did not fly off. Phew!  The glass is really nice and solid. The tops are thick and made well. I did not notice any odor when I unpacked the set. Everything was wrapped nicely so it wouldn‚Äôt break.  If you‚Äôre looking for a set of smaller glass containers, I recommend this set."
"UPDATE: August 15, 2019 - I changed my review for two very good reasons. The FIRST is because the glass containers that didn‚Äôt break are AMAZING! I use them to cook small meals in my toaster oven. I then let them cool to put the lids on and then put them right into the FREEZER!! Then when I‚Äôm ready, I remove the container from freezer and put it in the refrigerator to thaw and reheat in microwave when ready to use the food inside. These are amazingly durable!!  The SECOND reason I updated my review is because the company reached out to me and provided me a completely new set. No defects in them!! It was determined that the set I received had been flawed/defective in the production process because they shouldn‚Äôt have broken upon hot water hand washing. I am so glad I gave this product a second chance and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to anyone, especially people who live alone or are a couple, or even want to take lunches to work/school in durable glass, non-stainable containers unlike plastic food storage containers.  Original review: please take my original review as that of the product being defective. I didn‚Äôt delete it because I want everyone to realize that THIS COMPANY STANDS FULLY AND COMPLETELY BEHIND ITS PRODUCT!!! I do not own a dish a dishwasher. More than half of the dishes broke as I was washing them for the first time in the sink. It was so frustrating because they broke in big chunks with shards of glass all over"
"These are wonderful! Exactly what I was looking for. All of my old plastic refrigerator storage containers were looking pretty rough. I didn't want to just buy another set of plastic containers because they just don't work well in the microwave. I keep forgetting if I have something with tomatoes or turmeric, zapping in the microwave will ruin the plastic container. This set has a good selection of sizes. The lids take some practice lining up to get a seal, but they work well. Even though the user manual recommends you wash the lids by hand, or at least remove the gasket before putting them in the dishwasher, I have had no trouble washing the lids on the upper rack of my dishwasher. An added benefit to using glass over plastic - I can see my leftovers without having to open the container first. It seems like I will be less likely to forget I have something."
"Plastic is harmful to human health, correction its for all living organism, especially when heated in microwave overtime it will start to release chemicals in your food and I am very conscious of health, THIS is the particular reason I started looking for GLASS CONTAINERS for storing my food, for lunch and reheating purpose.  I was looking for a good deal on the GLASS CONTAINER sets, as I required multiple size containers for various storage needs. I stumbled upon this which had some clip-on coupon which gave me a discount. This container came with 24 different sized glass container, which is more than I expected especially because of the different sizes it comes in.  When I received the box and opened it I saw a very sweet thank you note from the seller, this kind of things make customers happier and make them feel more valued, the box was neatly packed in styrofoam to prevent breakage.  All the glass containers are leaking proof tested it myself, taking my lunch every day to the office no leaks and easy to clean as well.  To all the persons who are health conscious and looking for a safe option to store food and carry lunch, this is the right option, this seller values the customer and makes them feel important."
"I wanted some glass dishes with varying sizes that could go from freezer to microwave for easy meal prep. This are wonderful! The smaller ones are perfect for an individual portion size, so I make a bigger original batch and freeze them for days I do not feel like cooking for myself and just grab one and pop in into the microwave! They are well made, sturdy glass dishes and the lids are a stronger plastic (I have had other snap on lidded dishes and the hinges are weak and break after too many times in the freezer) and I feel the hinges will not break very easily (but only time will tell on that). I have used them a lot in the short time I have had them and they clean easily (I do not have a dishwasher so do all my dishes by hand), store nicely (stack inside each other) and work perfect for easy meal prep! Very happy I chose these dishes!"
"Tired of stained, plastic storage containers that eventually get thrown out, I decided to purchase glass storage containers once and for all. This was a great set! The color of the silicone seal matches perfectly with my mint kitchen theme, and the quality is perfect, too. I have put the lids in the dishwasher multiple times and they have been fine, no distortion at all. I use these for packing lunches and storing leftovers. I have yet to have a leakage problem. I use these containers so often that I now have two sets so I always have different sizes at hand whenever I need them. You won't be disappointed with these!"
"I have purchased this product twice now as I've lost some containers over time to drops. To be clear, these are glass, so they will shatter. Don't assume they won't or they're somehow shock resistant, they are not. The point of borosilicate glass is to protect against thermal shock. So pouring boiling liquid into a thick, room temperature container, won't cause it to shatter. You can take a container out of the fridge, straight in to a microwave and take the contents to boiling hot (or hotter for oil), without having it explode or shatter due to the uneven expansion of the glass.  The tops fit very well as long as you seat them correctly. Because it clasps in 4 points, sometimes, it will be a little off in one of the two directions. You just need to unclip and adjust. When seated correctly, it will seal airtight. Many times, I take these out of the fridge and the cooling has created a vacuum and makes removing the lid a bit difficult. This is a good thing.  So far, the only plastic parts, the lids, have not warped or stained, despite covering lots of dark, acidic foods, like chili or sauce, so good marks for that as well.  FYI, afaik, be aware that Pyrex (single capital P) is a US trademarked name and is no longer owned and made by Corning Glass. Almost all current Pyrex products are no longer borosilicate. PYREX (all caps) and pyrex (all lower case) are foreign and are still borosilicate, to the best of my knowledge."
"Love these dishes! I am in love with them! I made this purchase to swap out my plastic containers and they did not disappoint! This product had good reviews at an affordable price for the number of containers received! Definitely got my money's worth and I would super highly recommend them. When I first received these dishes it had a strong plastic smell but some soapy water did the trick and also some kids seemed like they weren't gonna be tight or that they would leak but nope! It's all good! No leaks, no smells, no stains! I just wish it had labels or some sort of writing to let me know if they are freezer microwave/oven safe or the size of the container but other than it, they are perfect for my husband's lunch and for storing food in my fridge! I use them for meal prep and for storing! Different sizes are very convenient, just wish it would include a long rectangle or bigger size but it's ok I am still in love with this set of glass containers! Very well packaged and even included a little thank you calander üíï thank you so much for such an excellent product and great customer service üíï"
"I love these containers. Only had them a few weeks so I don't know about the long term durability but they seem solid.  When I first got them I thought there's no way they're leakproof based on the way the rubber lid lining fits on the container, but I've used them a few times to marinate and none of the liquid leaked out when I vigorously shook it around.  There is a little indent in the lid that allows the lining to be removed easily.  I only wish they sold individuals if each size because it would be nice to have more of the 14oz rectangle containers."
"I love these, I love the look of these, they have a lot of great different sizes, but you can‚Äôt stack them very well. Also, I‚Äôve had a few difficult times closing the lids, but I‚Äôm always able to. It‚Äôs the rubber ring that‚Äôs kind of a pain. It comes off you just got a put it back on and it is part of the problem they‚Äôre difficult to close all the way sometimes. However they are leakproof because of it, and it makes him look super cute with that extra color pop."
"Like so many others I decided to switch from plastic to glass. A friend recommended these and I couldn't be happier. Love the aqua color and the thickness of the glass. Each lid has snapped on securely with no chance of slippage.. No discoloration of plastic, no residue which you know comes from previous contents not being all the way cleaned off. I will be ordering another set."
"Pros: easy to clean - I love how you don't have to claw out and ruin the blue silicone seal thanks to the design of the lid which has a finger-width divot to grip, hold, and pull the silicone out. Better than plastic tupperware which absorbs smells; one day I can hold pickled vegetables and, after a wash the next day, I can put fruit in the same container without worrying about a smelly vinegar taste while eating my fruit. Easy to use these containers in the freezer with freshly chopped vegetables to make a meal later in the week.  New habit: heating foods in this container in the microwave without the lid on.  Cons: one of the silicone seals was not ""glued"" intact. I don't like how this tupperware was stored/came to me with so much plastic wrap around each container -- they could have used more eco-friendly methods of packaging these containers, like with newspaper or recycled paper."
"I love these. I was looking for glass containers with lids that snapped down on a silicon seal. These have been excellent. I always have several in the fridge storing food and have yet to experience a leak of any type with any of them. I have granite countertops so it is very easy to set them down too hard and cringe, expecting the worse. No chips or breaks on any of them.  In fact, I use them so regularly I got rid of all of my Tupperware plastic bowls to free up cabinet space! There is a good selection to the sizes in this pack and I typically am able to choose a bowl that is the perfect size for whatever I am needing to store in them."
"These lovely little organizers are the best. As soon as I clean my produce I reach for these. I always prep my salad mix-ins ahead of time. They keep food fresher longer and there is no spill to clean up later. The variety of sizes is a huge help and they stack up well in the fridge. Because they are made of glass, I can see what is inside right away. The tops are snug fitting and I chose the blue ones to match my kitchen. I love these containers so much I already bought a second set for more food prepping. Thanks Amazon!"
"Very impressed with this product upon removing from packaging. I will preface this review with the fact that I‚Äôve just started using this, but am loving it thus far. They are very attractive and it‚Äôs super easy to see your food item. Llids seem to form a great seal and I really like the ‚Äúlever‚Äù action of being able to essentially clip the lid off and on the bowl very easily. The glass seems to be relatively thick but maybe not quite as thick as Corning wear, but seems durable. They stack well. Will update in about one month because I am considering investing in more for my daughter."
"These bowls are the greatest. I have had it with plastic bowls that pit and discolor. So I thought I would try these. Just like everyone else I was amazed with the packaging. They arrived in perfect order. The next hurdle was ""how well would they work?"" They were easy to seal, they stacked well in the fridge, they didn't leak and were easy to clean. I love that you can see what is in each one without taking the lid off, and that the gasket is so easy to remove and clean. I feel really good about using them. I will be ordering more."
"I have a set of Pyrex containers that I've loved for years, and when my mom mentioned that she wanted to buy a set for herself I decided to get them as a mother's day gift. After some research I found these Bayco containers. We've been using them since Mother's Day, so roughly a month now? The fridge is slam full of these guys. The variety of sizes are perfect, we waste considerably less food than before since we have a perfect size container for any leftovers! Like another review mentioned, the snap lids are very easy to open and close which is wonderful for my mom's arthritis (and everyone else-- I can't be the only one that hates getting a nail caught trying to wrestle a snap container open. yeah, I know you shuddered on that one). The glass is dishwasher safe, and the lids are very easy to clean (try to remember to take out the little rubber lip and clean that too, I imagine it can get gross under there if ignored for a while). The glass being oven and microwave safe is incredibly convenient. One of the main reasons I love my Pyrex is that I can eat out of the dish I baked in and cut down how many dishes I use. These Bayco dishes are just as durable and I use them in the same fashion. The company has emailed me about 3 times to make sure everything has gone well, and that's awesome! The email I got today is what made me write this-- I've been meaning to leave a review but kept forgetting. If anything had gone wrong it would've been very easy to get in contact with the company. If you're debating about purchasing these, just get them. They're beautiful, easy to use, durable (actually dropped a small one the other night and nothing happened. It just bounced on the kitchen mat), seem to have great customer service... They're perfect. Go ahead and put them in your cart. I can't recommend them enough."
"Updated review: BAYCO sent replacement containers after our initial purchase/review, and so far they are holding up ok and working mostly as advertised. Was happy with the customer service, and they did take care of us after the initial bad experience.  The lids do not fit super tight so there is occasionally a little leakage, but for the most part we are using them without issue. Still keeping this at 3 stars as the lids are not dishwasher or microwave safe (At least if you want them to last). So - pretty good value, but not the best product ever.  Original review: Received these 2 days ago and unboxed them and put them on the counter to clean before use with lids attached.  My wife took them apart today to clean before storing them and the silicone seals tore on two of them. 2 days. Brand new. Then we read all the fine print: don‚Äôt store with lids on! WTF. THAT‚ÄôS THE WHOLE POINT OF SEALABLE CONTAINERS! Ok maybe not in use you leave the lids off but what is gonna happen after 2 days in the fridge?  Also, it warns you not to put lids in dishwasher despite being ‚Äúdishwasher safe‚Äù.  Will see how their warranty goes but likely returning."
I use these containers to store left over food in the refrigerator. I got rid of all my plastic containers and now use glass only. I love the lock lids because nothing will leak out of them. I only wish the lids came in a different color because I already had another set and the lids are basically the same color so it is hard to tell which lid goes with what. The shape of the bowls is a little different so the new lids won't fit on the old bowls. If you look close the new ones are a little brighter in color. That is the only way to tell the difference. Otherwise I am very happy with them.
"The packaging made sure the glass didn‚Äôt break. They are air tight as far as I can tell, keeps things fresher than plastic and I don‚Äôt have to worry about heating things up and getting chemicals from the plastic. I just throw it in the microwave directly from the fridge and it‚Äôs ready. Super easy clean up. Storage was a little tricky at first but if you follow the directions, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the glass getting stuck or breaking."
"I got these to replace my old glass containers. First of all, when I received it, I got impressed of how it is organized in the box. Each layer of foam has 2-3 containers. There are 4 layers of foam. I like it because I don't need to use all 12 of them right away, I only take out the size that I want and keep the rest organized and safe in the box. The glass is durable and truly leak proof. I am packing lunch everyday, so I need something like this: leak-proof, microwave safe and dishwasher safe. The container is easy to close, however the size is a little bit odd: the mouth of the container is wider than the bottom."
"These containers are great! The variety of shapes and sizes makes it easy to pack any leftovers or meal. I‚Äôve had Rubbermaid Tupperware that‚Äôs lasted 7 years, recently moved and our water is much harder than our other places so the plastic has to be washed out after coming out of the dish washer. That was my main reason for wanting glass. These were packed very nicely with styrofoam keeping the glass from touching. Overall, I am satisfied."
I had WLS in September which hugely impacted the amount of food I could eat so the smallest containers were perfect for that. As my eating has gotten larger in quantity I‚Äôve found the medium sized containers to hold 4 oz of meat perfectly. I liked these so much I recently bought a second set. These containers will be a perfect addition for your food needs.
"Edit: after my complaint I got a wonderful email from the company with an offer for a full refund. And I get to keep the glassware, which I still use everyday. I‚Äôve gotten a hang of how to close now so I can‚Äôt be mad at that.  I‚Äôve had these a few months and no matter what the tops just don‚Äôt fit right. They‚Äôre difficult to put on every time. I have to put down two opposite sides down at the exact same time at an exact angle or just keep opening till I can close right. I‚Äôve definitely spilled a lot with these."
"I have tried many, many meal prep/food storage containers, and I have been disappointed in some way by all of them - until now! Everything about these containers is great; I can't find a single complaint! The glass is very sturdy, as are the lids. They seal very securely and keep food fresh. This set has such a great variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate all kinds of prep and storage needs. And, they are also easy to clean. If you are looking for the perfect food storage containers with a great variety, look no further!"
"I was looking to get rid of all plastic storage containers and go to glass, but I‚Äôve got limited space. I ordered these because the smaller ones fit inside the larger ones. They are a tight fit so I have to be careful when taking them out of the drawer but they work well for my space. They were a really great price for all that I received and I love that you can remove the plastic seal from the lid for cleaning. I also love that they can go from freezer/fridge to microwave (except lids) to dishwasher."
"We use them all the time. They dont leak, and the sizes are perfect for what we need. One thing that stand out with Bayco, is they take care of you as a customer. I have worked with other companies, and Bayco truly cares about their customers and will make sure the customer is first. Had some issues I brought up with the company and after a few emails back and forth, they came through and made me feel lime I was there top priority. Thank you Bayco for taking g care of my need, and you stand out from other companies no doubt!"
"Update: I changed this to 5 stars instead of 1 because customer service was excellent. They reached out to me and offered me either a full refund or a replacement. I received the replacement set today and it's in perfect shape. I will use it and update in a few weeks.  I ordered this 2 weeks ago, everything looked great. I've only used them once or twice and one of the containers is already cracked. I hand wash and dry them, I haven't even put them in the microwave or the oven yet. Used them to store food in the fridge only. Don't waste your money."
"we don't own a microwave so I especially love how I'm able to pop off the lid and place the glass with leftovers in the oven to heat up, cuts back on the dishes by half! It's super easy to clean, the glass is thick and durable. I love how they look in my cabinet (neatly stacked) opposed to the plastic ones I had beforehand. Only downfall is that I wish I have an even bigger container so I wouldn't have to split leftovers sometimes, but that's about it."
"The rubber gasket piece comes off and you can wash the whole thing with minimal effort. I've had no problems with dishwasher cleaning either. The lower part works in ovens no issue too. I'm satisfied with it and it blows plastic containers out of the water.  Note that this is NOT leak-proof. It won't start dripping into your lunch box on the way to work, but any long-term attempt to hold liquid in it will result in it creeping out of the sides. I make my own wing sauce and tried keeping it in one of these and any amount of liquid up against the gasket will eventually creep through."
"I can no longer tolerate washing dirty, greasy plastic food containers so I started looking for affordable glass containers to replace them. I watched for them to go down in price and bought a set and realized I needed way more glass containers in order to ditch all of the plastic. The price fluctuates up and down quite often so I purchased 2 more sets when the price dropped to down to 30.00 again which is an excellent price for a set with so many. They work great and I no longer have to work so hard to get the great out the the dumb plastic containers."
"I bought my first set in July of 2020 and these bad boys are still like new. I‚Äôm buying my brother a set for his bday because I love mine so much. After all this time there are no cracks, no leaks, no issues. I put mine in the dishwasher. Would recommend."
"These are very good containers. The lids were a bit messed up, but after contacting them they told me to blanch them in hot water and that fixed them right up. The glass is thick and nice. Best part is the shapes, I have some other glass containers, but don't own different sizes, that's nice about this set. Was going to give them 4 stars, but their quick support pushed me to 5 stars. We'll see when the time how they hold up though."
"It says that it‚Äôs a set of 12, I only received 11. Wasn‚Äôt going through any hassle though for one bowl. Overall it‚Äôs a great set! I haven‚Äôt have any problems with it at all! I was a little worried due to some other reviews on the rubber binding that goes around the top of the lid, but my set is fine. It‚Äôs completely intact and rubbery like it supposed to be! The packaging was so cute and they placed the bowls inside of each other for shipping I could see how they packed 11, instead of 12."
"I got a different set of the same bayco storage containers to use last year (in white) and have loved them ever since. One time, one of them even dropped from the top of my cabinet. I thought it would shatter into a million pieces for sure but the entire thing stayed intact. The seals on them are great. Sometimes you should take the plastic seal off to wash it separately from the lid but it is easy to do. They are such great quality, I highly recommend them."
I bought these to I can prep means and heat them up in the oven without using more pans like with plastic. They're a nice variety of sizes so I can portion parts of means in multiple. I don't like divided dishes because different foods need different heating times. These are working well. The lids are plastic but very secure.
"I've been weaning myself from using plastic storage containers and these are perfect. I viewed many different sets on Amazon but really liked this set. They came well packaged and I love the variety of shapes and sizes. They don't take up much storage room as the same shape stacks easily. If I ever need more, I'll order from this seller again. The dishes have a nice weight to them and I love that I can freeze food in them, store food, and warm food up in them. Very versatile set of containers!"
"I was very impressed with the quality of these container and lids. Lids fit snugly, easy to close. There are twelve containers in the package in various sizes. I felt at first that one or two bigger ones included would have been better, but it turns out that the sizes provided are very useful. One or two portions is what they hold on average. The fact you can go straight from the freezer to the oven is great. We pre-made some lasagna twice already for my mother in law, froze it and she cooked it for herself when she needed a prepared meal. Great value for the money. Definitely would buy these again, and have given away my plastic containers in these sizes to a thrift shop."
"I've wanted to switch to glass food storage containers for quite some time. I bought this set because leak proof, silicone ring, and good reviews. They arrived well packaged! I have had them now for 3 months and they are amazing. I've had friends ask about them and one even bought a set. I love that they do not stain! I can take the containers from the fridge, to the microwave, to the dishwasher. I remove the silicone ring and wash it and the kids on the top rack of dishwasher with no problems."
Purchased these to replace various plastic containers and I am very pleased with this set. They make it easy to see the leftovers and provide a clean look. I also feel better about my food being stored in glass vs plastic. The seals come out easily for cleaning and are easy to put back in place.  I plan on finding a couple more in larger sizes. But this set is perfect for leftovers and taking single serve portions.
"After years of having mismatched pieces of storage containers, struggling finding the right covers, unstackable pieces, I'm so happy to have purchased these dishes. They stack beautifully and save so much space in my cabinets. I like them so much that I've been contemplating mailing a set to my daughter for a gift. The only slight drawback is the lids. They have a rubber seal so it's not recommended to put in dishwasher. The rubber seal is removable but I choose to handwash to maintain the quality of the storage containers. I'm so glad I broke down and bought these containers"
"They were smaller than I expected but I am taking them ad a blessing. Portion control is often an issue. These glass containers are great for food prep. Now instead of one huge container of leftovers, I can divvy up for individual meals. Glass means no worries about toxins leeching into my food, or staining. The only downside is not the company's fault since glass is well, breakable. No leaking and the lids snap on nice and easy. Love these! You won't be disappointed"
Was worried about the shipping as they are glass. It‚Äôs amazing how well these 12 sets of different size containers were packaged. They were sitting in four styrofoam racks and non of them were damaged when they arrived. Quality of glass is good with no sharp edges. Their covers fit well and they are easy to clip on. Microwaved my spaghetti using the middle size container and container is intact. Have not tried putting them in freezer yet. Just hope they would have bigger size containers included in this set.
"I recently started meal prepping me and my husbands meals to save money and make better snacking choices. These are great containers and very versatile. I've made soups and stored them in these containers with no leaking on my trek to work. I freeze some of my lunches in the containers and they freeze and thaw very well. they microwave very cold food quickly and evenly. Some divided containers I've had in the past take a VERY long time to heat up the food. They are easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. Because of these dishes I've been able to stick to my meal prep and loose 10lbs, save $80 a week in food expenses, and save lots of time."
"If you are like me, you enjoy meal prepping, and even saving the left over‚Äôs. These glass dishes are perfect. The easy snap on lids creates the extra security for me when traveling with these and the glass gives me that extra durability. They come in a variety of sizes, they are easy to clean and they don't stain. They are perfect for me to put smaller portions in, and take to work for lunches throughout the week. They fit in my work lunch box, and are easy to microwave. You seriously can‚Äôt go wrong with these."
Sizes and shapes are varied and easily stackable for compact storage. # of pieces and price is an exceptional value compared to others I have seen. Prompt shipment and delivery. Couldn't ask for better.
The quality of these storage containers is great. The glass is thick and the top snapps on which means you can safely store anything in it and it won't spill. It's exactly what I was looking for. I only wish the set had more bigger sizes in it. But definitely worth the purchase.
"I've been looking for a nice set of glass containers for a while now and I'm glad I settled on these. They are leak proof, no accidents when my lunch box gets tumbled in the fridge at work. And they are really easy to get clean. I bought a few of a different brand a few months ago and the husband did not approve because the rubber gasket was too hard to remove from the lids. With these, I'm happy to say that my fully grown, adult husband no longer needs me to disassemble my container lids prior to washing üòâ"
"I don't typically write reviews of products, but I am happy to do so for the Bayco food storage containers. I read all the reviews about them and read reviews for similar products by other companies before considering buying any containers. The reviews were similar across the various products & companies (some good, some bad). What made me select the Bayco containers were the reviews indicating they had good customer service. Am glad I chose them. All containers arrived is perfect condition. They were obviously packaged well. Plus there was a12-month warranty card in the box. Awesome! I have been using the containers for a few weeks now. No problems with lids not fitting or being hard to close. No problem with the glass breaking or chipping. I like the various sizes and shapes. I would like some bigger containers for larger quantities of leftovers, and will be on the lookout for any."
"I love these bowls. I decided to switch everything from plastic and I have been satisfied with these so far. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs been about four months. Also, it recommends to hand wash the lids for maximum durability. I remove the rubber lining and wash that separately as well."
"Love these storage containers!! They look great & are leakproof. The silicone bands that make the container airtight & the lids should be hand washed. Glass part cleans up well in the dishwasher. If you store them for awhile, product recommends that you place plastic wrap between lid & glass to prevent bands from sticking. I initially did this, but became too much trouble It's just a little harder to open them. Storing them separately should resolve this issue."
"Update: Bayco proactively reached out and refunded me in full. Very good customer service.  Previous review: The alignment of the lids are off and they are very difficult to close. Three out of the four snaps are usually fine, but the last one takes a lot of force to close. I reached out to the company and they told me to just make sure that the lids are aligned. They are not. This is a design flaw. I wish so much that I bought a different set instead."
"I bought a set 8 months ago and this is my 2nd set. From microwave to freezer, excellent set. Watch when you microwave, the tops are sealed proof, which are great for the oven and freezer, but I had difficult a couple of times. I now put at room temperature or use with parchment. Much easier."
"I'm in love with these food storage containers. Without fail, I always seem to have leftovers after I've served a meal and these containers are perfect sizes for those leftovers. They are sturdy, the lids fit perfectly and they are easy to clean. They are sturdy and well made. I love using glass containers because they clean perfectly as opposed to so many plastic ones that show wear over time."
"These containers are the perfect size to package leftovers for lunch. They are easy to clean, you just have to remember to take out the rubber seal when you wash them (which I find more hygienic anyway). The nest pretty easily and look very nice when stacked in the cupboard. I like that there is a lip all the way around the container edge, so you don't have to worry too much about trying to line up the clasps with a specific part of the container."
"I purchase these food storage containers as a viable alternative to plastic. Just received, these glass containers and with plastic lids are good quality. The lids have a silicone seal and are easy to use even with one hand. The sizes contained will meet most needs and are microwave and dishwasher safe. Best of all no food stains or retained food smells."
"Recently my friend convinced me to replace all my plastic containers. I didn‚Äôt want to spend so much money on replacing what I was using down leftover food, but knew it was something I needed to do. This 12 piece glass storage set is reasonable priced and the sizes are perfect for leftovers. None of these are super large which is good for storage and I like that it comes with smaller ones for small leftovers or like sauces. None of the containers came damaged and all the lids fit."
"I try to use glass instead of plastic for storage so picked these. The lids are great. They seal well for transporting lunch to work leak-free. The lids are also way easy to put on. The size variation is nice. And a random one from someone who moves a lot, the box the same in as a wonderful design! I will be keeping the box for beautiful transport of these containers whenever I move."
"I haven't used it yet, but I always forget a review. The pieces are all undamaged and accounted for. The glass feels lighter than the Pyrex ones I'm familiar with. It gives a satisfying pop when I snap it down. I will update if they turn out not to be leak proof."
"We were tired of plastic containers - chasing lids, leaking, contamination, etc. These Bayco containers solved our problem. They see durable enough; keeping in mind they are glass. You have to treat them like glass. I use them daily to take lunch in (leftovers). Convenient sizes. Will be ordering again."
"The only reason I give them a 4/5 stars on easy to clean is because you need to wash the lids by hand. But to have them last longer, I'm willing to do that. Sometimes the seal is so good I have to almost pey the lids off. I haven to found the ideal storage for these dishes yet, but just like the handout sent with them said, I do plan to store the containers and lids separately. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. Love the colors, love the dishes, and feel I got a good deal for the money."
"I use these to prep my dogs homemade food and freeze. So far they have been great, none have broken, have been frozen and used 4 or 5 times now. Lids are a bit difficult to get off so may be hard for some people but I haven‚Äôt broken one yet. Thought I would when it was frozen but so far so good! Very happy with my purchase. I bought 2packs thinking some would break, so I expect to not have to buy anymore for a long long time."
"I purchased these to use in my freezer. I ended up using them for all kinds of things. 50 sounds like alot but they were so usefull I had to buy more. The tops stay on in the freezer, but can be removed fairly easily. In the sewing and desk area you can see what's in them."
"These containers do not stain, not even with red sauce. The only downside to them is if you drop them while frozen they tend to splinter."
"I have fought the food storage problems for years. lost lids, hand outs that don't come back, proper size etc I bought three sizes of these containers with matching lids. the price was so good that I bought large quantities, 50 in each size, 150 total. they work great, and since they are so affordable I can have a continuous supply on hand at all times. so when these containers disappear, like socks in the dryer do, into thin air, I have interchangeable parts at hand. reat product. Jim C."
"These containers can be used for ANYTHING you can think of. Reusable over and over. Do be careful taking lid off as it is very tight fitting...cracked a few lids...BUT overall they're a 10! Used for holiday gifting cookies, candy and leftovers! Holds technically 3 cups (such as soup) plus space allowed for freezing."
"I bought the round containers for years, I swore by them for food prep. Then I found the multi-compartment containers and they were amazing for 75% of my needs. But when it came to salads, fruits, and veggies I wanted something else. A quick search on Amazon brought these up, the price was right so I gave them a chance. The first time I stacked these in the fridge I was a believer! These stack perfect, they fit in the fridge in an orderly manner, they are just right for salad. I will buy more."
These are perfect for packing in lunches or for individual meals. I make meals for an elderly couple so they only need to reheat. These are perfect sized and so easy to stack & pack. Easy to freeze. I just throw them in the top rack of my dishwasher and they are ready for the next meal. They also are the perfect size to pack cookies in for the grandchildren to take home. Love them!
"Can't have enough containers for leftovers and gatherings! Recently purchased the 50 pack of food storage containers to hold food in smaller portions for a party that we were having. They washed nicely in the dishwasher, they stack nicely in the fridge and freezer and overall I'm very happy with this purchase! You get a lot of containers for a very fair prices and now I don't have to worry about running out of storage options for leftovers."
"These are smaller than they look, about 1/5 the size of a standard shoe box but seal tightly and plastic is not brittle straight from the freezer. I pulled one out of the freezer and ripped it open to test. No cracks and sealed back up fine. great for food or just storing stuff."
"Love these little boxes, got them yesterday and sent my hubby off to work with them today. I love the way thethe lids and containers stack well in the cabinet and in the fridge. I probably would not put these in the microwave or dish washer; but they work great for veggies fruit and meats. They didn't leak when I put water in them but they are not super sturdy so I wouldn't say pack soup in one that's gonna be bumped around in a lunch box all day. I really bought them though to do meal prep for mine and my husband's lunches and I think these will be perfect for that. I will test one in the microwave soon and update."
"These are awesome! I just started a meal prep plan that requires me to eat weighed portions of food 4 times a day. The portions are small so I found the traditional meal prep containers to be too big, and would take up too much space. These are durable, seal up great, stack really nice in the fridge and lunch pail, and microwave perfect. We even washed them in the dishwasher with no warping at all! Just bought my second set, can‚Äôt say enough good things about these."
Five stars. Perfect size and shape. I am always looking for things that can make life easy and more efficient these do so with a couple of small cautions. The plastic can turn brittle in the freezer so you need to let them rest a few seconds once you take them out of the freezer and use care opening. That said I use these daily and am extremely happy. They make organizing things in the fridge and freezer a breeze and I use them for non-food items as well. They stack and can be used in rows so that you aren't cramming around with assorted bags and boxes. They are see through so you don't have to label everything. I look in my fridge/Freezer and know exactly what I have and same with cupboards.
"Description says ""Disposable Containers"" and the cost is 40 cents each. I see them as permanent (for me), but wouldn't lose sleep if I left it at someone's house or disposed while on a trip. Worked very well in microwave and dishwasher, so I'll trust them on freezer too. Recycle triangle says PP = Polypropylene, one of the safer kinds of plastics. Lids ARE a good, snug fit. I left it loose for the microwave. Plus: each lid has a rectangular area to put on a 3.75"" x 1.75"" label (I love it) or write on with a permanent marker. Dimensions: With lid, each is 4 5/8"" x 6 3/4"" x 2 1/4"". They looked a little small, but each holds 3 cups of water (gravy, soup, stew, jello, etc.) with a little extra room (1 more oz). So the description is accurate. A 6"" sub or turkey wrap fits nicely. My wraps are 7+"" in diameter and I just tuck the ends in and the container holds the sandwich in = no need to use a toothpick. For reference, a 12 oz soda can fits in with room to spare, but the diameter just fits. My point is the size is right for one or two servings of food. a sandwich, or a salad. For a ton of leftovers or party food, use multiple containers. They stack and fit in fridge better than the round containers. Empty containers stack together to minimize space. Lastly, I like the transparency for food and non-food items. I'm starting to use a few for pens and pencils, paper clips, etc. Will definitely reorder, after I work my way through 50! *** Follow-up 30 days later: still love them. Maybe not ""permanent"", one has a small crack on the lip (for sealing, not inside where the food is) AFTER (ab)using it for at least 10 times. I might have stepped on it. A little light weight in the dishwasher, so one flips over and comes out filled with water -- the other 4 or so stay face down. Lids dishwash easily and clean. They microwave really well, with cover on, but partly open or loose. FYI: Not just reheat. I cooked scrambled eggs in one and it worked really well. Spayed inside with no-stick spray, cooked 1 minute, stirred, until done. Serve and store. Maybe beyond what they were designed for, but worked for me. Less to wash."
"My family goes through more than our share of containers. We bought these to curb the frustration of losing expensive, crusty, discolored and eternally greasy containers (some big brands didn‚Äôt last). These containers are much more durable than expected and of a perfect size for leftovers and lunches. They are softer and more flexible after being heated but they do not bubble up or meld with their contents. A few have settled into a bendy shape after heated so it doesn‚Äôt sit flat and the lid doesn‚Äôt fit as well, they may be able to be fixed but I haven‚Äôt tried. They wash best in very warm water and haven‚Äôt discolored or stayed greasy feeling. We have not needed to dispose of them except the few mentioned above that didn‚Äôt fit their lids anymore (which does mean SO many of them are still unused). They more than met my expectations."
I use these for my dogs raw meals. I prep many meals at a time so the value of these are awesome! Sometimes my dogs chew the edges but unless it‚Äôs completed demolished the lid will still go on. I do wish it wasn‚Äôt so easy for them to chew this...but if a furry 4 legged friend isn‚Äôt eating out of it you should be good. Dishwasher safe!!
"For the price, I was amazed at how many containers you get, 50! They are not the highest end food containers that will last forever but they are decent for the price. I filled it up with water and flipped it upside down and a few drops came out when I shook it but it actually held a tight seal otherwise. Great for storing fruits, vegetables, rice etc!"
"These have made my foray into dieting a BREEZE. I got these and a little scale and I measure out equal portions of meats, snacks, fruits, etc so I can just grab them and use them. Meal Prep - who knew?  I don't do anything really fancy in terms of meal planning, so these are perfect for me. I can stick them in the dishwasher easily, just about any given food fits inside just fine, and they're flexible enough to ""pour"" stuff out (like rice, I squeeze the sides of the container and it acts like a big funnel, easy peasy). BUT!  We've been using these to freeze meats. After cutting up chicken or pork, we like to portion it into these containers with a measured amount of oil (garlic chili or rosemary), chicken broth, and spices to create a little marinade, then we like to freeze it. Our freezer is full of these containers with marinated meat inside, we just take out a container and by the time it thaws, it's marinated the meat inside perfectly. But jeez, if you DROP one of those containers fresh out the freezer, it will SHATTER.  That's to be expected I guess, it IS thin flimsy plastic, and you get FIFTY of these containers, so it's hard to feel broken up about it. But it scared the crap out of me when we pulled out a container, oopsie, BOOM and shrapnel went everywhere. It was like that scene in Saving Private Ryan when the mortar goes off, I was stumbling around my kitchen confused just dragging half of my girlfriend behind me.  Oh, also, these take up VERY little space when you're storing them in the cabinet, fifty of these take up the same amount of space as twelve tupperwares."
"Our 2 Dogs are on a raw food diet an we were storing a month plus of meals for them in ziplock baggies, until I found these. I did do quite a bit of research and these are the perfect size for our 2 Vizslas, as well as our son't 2 Vizslas. It is so much faster to fill these then the baggies, easier to store them in these, not as much wasted space as with some other containers. So far we have gone through all of what we have at least 3 times freezing, thawing, and washing them in the dishwasher with no loss to date, unless one of them was borrowed by one of our son's so he could help clean it out. So far I am very happy with these and have just now purchased the 5th set, so we have enough to make another batch for the boys this weekend and so we have some for other uses. These also store away nice and tight when not in use. Which is a great benefit over so many other containers, as storage can be an issue."
"Deli containers are very handy to have available when preparing foods and storing them. I do production cooking where I will fix 50 meals for the freezer in one day. Finding suitable containers has been quite a challenge.  I only eat about 20 ounces of food at any given meal. Most of the time I don't eat that much so I really wish they would make smaller versions of this container.  Round containers waste a lot of space in the freezer. While I want plenty of air around the containers, while they cool, once out of the refrigerator and in the freezer, I want the food as compactly stored as possible and round containers can't do that.  I've tried a variety of rectangular, take-out containers but most leave a lot of room at the top which leads to freezer burn if the food is stored for very long. It also wastes freezer space. I haven't had a problem with that with these containers.  Another problem with the round deli containers is that they are often tamper proof though they don't always advertise that. Taking the lids off can be a challenge for people with hand problems and lids or bases often get broken in the process. I have one set that I regularly have to break to open.  I bought my set of these containers in October of 2020. I haven't lost a lid or base in that time--even after multiple uses. I am careful, however, to let containers sit for at least 10 minutes, before opening them after taking them out of the freezer. Most of the time I take them out of the freezer, the night before I plan to use their contents, and pop them in the fridge. The contents don't totally defrost and are much easier to work with then when frozen solid.  I plan to buy more sets of these containers in the future. Unfortunately, I really need 8-and 16-ounce containers, which no one seems to make in a square or rectangular form, so I'm stuck with round containers for a lot of my meal prep and storage. But I'm sure someone will realize the need for other sizes, in a square or rectangular form and start making them in the near future."
"We recently started a garden and were looking to not only do our usual meal prep for the week, but also freeze garden produce for long periods of time. These containers are very impressive. They are easy to seal and the lids close all the way around without having to lean on them and wrestle them closed. Once closed, they open easily enough, but don't leak or pop open when shoved around in a crowded fridge. We have frozen items for several weeks and reheated them in the microwave, tossed the containers in the dishwasher, and reused. No stains, no loss in quality. The price also can't be beat - we have made meals for family members and given them the meals in these containers without worrying about the cost. When I need more containers, these will be the ones I will buy again."
"NOT WATERPROOF: If you put liquid in these when they are brand new, close them tightly, and ...slowly....carefully...gently...turn them sideways, the water will probably not come out. For all practical applications however, they will leak if not kept upright.  NOT HIGHLY DURABLE: They stack but don't plan on stacking very high or heavy. The plastic is soft so the stack will wobble a bit. I would freeze in these but not microwave. Transfer to a ceramic plate/bow for heating. Most likely mechanism of failure is breaking the rim of the container or tabs on the lid that latch to the lid of the container. Mine are already discoloring from stress of being opened.  EXCELLENT VALUE FOR LIGHT DUTY MEAL PREP/STORAGE You get 50 containers and lids for about 20 bucks! For storing things like that are rather light and don't spill (like rice or chopped veggies) these are awesome. I also love these for keeping pantry food tidy when the original box is too big(like oatmeal packets or granola bars)."
"This is a great value for so many containers. I do not like having a bunch of containers of varying sizes with different lids all over. I only use these now, this way the bottoms are all stacked together and the lids are the same and stacked right next to them. My cabinet stays nice and tidy. I thought I would miss having big containers but I don't. All leftovers are divided up into these containers which are the perfect size for one portion when you are ready to eat your leftovers. Because they stack so well once sealed too, my fridge stays tidy too. It's also nice that you can see what is inside of them. Grab one, loosen the lid and microwave the leftovers right in the container. If I'm by myself, I'll even eat my meal out of the container instead of dirtying up a dish. I have had these a long time now, I have thrown away a few that have gotten stained up from red sauces...that's another nice thing about these, if one starts looking raggedy you toss it because you have soooo many more. I really, REALLY, like these and don't see myself ever going back to any other food storage container...tidy cupboard, tidy fridge, portion control, freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe....a winner for me all the way around!"
"I washed these in the sink before use. Would I put in the dishwasher? No. They don't seem thick enough to withstand and washing them by hand takes no time. I didn't expect them to be a thick plastic. I notice the lids are hard to get off (which I guess is a good thing). I did the 'upside down leak test' and while they are tight fitting, if there is liquid and you turn it upside down the little edge do fill up with liquid and drip, but that was me TRYING to get it to leak. I am using these for food storage in the fridge and freezer and they are great for that pupose and don't plan on turning them upside down or use for packing of lunches. They are great for solid stuff to be sure. Feeling like I will find many uses for them, even in the garage for nails, etc."
"I use these to portion and freeze after bulk cooking. The plastic does not become brittle in the freezer, and I have not noticed any warping or blistering in the microwave. So far, I have stored both tomato sauce and curry based meals with no noticeable staining. Grease residue is easier to remove than most plastic storage bowls. No noticeable odors after heated or after being washed. I have only hand washed them. So far, we have not had any leaks, but we do not use these for soups and such. They are slightly opaque, sharpie pens write on the top and wash off easily."
"I love these containers! At first I was slightly disappointed, because they were flimsy. But as I started using them, I found out, if I don't feel like washing them because they are stained or they have some funky stuff growing inside the container because I didn't see it at the back of my refrigerator, I just toss them. Great for school lunches as well. I have the attitude, if these containers dont make it back from school, oh well. For the price, I wasn't going to worry abotut it. Good investment if you want a container that you dont need to worry about losing. Will purchase again!"
"They are NOT like other containers. They don't absorb odors and they don't stain. I use them every day. They keep my fridge organized and even when stacked, I can see what's in them. They are tough. I have washed them over and over again in the top rack of the dishwasher. I bought 50 of them 2 years ago. I love them so much, I bought 50 more today. I don't need 50 more right now, but I didn't want to take the chance they wouldn't be available when I needed more. I put them through hard, regular use and they withstand everything I throw at them."
"I bought these containers as an inexpensive way to give away baked goods in reusable containers. They're perfect for this; my family members prefer not to have huge amounts of cookies/muffins, but each container holds enough average -sized cookies and muffins for one person to have in a sitting or two (or to share with a friend). They nest/stack nicely, so it's not inconvenient to store the ones we haven't used yet. They've also been incredibly useful in storing and organizing our kids' smaller toys and D&D figures. The containers are cheap enough that it's not a big deal for them to get lost or broken, but they're just sturdy enough to withstand multiple uses/washes. I accidentally crushed one under a recliner. The thing looks worse for wear, but it's still intact and the plastic toys inside didn't get smashed. I would definitely recommend these if you're looking for a happy medium between an expensive/super-durable storage system and, say, cheap/single-use styrofoam, paper or thin plastic."
"These are not meant to last a loong time, especially if using in the microwave with certain types foods. But, I've appreciated the versatility and functionality as well as how many you get for very little $ I use them for dry storage, freezer foods, leftovers and my lunch. The lunch storage being the best use for me since they are light weight and stack well and hold the perfect portion sizes for me. I've tossed a couple because of staining and melting--but I should have known better than to microwave tomato and greasy foods in them! Will purchase again."
"These containers are so helpful because of their uniform size. You can stack them up in the refrigerator or freezer. I don‚Äôt think they would be great for long term freezing, but they take up less space because they are stacking rectangles. I‚Äôm dumping all my round storage containers. Don‚Äôt remove the lid when the container is fresh out of the freezer, it might snap off."
"I like that these are all the same size, so never any searching for the right lids. They seem to fit in a lot of small spaces in the 'fridge and freezer which I appreciate. I did have one instance where one seemed to leak, but I'm wondering if I just didn't have it on tight. They work well for left overs and are stackable. I'm guessing that they would work well for ahead of time meal preps. I really haven't used them in the microwave, so can't speak to that, but they seem to freeze well without cracking. They are thin, but seems durable all the same. Overall, very pleased!"
"I love these: first of all you have 50 with lids. So if you forget to clean out the fridge until it is science experiment time, no big loss.  But having 50 containers of the same size lets you be really organized, which is something I need. You can see through the tops and sides to see what is in there.  Best part, they clean perfectly in the top rack of your dishwasher! They do not get etched in white or destroyed like the grocery store containers.  I am single and tend to cook recipes for 4. Leftovers for 3 will fit in them. If you need something larger, see if this company has a larger size. These are much sturdier than grocery store products so you will do well by ordering this size and maybe a larger size if they have one. I am going to look into that myself."
"I'm down to about 4 containers that are not being used for storage of foods, pens, parts, tools etc....Or been lost or given away, and for me, 4 just ain't enough of these to have free at any one time, therefore I just ordered 50 more. I live in a RV with a standard Refrig/Freezer plus a 4 cubic foot freezer. I can stack around 25 of these in the freezer with labels and still have room for my other freezer goods. Easy to sort n see what's what. I highly recommend for any sized household."
"Ok ok ok ... I do clean my fridge. But the biggest challenge for me and my family is to both be eco-friendly and keep my fridge clean. I don't know about you, but my family and I always have this challenge to keep our fridge free of raw poultry smell or avoid accidental fluid leakage from the raw poultry.  In order to ensure the fridge to remain clean, hygiene and odorless, we opt to use a resealable plastic bag. But those are one-time use and not that eco-friendly. These are true, until I have the opportunity to try these food storage containers with lid.  Usage: - I use it to store any extra poultry that I do not use or to be used for the next meal. - I use it to store dry or smoked or season food that needs to be stored in the fridge.  Pro: - Great container to store raw poultry: no spillage, no smell, and can easily stack on top of each other. - I use 3M note stickies to label these containers of its content. The container surface can easily be attached to this temporary label with no issue. -Compact and semi stackable. - No residual after use. I have used the containers for over 2 weeks, washed and reuse. These containers remained in great condition and no smell at all. The most important is there's no greasy or oily residual retained in the container after a simple wash with dish soap and warm water. - Semi-translucent color allows me to easily identify content without removing the lid. - I can reuse it over and over again.  Con: - Nothing yet!!!! Well maybe offer color lid option to distinguish food groups?  I might consider buying more to get the fridge even more organized and fewer dependencies on the one-time-use plastic bags."
"I love these! I use them literally every day for left overs, to go packs, cut up and store fruits or lunch ready to pick on or go. They are microwave, dishwasher and freezer safe. Super convenient organizing in your fridge. I‚Äôve ordered 3 times this pack. Used them all end of last year for holidays and take home left overs. The kids always take them for lunch or snacks to school or park. They are durable enough, but economic enough to not mind if people never bring it back and trust me - that was always a thing. People never remember to bring back. I‚Äôm putting my fourth order in, so it was fair to share the love. Hope this helps!"
My husband is awful about bringing our Tupperware home. So by the time they get to me they‚Äôre usually a bit moldy and quite gross. The Rubbermaid ones we would have to just throw away because they became brittle and just wouldn‚Äôt get clean! These are perfect. They clean up amazingly. I‚Äôve noticed only some slight staining but I can‚Äôt remember what was in it but it‚Äôs not the point I think ew and throw it away like other brands. Just very light after multiple uses. Like I said a lot don‚Äôt make it home so I liked how many it came with at the price so buying new ones is also great. The best part was once they‚Äôre heated up or after washing in a dishwasher they aren‚Äôt brittle! Other food prep containers have done that to us. They do become a little flimsy and bend if they‚Äôre really hot so it just makes it hard to get out of the microwave sometimes but they mold back. That‚Äôs probably my only complaint is they become a bit too soft when heated up but the fact they go back it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be ordering more soon as my husband continues to lose them or we use them to give stuff to others.
"Ok, whoever measured this made a mistake. It is 24 oz though, that was correct. But it is not 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.5. the actual measurement of the base is 5.25 X 4 X 2.25.  Product use tip #1: Don't rip off the top lid by opening from one side. My wife does this and it cracks the lids. Unlock the lid first all the way around 1 time by sliding your fingers. The locking mechanism is really very good and secure.  The plastic is fairly thin, but more rigid than disposable glad 99 cent store sandwich containers. It's like the same kind of plastic they use on top of pringles cans. So even though the measurements were wrong and I was expecting a slightly bigger box, I kept it anyways because it's still useable.  EDIT: I've been using these for almost 8 months now, and it's really useful. I use it daily with my lunch boxes or storage in the fridge. I even put some tools in them in the garage. if they were cheaper I'd give it a 5."
These are smaller than I thought but well made. They can hold up to a pound and a half of ground meat. They are stackable. I have only just started using them. I will update later with more if needed. A tip for opening them so you don't break the lid: open on the corner and then slide your finger alone the short edge to loosen the seal. Otherwise you will crack the lid. I only broke one fresh out of the freezer. Once I changed the way I opened them I haven't had a problem.
i love these little containers. they fit a surprising amount of food. 1/2 of a sliced up pineapple. 3 people's portion of beef stew. I use them for food and for crafts.  I appreciate how there's very little grooves. previously for meal prepping and freezing i tried a bento style plastic container. those cracked and/or had so many grooves on the bottom side. these are super easy. they don't crack in the freezer. they are very stackable. they are small enough and of a low enough profile that you can store many things instead of trying to fit just a few bulky meal prep containers.
"Purchased these to specifically fit in a new lunch bag I bought for work. Have ended up using them for storing all kinds of things in the refrigerator and freezer. Have washed/reused them many times and they hold up really well. It says they are microwave safe, but I haven't used them in the microwave for fear of the bubbling that happens with plastic in the microwave. I guess I should just try one to see what happens. These could store a whole lot more than food items. Craft or sewing items, crayons, nuts/bolts/screws, etc."
"Absolutely love these for meal prepping and to use for leftovers for my toddler. I love that they are all the same size, which makes them very easy to use and stack. These have saved us so much room in our fridge because we can get 5 to stack on top of each other with room to spare. Before we got these we had Rubbermaid assorted sizes and sometimes would only be using a fraction of the container, but it would take up so much more room in the fridge.  So far (a couple months of use) these have held up well and have been microwaved and put in the dishwasher repeatedly. I have not frozen them, so I cannot speak to that."
"I have had these containers for almost two years. I bought the 50 pack and I would say about 10 of them have worn out in some capacity (lid or base cracking). That is 40 fewer than I thought would crack or break!  These are great. The shape is such that they stack nicely, and I can fit more in the freezer than if I had round containers!  My 85 year old father recently moved close to me when my mother passed away. These have been great to use as freezer meals for him. I often just make double batches of food and freeze several portions for him. He thaws them in the fridge overnight and then sticks them straight into the microwave and eats directly out of them to save dishwashing and they have held up!  I have been able to use these again and again as they are quite durable under regular use.  The only real complaint I have is that they are not airtight, so I do need to be mindful if I am using them to take my lunch to work. I can't just throw them in a bag with anything else. I have to make sure they are sitting flat or that I have them inside of a plastic bag in case of leaks. But for freezer meal prep use for my dad they are perfect!  I will be replacing them with more of the same when I need to."
These containers seem pretty flimsy but if ur putting hot food in the make sure u put it on the counter and store them flat. If hot the seal will be good. I have microwaved them and they go back to flimsy. Be very careful. The super good thing about them besides they r cheap is that if u stain it or if it ends up in the back of the fridge starting a science experiment u wont feel.guilty throwing them away
"I don't know what the negative fuss is all about from other consumers, but this product has made my life so much easier. I could probably fit about 45 containers in my apartment-size freezer compartment. But as you see, I have 32 containers, all labeled, and easy to view and use. Each container easily holds one package of frozen veggies. For fresh produce, I just cut, clean, and add to the containers. The size might appear small on first view after purchasing, but they are the perfect size for my needs. Also, I have NOT seen another company selling same-size containers for such a reasonable cost."
"I swore off 'gladware' years ago. The kitchen cupboard full of slightly different sized lids. The worry about chemicals leaching from the plastic. But there are only so many glass containers I can own, and the spike in bulk food ordering for 'lockdown' had me revisit the wonderful world of plastics. These are a great shape and size and have the soft flex and low/non-leaching properties of HDPE plastic. (They can still crack, for example if you try to cut them with scissors to help build a water wheel for an elementary school project.) I've not microwaved one, so I don't know how well they hold up to that, but they freeze well and I've not had one crack even if I've put it in the freezer with cooled down prepared food, wet or dry. If they seller would add a 32oz tall but square cross-section container I'd be set for containers for some time"
"When I first unpacked these I was disappointed. They seemed cheap and flimsy and like they weren‚Äôt worth the cost. BUT after using them for just a week, I‚Äôm convinced. I stored soup in them, and nothing leaked. I microwaved the soup in them (without the lid, as the manufacturer recommends), and while the container does get a bit more flexible it doesn‚Äôt melt or bubble up or anything like that. And then I froze the soup, and microwaved it from frozen, and the container still held up. The ones I put in the dishwasher didn‚Äôt warp. And they‚Äôre such perfect portion sizes for me, personally, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about separating something out from a larger container. I‚Äôve spent more money on less containers that didn‚Äôt hold up half as well. I‚Äôll definitely be adding these to my list so I can buy more after I inevitably lose most of them."
"BEST darned food storage containers I've ever had! I've had matching, latching and burping varieties that don't out-perform these. I love the size, the translucence so you can figure out what's in them at a glance when you open the fridge. They're dishwasher sturdy (top rack) and tomato sauce and red greasy messes don't stain them through-and-through like Ziplock and Gladware. The stackability when full and nesting while empty make them perfect for a well-organized kitchen and your fridge looks ""merchandised"" with everything the same size (which is more than a single portion so left-overs have a perfect destination). They also make great craft storage and paint containers for touch-up paint. love, Love, LOVE"
"These have become my go to storage container. I use them for EVERYTHING, not just food storage. Food storage is great and I have liked these better than the Rubbermaid Red lid storage containers, (plan to phase out those). These are a good size for meal prep on left overs or prepping food to be ready to eat from the fridge. I have them in use for the following; strawberries, cantalope, grapes, pineapple, cheese, left over meats. I have put soups in them along with salads. Aside from food I have found the size good for phone chargers and cable storage, screws, nuts & bolts odds and ends from around the house. Great for what ever you feel you need to put in a place not to be lost or stored away for use later. Going to purchase more."
"I‚Äôve tried LOTS of different food storage containers throughout the years so I consider myself somewhat of an expertüòâ. These are by far among the best ones out there, if not THE best. Dishwasher and microwave friendly.  What makes these containers unique are that they have a slightly ‚Äúbendy‚Äù or pliable kind of plastic without compromising stability ‚Äîsomething that makes them easy to close/open and keeps them from breaking easily. Try them, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"These are no frills but highly functional storage containers. my first thought when I saw them was that they were cheap and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they performed. They stack well in the freezer without wasting space and even more important they seal well and don't leak. I was driving food over to a friend and had to brake suddenly. 2 containers of soup fell off the seat and hit the floor. Expecting the worst I was happily surprised to find them both still fully sealed. I haven't washed any of them yet to know how easy they clean but consider them to be an excellent value since name brand "" disposable"" containers I have peviously purchased cost significantly more and usually didn't stay sealed near as well. I'm quite comfortable recommending them to people I know."
"I have grown frustrated with buying food containers to only have them stain when placing anything with a red sauce in them. If they don't get stained, they end up with a white residue from the dishwasher that you cannot get rid of. BUT I love these. No they might not look fancy but they do not stain, no residue from dishwasher tabs and I use these in the microwave. Not to mention 50 of these for such a low cost. I won't buy anything else!"
"These are not completely leak proof... You can decrease the chance of leaks by making certain the lid is on properly and then don't tip container too much. For the price, they are great. My wife purchased two sizes, and the best part is the lids fit both sizes containers. Yay! No hunting for there correct lid. She labels the lids with a Sharpie marker and freezes the meals. They writing easily comes off by soaking the lid in hot soapy water or with a magic eraser."
These containers are exactly what I needed for my freezer. The size is just right for portioning out meals for my husband and I. I use labels that wash away for the perfect combo. They stack well for a tidier and more efficient freezer space. The price is low enough that it makes it easy to give my food creations to family and friends. I am very happy with this purchase and plan on buying more in the future.
"2 years in a row I purchased a pack of these to bring to Thanksgiving dinner to pack up leftovers. They're perfect for give-away Tupperware so you don't lose your good Rubbermaid containers. They're also good for meal prep. Dishwasher safe, microwave safe. Careful after using these in the fridge or freezer. The lids get brittle in the cold and tend to break at the corners after a few uses."
"These containers are by far THE BEST ! The lid fits especially tight and yet are easily removed. Leakproof! Perfect size and stack perfectly. I cannot say enough about this storage product! The price is so economical, you can discard them at any time--although!--they do last and last. TRY THEM, you will not be disappointed !!! [I wish the company would bring back the 17 oz size as well!]"
"Great deal, these are the perfect size for portioning servings, they are the perfect size to prep for keto, salad fixings, etc. They stack well in the fridge, take up almost no space in the cabinets and are perfect for lunch bags. The price is amazing for how many you get - in fact, I often send leftovers home in them and tell people to keep the container - so much less hassle than asking for the containers back! I have used them in the freezer, microwave and dishwasher without any issues the 1 star people reported - never had any stink, either."
"I bake cookies to send in care packages to my kids who are away at college, and these containers are perfect for keeping the cookies fresh and intact. The lid snaps on securely and tightly. The rectangular shape with with relatively straight sides means that I can fit in more cookies than I would have thought possible (I had to bake some more cookies!). The white color makes these containers useful for all occasions. They are even washable and reusable. These are a great value, and I will be buying more."
"These are perfect for work snacks and lunches. The kids snap nicely. They‚Äôre cheap, so don‚Äôt expect top notch thick containers. I typically hand wash these, every once in awhile I‚Äôll throw them in the dishwasher-no heat. I haven‚Äôt microwaved these...but as with any plastic, I wouldn‚Äôt reccomend it! These stack nicely in a lunch bag and they‚Äôre lightweight. Because there‚Äôs so many to a box and cheap, I won‚Äôt lose sleep over a few that I give to others for leftovers from a dinner...or say something I stored in the fridge had gone bad-I‚Äôll just throw the whole thing away. Just recently I found a new use for them: crayons! They hold crayons wonderfully. Which gives me other ideas to use them for arts and crafts for our homeschool room. Maybe puzzle pieces too! Great buy, highly recommend!"
"I've been searching for rectangular, BPA-free, plastic containers and am happy with my purchase. For the price they can't be beat. I do wish they were a bit sturdier (a thicker plastic) as the covers can break if you're not careful. Just received them so haven't used very long so we'll see how they stand up to use. Great for stacking and organizing not only food but also crafts. For the price they are very good - came well packed and stacked together without breakage."
"I need about 60 containers, for one item for my husbands employees for their Christmas bags. Past years Ive been buying ziploc or rubbermaid, saw these and ordered them. The plastic may not be as thick as the others but for what I need they are great and saves me so much money!! I did wash them by hand after reading the reviews of others, just wasn't sure if they would warp because I don't know the temp on my dishwasher. I ordered two sets. Super excited about this deal!! I definitely would order again!"
"The containers were smaller than I expected even after reading the size before purchasing them. Overall they are good quality and at a great price in my opinion. I would recommend them for meal prep as long as you aren‚Äôt a heavy eater. Also storing small amounts of other items I think would work fine and they‚Äôre stackable, the appearance of them wouldn‚Äôt look bad, but again you‚Äôd have to use multiple containers to fit more items. Overall would recommend."
"I bought these in 2018 for Thanksgiving leftovers. The family loved them. Several are still in use 2.5 years later. They survived the dishwasher, microwave, fridge (never tried the freezer). We didn't experience any leaks and I don't recall any accidental openings while in transit. I would totally recommend and would buy again."
These are awesome not only for food but also for crafting items and more!!!! I love how I can see exactly what‚Äôs in it and can use it for my smaller items. I‚Äôll be buying more in the future. I also love that they are stackable! The covers have ridges that allow another container bottoms to stack.  For more of my ideas http://www.amazon.com/shop/lifespreciousdestinyphotography
"These seem to do the job perfectly. I feed my dog raw and I wanted to stop using plastic bags in my preparation of her food (about 30 days at a time). They are compact, fit just about her 14oz of food per day, the kids stay in place in the freezer, and they are pretty easy to see the contents. I've not put them in the dishwasher because they're simple to hand wash and I prefer not to put plastic in there."
"Was looking for a bundle to do around a month of food prepping and so glad I chose these. They hold the perfect amount, very durable, the lids snap on and hold with ease. The only downside is if it is soup or liquid base it will leak still if tilted. I had to make sure they weren't completely full. Otherwise, perfect for the use and will be ordering more in the future.  Pros- Great quality for price Durable Ease of use with lids  Cons- Not completely leak proof"
"My go to storage containers. I now make my own dog food, one full container is equal to 2 cans dog food. I also pre make soups, sauces, etc. Perfect size. These stack perfectly in the freezer and don't fall over easily like so many do."
"Honestly I was expecting cheap, thin, containers that wouldn't last long. We've been using them pretty heavily now for several months and I haven't thrown one away. They don't melt in the microwave. They haven't gotten brittle or cracked. They're a good size and the lids fit well. Rectangular containers fit so much better in the fridge."
"I ordered these and liked them so much in my kitchen that I ordered another set to use for general storage around the house. They stack neatly in my refrigerator and pantry for food items. They hold up well for use in the freezer or microwave, I run them thru my dishwasher with no problems. They also come in handy in the garage and bathroom to hold small items. Since they're clear, you can easily view what's stored in them. I consider this an excellent purchase."
"These are thin-walled, so I don't recommend them for use in the microwave, but for basic food storage they're excellent. They stack nicely to save space. I use them for storing all kinds of things in the fridge from diced onions, lime wedges, guacamole, shredded cheese, etc. These containers have MANY uses and I love the way they stack and save space in my fridge."
"I bought a 50 pack of these in 2018, because I wanted to clear the Hodge-poge of different size containers out of the cabinet. I also wanted them price low, so I need not ask people we gave food to to return the containers. These solved both problems. Wife and I have run them through our extra hot dishwasher loads, for years without damage. I just ordered a second batch, because we gave away so many. Very satisfied!"
"I've had these for quite awhile now. I threw out all of my old food storage containers & opted to have all of them the same size to make life easier. Im so pleased with these. They clean so easily, are dishwasher and microwave safe and I haven't had any issues with even tomato sauce staining them. Definitely recommend"
"This looks really pretty and makes your spices look organized and neat, but the glass is very thin and you have to be very careful when using it and also washing it. My mother in law washed and cleaned all of them when they arrived the first day and one of them already broke while she was washing it. Nice to have your spices organized finally but I wish the glass was more durable."
Love these jars! Easy to clean
"My kitchen cabinet looks more organized, it makes my cooking easy."
"These are very beautiful jars, but extremely then glass, so you will need to be careful. Otherwise, they still up nice and are beautiful :-)"
These are rlly good to keep food in like chia seed and ect I rlly like them. But the marker doesn‚Äôt rlly stay on you have to keep applying.
"I am returning them because the glass is so thin and they seem to be so fragile, I'm afraid they will break and I don't want to deal with that."
I use the containers for my stuff that really needs to stay very dry.
"These are nice, but didn‚Äôt realize how thin the glass quality would be. One of the lids had a small crack."
The product is good. But needs to be handled with care.
I like its easy to clean and it's style.
"Pretty good seel on these but I still add a little plastic wrap to my brown sugar just to be on the safe side. Container holds a whole five pound bag of brown sugar with a little room leftover. The silicone rings around the lids are removable for cleaning, which is beneficial. The only down side to this is sometimes the silicone ring comes off when opening the lid. Pretty pleased with this set. The packaging was really good as well."
This jars are great. So far my brown sugar hasn't lost moisture. Lids fit great and the glass is a sturdy thickness. The one thing I don't like is how cheap the labels feel. My labels were placed where they became damaged from opening the box. The labels are really flimsy.
"Nice, solid airtight food storage jar. Wooden lid that is easy to remove and place back on. And holds anything but liquid. Looks good as decor on the counter or as organization in your cabinet. Very good price for the quality, highly recommend."
Big enough for snacks or dry pasta ( spaghetti is cut in half) bamboo lids are soft with a good sealing when closing them. Very nice option for pantry organization.
I was in need of jars to organize my pantry items. The material of the jars durable and good to preserve various things. I
I like these containers for storing my powders to make smoothies. I had bought some but they were too small and these are longer and larger!  I can fit the entire bag in this container with no issue. These are an asset to my kitchen smoothie station. ‚ù§Ô∏èüèÜ‚ù§Ô∏è I would buy them again as well!
Loved the aesthetic look with bamboo lid and thick glass.
I used these for my spices and I Iove them.
J‚Äôadore! Chic et pratique üòä La seule chose que je corrigerais est l‚Äô√©tanch√©it√© des couvercles.
Used them for spice jars. Adds some style to the kitchen. Loving the bamboo wood covers.
Good size.
I use it for my loose herbal teas.
"Product is great but description is misleading, ordered 9 set, but got only 8 delivered."
"It comes in a pack of 8, not 9 as described so that should be corrected because it is misleading. I would have bought a different set if knew I wouldn‚Äôt have 9 of them but no big deal, they are still cute‚Ä¶ I did not expect to much when I saw them with regard to the durability and as I thought, the glass is kind of thin and seams easily breakable. They are more for the look!"
one of the 9 arrived broken . Sucks I needed 8 . Who takes responsibility for damaged goods ? Shouldn't be the paying customer ????
"I prefer single compartment containers, I don‚Äôt want to limit what I meal prep. I‚Äôve boight similar containers before ‚ÄúFitpacker‚Äù brand 15 for $20. These are the basically the same bought so much more value. I normally prep 30 meals a week, lunch and dinner for five day and for three people. These things are easy to clean and cheap to replace if needed."
"I was reordering this multiple times for months in a row because these were pretty durable, inexpensive, easy to use, and held a good amount of food.  NOW, all of a sudden they appear to be coming in at barely half the volume that they used to - the right picture is before, and the left is from my last order. I doubt they're whatever volume that they claim to be anymore. I will NOT be reordering these!"
I have been an avid meal prepper for over 2 years. Containers are important! So first part for me is that they stack up together and take up very little space. I love that they are okay to go in the microwave. I also have put these in the freezer with no issues. like other plastics they do get greasy and you need to make sure you are using enough detergent on them to get them clean. This is not an issue for me however my male counterpart seems to be riding the stuggle bus with this concept.  I wish these came slightly smaller too. I would buy a whole other set!
"I bought these meal prep containers to freeze about a month's worth of food. I cook a lot of food and freeze it in these containers, then when you get home from work the food is already cooked, just heat and eat. If you decide you want to go out then it will be ready for a meal later. No wasteful dumping of food because it spoils. The containers are wonderful, about the right size for one meat for one person. Very well made and re-useable. Thank you. Jo"
These got great reviews so I ordered them. I am not having the same experience. The lids are all cracking the first time I put them on. 90% of the lids will be useless after the first use. They all crack in the same spot. They are also very hard to get fully closed. Very disappointed!
"In many ways, these are wonderful - I use them for leftovers and for packing lunch for school. BUT. The lids are absolute garbage. They crack if you look at them sideways. Sure, they are inexpensive, but I would rather pay more for something with more longevity than something I get maybe 2 uses out of. Maybe make the tops of the more durable material the bottoms are made of? Next time, I'll buy something else."
These are nice and heavy duty containers and well worth the money. my only real complaint is that I wish the lids locked down a little bit better. They're great if you're just storing stuff in the freezer or refrigerator with them but traveling with them the woods might not be quite as secure as they could be.
"These are just as advertised. I bought them use in a Hot Logic mini, and they have worked perfectly so far. I've used them to portion out a large pot of soup. They work well, although they are not completely leak proof. With the soup (it has a thin broth) you would not turn them on their sides or upside down when thawed. But that is not a real problem unless you try to make it one. All the containers and tops were all in good condition when they arrived with no broken or unusable pieces. I've pulled one out of the freezer and opened and closed it with the temperature of the container about -10‚Ñâ. It was a little stiffer, but I had no problems and it did not crack or break while really cold, which is where I would expect it to be most brittle. I heated a container of soup in the microwave (which I rarely use to reheat) and it didn't become soft, warp or distort. They work really well in the Hot Logic mini for reheating and the size is perfect. I was pleased that they cleaned up well. I also have and use Ziplock containers, that are not as easy to get the grease and oils off when washing. I have not put one through the dishwasher, so I don't know how they will hold up there, but I rarely use my dishwasher preferring to wash by hand. The size is good. It will hold a good hearty portion when filled, so they'll be versatile. I also like how well they nest while empty, and stack when filled. They use space efficiently, which is a plus when pre-making meals. So thus far I am happy with the purchase and would not hesitate to reorder. Good bang for the buck. Remember, these are cheap plastic containers and they are not something you are going to be handing down to your grandchildren. These are semi-disposable containers. If I get 2 or 3 uses I will be satisfied, more will be icing on the cake. From my limited experience so far, I think I will be very pleased."
"I actually loved this product. People never return your plastic containers when you send them food so these are perfect for personal use. Even better they hold an adhesive label well and are great for catering lunches or single meals to local businesses. Salads, Hot Foods, Cold Foods, Refrigerate or Microwave. These are going to be stock items with us."
"I bought these for doing meal prep for me and my wife following the birth of our child. They work perfectly for the task. The containers are the same type that you would get from ordering at a Thai restaurant or similar establishment. They are dishwasher safe and store approximately enough for one meal for one person. Oily foods or foods with fat or butter will leave an oily residue on the container unless you use heat and a more concentrated amount of elbow grease and soap. Be careful while shaking them off when drying them, because they are brittle and tend to shatter if you smack them on a hard surface by mistake. They microwave well and take 4 minute sessions in my 1100 watt microwave with no issues or noticeable warping. On a related note, I hadn't taken portion control seriously until I purchased these meal prep containers. In the past month, I have lost about 2-3 pounds per week, but that's a combination of midnight changings, stress, and portion control. Still, I have appreciated the weight loss and plan on replacing these with the same product once enough of them get cracked from me smacking them around too much."
"At first I was concerned these were too small. They weren't as deep as the ones they replaced... but then Wing Night came. I mean, I use them for other things... I make a gallon of homemade frozen fruit yogurt at a time and they're perfect for servings... and I use them for leftovers. But Wing Night... that was the night we decided they would stay with us til they were worn out and needing to be tossed. They'll hold 5 or 6 full wing sets and sauce for shaking...perfect for individual needs. Win, win. They aren't as strong as I'd hoped... but I still think I'll get half a dozen uses out of them before they're worn out. We'll see. I'll update this review as time goes on. Enjoy!"
"I really like these! There are a lot of reviews with people unhappy they didn‚Äôt last longer, but in reality we all know they aren‚Äôt selling a whopping 50 life time indestructible meal prep containers for only $22.99....I figured they would last a few uses each time and I am pleased to report they are holding up great. If you take the time to close the lid one corner at a time and also remove it the same way they last longer...just don‚Äôt wait so long to eat that you rip the lid off in a hangry state and then get mad the plastic broke. Happy meal prepping people!"
"These are amazing. I am chronically ill and lack the energy to cook for myself very often so when I do these meal containers are great for cooking in bulk and freezing individual portions. 50 containers is also way more than it sounds like, we've been using new ones every time for like a month and still haven't run out of them! They freeze well, reheat well, and they wash fine on the top rack of the dishwasher. When heating in the microwave for an extended period, throw the lid underneath for stability when carrying as it gets a little flexible once it gets really hot (like if you make easy mac or Ramen in it) but no bad plastic smell or anything and it hasn't damaged my containers at all."
"No one eats left overs at my house with 3 young adult kids you would think it would have none .... They just go bad. I am also a professional cook so I have a hard time downsizing my proportioning..... Luckily my BF needs lunch everyday at work. I proportion the remaining meal after dinner into these convenient Containers, label with masking tape and permanent ink and toss into the freezer... He picks the meal he like and tossed it into his lunch box.... By lunch it's almost unthawed and microwaves them for lunch. These have saved me money, time and waste.  I have done Chili to curry and rice to salad in these no leaks."
"I can no longer stand long enough to cook. I have friends that cook for the two of us and bring the food in the containers. We reheat and eat. My husband washes the containers and puts them in a sack to return to the original owner. We have used single compartment for things like soup, chili and spaghetti. The two sided container contained steak and baked potato and the three compartment container have contained chicken, mashed potatoes/gravy and green beans. This is just some of the meals we have received. Right now we have 2 single containers in the freezer with home made spaghetti sauce. All my husband (a non cooker) needs to do is boil noodles, heat sauce and pour over noodles. A great meal!"
"These containers were perfect for the food we served to our bball players after their game. The containers were easy to handle & allowed the players to fill their containers, snap them securely w/o leakage concerns & enjoy their meal later. Super that the containers are microwavable & easy to wash; however, knowing the ways of (most) of the boys, & since they were on a road trip, it was more convenient to just throw them away...much to the dismay of the mothers who would have loved to wash & reuse these wonderful containers. They will certainly be a repeat purchase for our next ""to go"" dinner."
I was pleasantly surprised at how many were in the order! I use them for dog mean planning when I send them to the kennel for any overnight stays. I can use a Sharpie to put their name on the front lid and identify 'breakfast' or 'dinner'. The lid is a good secure fit for fresness and so nothing spills. Fill them up and stack them. The kennel loves the stackability and it's really organized. Excellent product for food prep for human or animal.
"These are so perfect. They stack so they save so much space. They hold about a quart of leftovers. Or a great salad, or you sandwichs and some veggie snacks or chips. Microwave and dishwasher safe. I have had no problems. Leave the lid ajar in the microwave and top rack only in the dishwasher and no heated dry. When they wear out I can toss them without guilt as they are only about 50 cents each. Will leak with soup or liquidy foods."
"Good product for the price. Fairly sturdy. I filled some and gave them as a gift to someone who rarely gets home cooking. He said they did not leak and were fairly easy to clean. I gave it only 4 stars in the ""easy to clean"" category, not because there is anything wrong with these containers, but simply because plastic seems more difficult to de-grease than other mediums. Portion size is just right for single servings. For bigger appetites, fill two! These are great when you cook in quantity and want to put left-overs in the freezer. Makes for a quick, easy, homemade meal."
I love these food prep containers! The lids are raised so you can over stuff. They don't get melt spots from over heating in the microwave. They don't stain from chili or spaghetti sauce. They stack in the fridge and cabinet so well! There's so many uses for them. I don't think 50 is enough!!!! I bought bowls too. They are leak proof and great for left over soup and beans.
"I love these sturdy, reusable containers. They have solved the problem of sending leftovers with friends and family and keeping track of whose containers are whose. I don't expect them back, but since they are reusable my friends frequently use them to send food home with me. They are the perfect size; and since they are freezer, microwave, and dishwasher safe I portion my leftovers and freeze them for later. The uniform size makes storing them easy in the treezer. I have gifted several friends with a shipment and they love them too!"
"I bought these food containers as I cook for several of my neighbors on a regular basis, and my storage containers were not being returned to me, and it was getting costly to keep replacing! This was a perfect solution, as they can either be reused or thrown out when they are empty. I have had no issues with leaking food or any complaints. Great value too"
"I was looking for a semi-disposable lunch container for work. I have tried and failed several times to take containers to and from, clean them, not leave them in the car, etc. etc. etc. For whatever reason my monkey brain wont let me execute this task to any level of success.  So, I found in these, a container that was quality enough to take to work, wash, and reuse maybe 2-3 times without issue, however, if I forgot it in the car or whatever, it was cheap enough to not fret over throwing away a few.  I buy a 50 pack like twice a year and it covers my entire year of taking lunches, including forgetting and tossing a few."
"use these to prepare frozen entrees for some elderly family members-I put veggies in some, meat in others and noodles, rice or potatoes in others-and of course desserts- usually bread puddings or crumbs- apple, blue berry etc- this way they can mix and match their meals-I label each one using painters tape- they stack easily in the freezers, they are easy for them to open and microwave- plus they wash up great in the dishwasher"
With Covid 19 rampant the fall-winter of 2020 we didn't celebrate holidays in person with family. I still cooked holiday meals and boxed them up in these containers and dropped them off for the kids/ grandkids. The containers worked well and the meals were appreciated. I love cooking and usually make enough for a small army so I box meals in these containers frequently for grandkids and drop them off.
"These containers are perfect for leftovers and for freezing. I like the size of these containers, as they will hold a large serving. I don't think the lids would fit tight enough to guarantee they wouldn't leak if turned on their side. That is not an issues for me, as I stack them in my refrigerator and freezer. These wash well in the top rack of the dishwasher. I'd definitely order these again."
I purchased these so that my husband and a roommate could take the leftovers of dinners to work for lunches and not worry about my good dishes coming back home. Overall the containers are decent however I simply wish they were slightly larger as both guys are larger and tend to eat more. I have not tried or tested to see if they are leak proof. They are fairly easy to clean however I have not cleaned many of them as they tend to toss them out and not reuse. They are good in the microwave and have not seemed to melt when reheating leftovers.
"Ever wonder how to store that left over Chinese food. Voil√†, here it is. Just place that extra Chinese food in one or more of these and not only are they great storage, but microwave safe too.  They even are great safe storage for those foam take out containers.  Just place them in the dishwasher, and they are reusable.  And for you singles out there. They are great for storing butter quarters."
"I really like having these on hand. Great for when I have guests over and I want them to take leftovers. People really appreciate the convenience of not having to take food home in a paper plate with foil or clear wrap, which are really unreliable and messy. And the best thing is that these are microwavable. It‚Äôs just a thoughtful thing to have these handy for guests ‚Äì or myself of course."
"I bought these just before Christmas. My family has a wide variety of food preferences ( vegan, low carb etc) so there is always a lot of left overs that my husband and I don‚Äôt want. At the end of the meal, each family makes a plate or two to take home. The containers are leak proof, the perfect size and stack well in the refrigerator. You will find all kinds of uses for them. Highly recommended!"
"They‚Äôre great! They do the job, hold all the food I need them to hold, and super price for the amount you get. As far as being easy to clean? There are lots of little spaces you kinda gotta get into prior to popping in the dishwasher if your food sticks to the containers. It‚Äôs no biggie, though. This will be the only container I use for meal prep this competition season. Thanks!"
"I love these containers. I store single meal servings, vegetables and all, and label and freeze them. I use both leftovers and special made meals. When busy (or just hungry), just take one from the freezer, remove the lid and put the base container in the microwave. I use the sensor reheat button on my microwave - the meal is thawed and heated to perfection. They are great gifts for busy friends and invalids, too."
"Love, love, love these containers! I pack home cooked lunches and dinners for my nephew who is a freshman in a college nearby. I‚Äôm very happy that these containers are microwaveable so that he can heat up the food. I don‚Äôt worry about getting them back, although, I reuse mine after washing in the dishwasher. It‚Äôs a win win!"
"For anyone who does food prepping or wants to send leftovers home with someone but you don't want to give up your good containers, these are the perfect containers for you! They hold a good amount of food (easily one serving each of a protein, starch and veggie), they're really sturdy (not like some other flimsy brands), the lids lock super tight (no leakage) and clean up easily in the sink or the dishwasher. I really appreciate how easy they are to store in your cupboard until you're ready to use them as well as how easy they stack in the fridge. Absolutely microwave friendly - they don't warp or bend or absorb any food. Great buy and will definitely buy them again when I run out."
"A 50-pack makes for a lot of plastic containers floating around. I actually live in a house molded out of them now. All kidding aside, they work well, although one time there was a leak when it ended up sideways in my girlfriend's lunch bag. It does not say on the actual plastic containers whether or not they are dishwasher safe (and let's be honest... I was so excited to receive these bad boys that I threw the packaging right out the window), so I put them in the top rack only. They didn't warp at all."
These are the perfect containers for meal prep or storing leftovers. I‚Äôve microwaved them and put them through the dishwasher numerous times and they‚Äôve still held up very well.
"These containers are similar to one I purchased recently at a clearance sale. We found we actually used these to store and reheat leftovers. So I went in search of a similar item. This worked very well, the construction is strong and although I have not washed these multiple times as yet, I feel that they are worth the price even as a ""single use"" or to share a meal with a neighbor."
"These food containers are useful for sharing portioned meals with others. Because they are reusable they are perfect for ‚Äòtrading‚Äô food items with family members or friends. The cost for 50 packs are reasonable and since they are washable and reusable that makes them even more desirable. Also, we bought 2 different sizes (16 oz and 32 oz)!"
I love these. I use them for community dinner up 60 people. Because of Covid We did a drive-through and they were very excited to know that their containers were microwavable and dishwasher safe
"These containers are just what I need. They are a great size, and seal tightly. I can stack two on top of each other on my thin refrigerator shelf. When I have company, and I want to give them some food to take home, these are perfect because if I do not get them back, I do not have to chase after them. I wash and reuse them all the time. One heads up though, When you wash them take the time to use plenty of hot water and a good dish soap. The plastic has a slight tendency to hold onto any oil from the food."
The thing that makes me happier about this product is how sturdy the containers are and the ability to just put them into the dishwasher so we have ZERO waste. I don't have to feel terribly about using plastic when it is durable. I have washed one of my containers over and over again on the hottest setting of my professional dishwasher and the lid and container is still sturdy and not melted by the machine. GREAT QUALITY! Thank you!
These containers are very nice. They are sturdy and hold a lot of food. It makes putting left overs away a lot easier. The containers were packaged very well and shipping was fast. I will definitely be buying more if I need to do so. I even gave a few to my daughter for her to try.
"I wanted to start making meals for my dad to help him eat healthier. And so I bought this pack to store his food in. It is exactly what I expected it to be. I wouldn't say that it is the best, but it's what you get for the money and quantity. It is a pretty good product for what it is. Works well for meal prepping, easily stackable, and easy to clean."
"I find these great for leftovers. My husband can take the left overs to work and reheat them. Not out much money if he doesn't bring it back home. Very nice and not expensive. They do not leak and can be washed in the dishwasher and re used. The size is perfect for many left overs. I have used them for pasta, hot dishes, meat entries, desserts and even a slice of three layer cake. I have also sent home left over to family and friends. They all like them too, as they do not need to return the containers and it can be re used. Plus they look nice. A lot better looking and I would guess safer to use than a used whip cream or cottage cheese bowl."
"Great product! I have used these for meal prep, meals, second servings and organizing. I have used them repeatedly and they took a beating. Easy to clean by hand or dishwasher. Functional size for food portion and storage in the fridge."
"My brother and I are on a diet. So when I prepare my food, I give him some portions in these containers. The container are the perfect size, and I love that I can reuse them over and over. Can be used in the freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe. A winner!"
This product is an authentic and suitable food container I have used for my three school-going kids. I would call it the best lunch box for the schoolgoers. I have used multiple time same containers for five days straight. Very easy to stack and keep in a cabinet. Life is easy because you don't need to find and wash it in the 11th hour before leaving for school.  The coolest part is the strong structure which fits well in the school bag without getting smashed between thick textbooks. I would highly recommend this container because of the fitting compartment and usability.
"I not only use these in the freezer, microwave and dishwasher for food products, but also for storage of many different things. It is perfect for small crafting item. The clear lid makes it easy to find what you need."
"Now my family members can keep the containers that they take from our family meals as leftovers and not worry about returning them. Every home should have these, they are perfect for many uses, in the kitchen, garage, work bench, craft table, etc."
"First time purchasing from this seller. Was able to get product in, timely, fashion. Able to get the quantity I wanted, without being a member of a restaurant supply company or being a business owner to get into a restaurant supply warehouse.  Purchased so that dinner guest have a container, for take away. Perfect.  Will purchase, again."
I‚Äôve been meal prepping for my neighbor for a few months and really needed these. They certainly came in handy. High oil content dishes take longer to clean off of the containers but they‚Äôre suitable and can be used multiple times. I‚Äôm satisfied with this product.
"My husband and I are always on the go - whether it be to work or for kids‚Äô sports or whatever. These are absolutely perfection and ridiculously convenient. They‚Äôre the perfect size for taking a salad, fruit, leftovers, whatever to work every day. They work wonderful in the kids‚Äô lunchboxes, and are ideal for packing snacks for the kids. We‚Äôve always used baggies in the past, but these are a much better substitute to that. And as an extra plus - they wash up great and can be reused over and over again."
"I bought these food containers so family members could share in any leftovers after large gathering. We used up at more than half of these - they work great. Very pleased with the quality of containers & lids. Also, worked great in microwave and stack good in freezer."
You can't beat this giant stack of containers. Doesn't crack or warp like others I've used. A++
It is perfect in everyway. I have ordered them a few times. The covers fit well and food does not leak. I like the fact that you can take off the cover and warm the food it contains in the microwave.
These are meant to be disposable so don't hold expectations they'll last like Tupperware. I purchased these to take on a month long trip across the country. They were the perfect size to use for our meals while we travelled. We saved a ton of money by having healthy food ready to take out of the cooler and eat at a park or rest stop. It was very convenient to just toss these in the trash when we were done and go. We had some extras after the trip that we have run through the dishwasher and they last about five uses before cracking.
"These meal prep plates are so nice and sturdy. There was no odor upon opening the package, and they are truly dishwasher safe if used in the top rack. I‚Äôm really glad I bought them, and would recommend to others."
These are probably the best containers I‚Äôve ever bought in my whole entire life the fact that they‚Äôre reusable washable and there‚Äôs 50 of them I only have at least 10 of them in rotation right now so it‚Äôs so nice compared to other Tupperware where you lose the lid you have to find the right lid for the right size it‚Äôs literally so annoying so this is such an awesome purchase
"I got tired of buying so much Tupperware only for it to disappear. I saw these and thought it was perfect for left overs, to go lunches, and makes a great salad shaker! This is a great alternative to Tupperware and I don't have to try to find matching lids anymore. I would order these in the future if needed again."
Ordered for my daughter and son in law since they prep food for the week due to their workout routine. They stated they were perfect for their needs and the quality was great. Thought they may be flimsy due to quantity for the price but they were just has good as the ones would pay a couple dollars apiece for. This was a very very good buy!!!
These were perfect for what I needed - single serve meals for a friend who is going through aggressive cancer treatments - and I was able to pack a freezer full of food (I ordered two 50 packs of these containers). I only wish the lids would seal a little more snuggly.
"Our church provides two meals for those who are hungry each weekend. One of the meals is hot, and these containers are very easy to use, transport and keep.. the lid keeps leakage down and the size is perfect."
"Don't expect to reuse these. You might get a couple of uses out of them, but I'd consider these disposable. This type of plastic isn't recyclable in my area. And after that big NPR bombshell on plastic not actually being recyclable, I probably won't buy these again. But for the price point, and the usefulness of the product, 5 stars."
"Let me just say I search for price comparison, discounts etc. My first time purchasing and let me just say for the amount of money you spend buying at retail store, this is well worth it. Other products I must let them soak overnight to remove grime/grease from left over food.  NOT THIS ONE!! Clean up is easy, and no build up.. will continue to purchase.."
"Containers are a good size, lids snap on nice & tight, stood up to freezing, microwaving, and dishwasher. Perfect for meal prep or meals for friends that you don't have to worry about getting the container back from."
"I hostess a lot of potlucks. It is our habit to divide up the leftovers and take them home either for ourselves or for family members who missed the party. The deal is to wash them and return them next time. Needless to say in time they must be replaced which is why I ordered these. I just love them. There are plenty for everyone to use and if someone forgets theirs or they are appropriated for friends lunch boxes, at this price, who cares? These beat the heck out of wondering where your expensive Tupperware went off to."
Found these on a daily deal for $17. I‚Äôd buy 4 more sets if I could find them again for this price. Now all I‚Äôm seeing is $40-50. Great containers. Have handled heat well. Dropped a few frozen and they just cracked. Others I have if I‚Äôve droped them frozen they throw plastic pieces all through my food. Hope they go on sale again!
"These are so helpful for packing lunch, saving left overs etc. I actually have been using these more than my more expensive food storage set just because they stack so nicely in the cabinet and are easier to clean. One crack in a lid so far after a months use and probably my own doing but I have so many and theyre so cheap that I really didnt mind."
"With a Picnic You have Food, LOTS of Snacks and Lots of Dessert!! These really help keep everything separated and in a container that can be easily cleaned and re-used over and over. They also make excellent containers make excellent for toys and other FUN things you take on a Picnic!!! Pictures will be posted once her Birthday Picnic has taken place. (Sh's not allowed onto the web and so my secret hopefully wont be spoiled."
"I Went with these over a few other brands because 50 for 24.99 ... 50 cents each cannot go wrong !! I love them they are amazing easy to use, clean, freeze em, microwave em, dishwasher safe!! BUY THESE!! I‚Äôm gonna order more incase they sell out LOL"

I love these jars. They come in a variety of sizes and are so stylish. The lid is a simple lift-off but they silicon is strong enough to keep it airtight.
"This was the best product that I have purchased. The storage is a breeze to complete and items can be identified because of the glass. Also, the glass is not thin and of good quality."
"These look great in my kitchen. I bought small knobs, separately and glued them to the lid, which does make opening them a bit easier. They have a great air-tight seal. The glass is a little thin but if handled with care, should last a long time. Very happy with this purchase!"
"I love the appearance and functionality of these jars! This is one of my favorite products I have purchased for my kitchen. They are easy-to-clean, great quality, and airtight. I love the variety of sizes available as well!"
Me encanta el toque ‚Äúboho‚Äù que le a√±ade a mi cocina. Trae 5 envases (tal como dice la descripci√≥n) y s√≥lo le agregu√© esas etiquetas que hacen que se vea todo mas organizado. F√°ciles de limpiar y muy √∫tiles. No he encontrado nada malo que decir. üíØ
"These are great. Stylish. Perfect for my nutritional cabinet. I store protein powder, hemp nuts, chia seeds and other nuts. Had to order another set. That good!"
Handy snd nice looking
I really ordered for the price but got so much more than I paid. They look so sleek and high end. So happy I bought them.
Holds over 1:2 gallon. Good seal with lid!
"The set arrived well packaged, no broken items. The glass was nice and sturdy, loved the wide openings, made it easy to pour into. The kids were nice and snug fit. Would recommend"
I will be buying more of these.
"I love these jars, they are beautiful in my kitchen and I love that they are different sizes!"
"Strong, so cute, helpful I love it"
"Stylish, simple design. These can be used for more than just kitchen counter storage. So happy I found this set!"
"Great for storing flour and sugar. Modern, clean look. Airtight."
"The glass jars came exactly as I had hoped, and they're all very nice!"
Nice
"Functional and looks great! Also, packaged well!"
"I have really high expectations for these jars because of the reviews but when I opened mine, one of the jars had a chip on it!!! There was also a stain like it had been used before. I still wanted to keep the item but I couldn‚Äôt return just one jar so I contacted customer service‚Ä¶ got a $6 refund for it. Pretty bummed."
"Would love the option to purchase same product as individuals also. If they would I‚Äôd order extra of the medium size. I love them but they may be difficult for some. As they are glass, which means they are slick and some people may have difficulty grabbing for quick use. I am cautious when I go to get them to use. Glass isn‚Äôt super thick which helps to keep them lighter but if dropped I‚Äôm sure they would shatter. I will likely purchase another set soon if I can‚Äôt find just the medium size ones."
I love em! Great price and excellent quality.
"These break way too easily. I know they‚Äôre glass but most of my kitchen is filled with glass jars, dishes, etc and I‚Äôve never had one break before I could even use it. Took it out of the package. Washed it. Set it on the counter with the lid on it. My son accidentally bumped the lid, it fell in and it shattered the jar. So it‚Äôs now in the recycling bin and I never even had a chance to use it. Hopefully the other 4 hold up better."
Great looking and well made. I was happily surprised!
Very attractive. Great calue
For the price is worth it. If you're getting it for pasta you will need to use 2 jars for 1 box of pasta. Only the large one will fit an entire box if pasta.
So the glass has bumps running all the way down on 2 sided of the container. The tops look like they've been scratched or used. Not sure that it's brand new.
I‚Äôm just not sure these are for me. They are beautiful and highly recommended for your home. Just not sure they match my home. Very nice

"They placed a plastic seal on the lid. It took me an hour to pull the lid out. Even witout the seal, it would be hard to use the lid to push in, to pull out."
"This is very nice Glass Jar with Lid Set of 5,Stackable Kitchen Canisters Set.  It has Two Small,Two medium,and One Large. We are stop using plastic Container for food. I am searching for glass Container in online and am so glad that I happen to come across this glass Jar set,100% lead-free ,non-toxicis, is healthier than plastic jars.  It has different sizes So i put different shape of food in the glass jars and it can perfectly fit in to cardboard and specially to talk about wooden lids which are air-tight seal, keep food fresh longer and protect against air moisture or bugs even kids can open very easily . Great for wet or dry foods.  I just put them in the dishwasher with good results. I clean the bamboo lids by hand. I am very Happy this purchase and Highly recommended."
"I have some glass canisters similar to this but wanted one that had a canister tall enough for spaghetti noodles and this set does! I‚Äôm terrible about sizing of products so I was so happy with these lol! This set comes with five glass canisters, bamboo lids and a brush to clean them. They were easy to clean. The glass is a good thickness and they seal nicely. The two smaller canisters was able to hold 5 cookies each. I had a different style of cookie that‚Äôs bigger circles and those would not fit into any of the canisters. I‚Äôm going to use them for my flour, sugar, etc but I wanted to get an idea on size. I like the look of these canisters!"
"You get a set of 5 glass storage jars. Two small ( 3.9"" wide x 3.9"" tall), two medium ( 3.9"" wide x 7.87"" tall), and one large (3.9"" wide x 11.8"" tall). The largest one seems a little tall for the base and might tip if bumped. Looks like it's made for spaghetti or other things that are tall and narrow. These jars are made of borosilicate glass, so they're sturdier than other types of glass. They came well-packaged and none were damaged. The bamboo lids have a silicone ring that creates an airtight seal. These lids are easy to remove and put on (which I really appreciate). The straight sides of the jar make it easy to clean, and you can just put them in the dishwasher with good results. I clean the bamboo lids by hand. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. They look great and are easy to use."
"I ordered these jars for an unusual purpose.¬† I use them to store small wooden puzzles with uniquely-shaped pieces.¬† They are very high quality puzzles, but each manufacturer packages them differently and I wanted them to have a uniform appearance when displaying them.¬† I glue a photo of each puzzle on the lid to its jar and cover it in a layer of shellac.¬† They look beautiful in these thick, high-quality glass jars with tight-fitting bamboo lids."
This is a beautiful set of 5 lidded borosilicate glass jars. They are very well made with clear glass that shows no bubbles or cloudy areas. They each have a bamboo lid that sports a ring of food grade silicone to help keep the jars sealed tightly. There are 2- 7.87x3.9 inch and 2- 3.9x3.9 inch and 1- 11.81x3.9 inch. I am so in love with getting my pantry organized and the look of these canisters is exactly what I wanted. The price on this set of 5 jars is good coming in at just under $31 at the time of this review. I highly recommend.
"I finally shifted all my spices, herbs and beans to glass containers and i‚Äôm so glad i did that! This set of airtight glass containers is very elegant and beautiful. The set contains 5 assorted containers glass jars with wooden airtight lids. The set arrived in a well packed box. No space for damage. The glass itself is delicate but durable to be used for storing spices, beans, flour, baking supplies or candies They look very nice when used for organizing a kitchen cabinet. The lid is airtight so it will keep the food fresh inside for a long time Easy to open and close. The different sizes help in storing different stuff. They also make a nice candy or cookies containers on a kitchen island or on a coffee table They are all glass so they are very easy to wash and air dry. They don‚Äôt get food color stains or remains like plastic Very satisfied that i shifted all my storage containers to glass! Worth the money since they can be used for so many things and can be washed and reused in something else if needed Recommended! You will love them"
"I got these to replace my old plastic storage containers and they make a huge difference in the look of my pantry shelves. These are very modern in appearance, the silicone lid makes a nice tight fit and they make it really easy to spot where things are stored. The glass is fairly thin and I suspect they will not survive a whack against my granite counters or sink but I am not experimenting to find out! The tall jar does seem a bit taller than necessary to store spaghetti and it will not fit on my shelves. I have it on the counter right now filled with trail mix. It could have been an inch or more shorter and still held store bought spaghetti. Besides that, this is a really nice set."
"I live in a tiny house so my space is at a premium. I have a decent sized kitchen counter, but I've resisted using it as extra storage because I didn't want it to look cluttered. These completely solve that problem - they look great and the tall one is perfect for dry soba noodles. The other's are working beautifully for rice, oatmeal, protein powder and even dogs treats. It all looks fine on the counter and they've freed up some space in my cabinets. They're nicely made and solid feeling. The bamboo caps are stylish and with the silicone gasket, they seal nicely. I'm really happy with these."
"These jars have been all over the internet these past months and now that I have some, I totally get it. They are beautiful and make every kitchen so much prettier. The YUNCANG arrived perfectly packed and organized. They are gorgeous and the quality is GREAT. Super easy to clean and durable. The airtight has been working great so far and I use most of the jars everyday when cooking. I believe the best thing about this product is that the jars are stackable, which is great for storage and you can save so much more room with that. I LOVE these jars and recommend them to everyone!"
"The glass jar canisters match the smaller jars that I used to organize my spices. I was thrilled to find larger canisters for a consistent look in my pantry. The large jars are great for a variety of foods from pasta to nuts and cereal. The bamboo lids fit securely and air tight. The lids are easy to take on and off. The jars are made of glass and are fairly sturdy. Obviously, they would break if dropped but they can handle general kitchen use. They are easy to clean and come with a brush for ease of cleaning the taller canister. They come packaged securely in foam and plastic."
"This set of canisters is very clean and modern looking. They hold a lot, and look great in a grouping. The glass is crystal clear, so I don't need labels. The bamboo lid has a rubber gasket that insures a tight seal. The straight sides make it easy to get every last bit out, no sugar hiding in the corner! They are easy to clean and even came with a sponge scrubber which is long enough to reach to the bottom of even the tallest canister. I had one canister arrive broken, but customer service took care of the issue promptly. Hooray!"
I think these storage containers are my favorite kind out there. They look so classy and clean. I also love that the bamboo lids are easy to clean and dry. (A lot of other types of storage containers especially with 'lock' lids get water stuck in them and don't dry easily).  I like that this set has a variety of sizes. I was able to fit a whole box of macaroni elbows and rotini into each of the medium sized ones.
"I am using this set to store lentils and couldn't be happier. Well-made, lightweight, with tight sealing lids. This has improved an area of my pantry that was a hot mess. I can now easily find what I am looking for thanks to the clear glass base. This would make a great housewarming gift.  I recommend this set!"
"We are trying to get out of the plastic business in terms of food storage, and use as much glass as possible. It's always the lid that is the sticking point. Canning jar type lids aren't the most attractive, but these bamboo lids look really great. The seal seems to work well, so they appear to be quite air tight. This is a useful selection of sizes, and I do recommend this set for enhancing an attractive ""look"" on your kitchen counter or your pantry shelves."
"With these glass containers, you receive exactly what you see!  These are beautiful, simple glass jars that look wonderful on my counter. I now have five sizes and the combination has allowed me to store frequently used ingredients right on my counter!  10/10 would purchase these again for again! (Lol, it rhymes!)"
"They are stunning, go wonderful with farmhouse decor and they are very airtight to lock in freshness! The set has a variety of sizes that arrived well packaged and undamaged. Adds a special touch to my kitchen counters serving both as decor and as functional storage for any snacks i please. Beautiful!"
These jars look great! I have made it my mission to organize my pantry this year and still look good at the same time. These are great jars! They come in different sizes. I feel like the bamboo lids makes them stand out. The glass does feel a lot thinner so be careful as they will break easy.
These are just what I was hoping for they are large with space to fit spaghetti or any pasta except for lasagna. Lids have a good sealing they can be stack together but I prefer not to has the glass is thin and delicate.
"I love these glass jars for displaying my baking materials, my flour and sugar and brown sugar and oats and everything look like something out of better homes and gardens on my counter tops. The airtight seal works perfectly and keeps everything fresh and dry"
Beautiful canisters it‚Äôs a good place to keep all of your rice and beans and pasta fresh
"Great canister set, they are made well, the seal is nice and tight. No issues"
"These different sized glass jars are absolutely awesome! The look so nice on our kitchen counter. The seal at the top (on the lid) is sturdy and makes me think nothing will be getting in or out of these jars. My only complaint is one of them was broken when it arrived. Maybe a little better packing could have prevented that, but who knows! Overall, these glass jars for the kitchen are incredibly nice and very on trend! Will definitely be ordering more!"
"I've slowly been transitioning from store packaging to glass canisters for my dry goods in the pantry. This set is an interesting variety of sizes, so that's good; OK value at less than thirty bucks for 5 pieces. I still do prefer canisters that close from the outside‚Äîthese lids press into the canister, so they can't be filled completely.  The tallest one is kind of useless for me: my pantry shelves just aren‚Äôt high enough to accommodate it. I've used it as a vase for very long-stem flowers once, true. The other sizes work well for nuts, candy, and small pasta like orzo."
"These glass containers are nice. I use them to store my loose leaf teas that I drink regularly. They‚Äôre visually appealing and are made well. My biggest complaint is that the seal is only okay. I have a tea that has valerian root and if you know about it, you know it gives off a very unpleasant smell. The smell was eventually escaping my cabinet, which means the seal was not good. I finally switched that specific tea to a mason jar and haven‚Äôt smelt it since. So that being said, these are decent but not the best when it comes to airtight seal."
"These jars are perfect for storing food that needs an air tight container. The lids seal really tight, but are still easy to pop on and off. They hold a lot and stack nicely. I would definitely buy these again!"
"Really like the size, fits in kitchen perfect. However the glass is fragile so you must be very careful when cleaning or else it may crack easy. If glass was thicker I would surely order lots more."
Love the size variety
They look so good on my counter . I really like them.
These are beautiful
Super cute glass jars! They are perfect if you are looking to re-organize your pantry and put cute labels on them. Would recommend. And great price!
"These are ADORABLE. And I say that because I love mini things. These are SMALL. Especially the rectangular containers. Here is a size comparison to a standard paper towel roll. I'd judge that the circular ones would be the smallest option in a normal Pyrex set, so they're decent. You could easily fit a good amount of food/whatever in there. I dont know about the rectangular ones though because they are super tiny. But because of that, I love them. The print is good quality, I dont see it chipping/flaking away anytime soon. The lids fit a touch loosely, so I wouldn't reccomend storing liquid."
Love the design but lid is not good it says microwave okay but I used it in the microwave and it bent the lid permanently so don‚Äôt put the lid in the microwave at all! The kids are not leak proof so be aware!
nothing bad to say....i just love these! I guess watch out when you pull them from the oven? But I HOPE that's common sense. Great product!!!
Bought this as a birthday present for my brother and he absolutely loves it. Love the quality and the cute different images of baby yoda. They are smaller (but they say 3 and 4 cup in the description with the images) but are perfect for storing leftovers. Great for mandalorian lovers.
"I love Pyrex storage to begin with, and my husband loves Star Wars, so when I saw these come out, I pre-ordered them. They were a huge hit."
I‚Äôm a big Star Wars fan and my sister gave me this for Christmas and it‚Äôs one of my favorite presents! I already have a Pyrex rectangle and round bowl in the same size and they are the perfect size for taking leftovers to work for lunch. The glass is very sturdy and the lids seal well. Word of warning: don‚Äôt put the lid on while the food is still hot! Especially if you immediately put it in the fridge! The lids will warp over time and become concave and not seal as well. I‚Äôve had the other set for a few years and some lids have become concave but some haven‚Äôt so just be careful with them!
"Oh my goodness! I seen these in the store and my birthday was coming up and I told my husband I wanted them. I read everything to make sure I'd be happy.. ok they are great for leftovers.. marinating meat ( its only 2 of us),or making veggies really quick in the microwave. I have not put them in the oven only cause ppl said in reviews the decals will come off.. thats fine.. now I need the Darth Vader measuring cup!"
"So cute. Design is well done. Love that they are colorful and bright. I‚Äôve been slowly transitioning to glass food storage and I‚Äôve never had any problems with Pyrex. A Star Wars set is a no brainer. I doubt they are leak proof, but I don‚Äôt use them that for food transport/travel, so that works fine for me."
I gifted these to my work partner on his last day of work before transferring to another facility. He‚Äôs a huge fan of star wars and I wanted to get him something unique and practical! He‚Äôs the type of guy (straight out of college and young) that would bring his salad in a random plastic tub and throw his sandwich in with the salad in said plastic tub. I couldn‚Äôt wait to gift these to him! He absolutely loved these!
"What can I am say , these glass containers are so adorable . Love them !!! Hello it‚Äôs baby yoda !! You can not go wrong with these glass containers . Buy them !!"
These are a fun usuable product! I needed some new pyrex bowls and living with 2 roommates I didn‚Äôt want to get the traditional ones since its hard to label those so I stumbled upon these and they are great! I have put them through the dishwasher several times and they haven‚Äôt peeled or lost any of the characters on them and the seals on the lids are tight(not like the other reviews I‚Äôve read). Definitely worth the money!
"Not only are these foods containers absolutely adorable, but they're really practical! I have used and washed them (in the dishwasher!) dozens of times and the artwork is still perfect and the lids seal tightly. As an added bonus, it's fun to tell my kids that their lunch is in the Storm Trooper or Yoda Bowl!  Highly recommend! I may even order a second set! I use them every day!"
"I absolutely love the Star Wars designs on Pyrex. Awesome patterns and colors! The lids for the rectangular dish don't fit as snug as I would like, I just don't use them for foods that could leak. The round ones are great though."
"I LOVE these, they're so cute and give me an everyday opportunity to geek out as I eat lunch. I think they're great pieces, I do feel they're a little pricey for what you get....but then again, I still bought them. Like traditional pyrex dishes they're easy to clean, match lids with, etc. I would recommend."
"My mom is a huge Star Trek fan and was absolutely in love. I saw some other reviews about leaking, however my mom has used these many times since she got them Christmas Eve and she said she has had zero problems with leaking. A great purchase!"
"I only store food in glass Pyrex, and had to have these cute Star Wars prints the moment I saw them. Same price here as the Pyrex online store, but there you have to spend $100 for free shipping. They are the quality you expect from Pyrex."
"I purchased these as a gift for my daughter-in-law since she asked for them specifically. These work great, they are durable and go through the dishwasher easily. She is very happy with them."
This is a super cute product and the glass product is top of the line! I have no issues with leaks and have ran the glass and lid through the dish washer multiple times and have had no worries of the designs coming off.
"These are the perfect gift for anyone who loves to cook and loves Starwars, baby yoda is all over the glass and he looks so cute, I love these, my new favorite glass wear, Pyrex is awesome!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! The lids stay on tight, and the glass makes them easy to clean. These containers are study, and SUPER cute with the design on them."
I purchase because of the theme. They work great. I do not use them for liquids. The only bad this was one lid was stain after I put some pasta in it that had a tomato sauce. The stain it still there after a couple dozen washes.
"Got them for my husband the star wars fan, he loves them and gave me strict instructions that I was not to put them in the dishwasher, ever, because he wants to hand wash them and keep them looking new. They are dishwasher safe but you can bet your bippy I ain't washing them! They all come with lids that seal tight and are really cute."
"This set was a gift for my daughter - to make her meal prep more fun! She and her husband (and me too) really like the Mandalorian series, but especially ""Baby Yoda"". The set took a while to ship, but that was noted when I ordered so I was prepared."
I love all of the Pyrex Star Wars food storage containers. I bought a set of each for my sister and myself for Christmas. They‚Äôre fun to use and invoke happy memories of the Star Wars movies we‚Äôve enjoyed.
"I love pyrex and star wars so this was a must have. I have pyrex that's 20 us yrs old, I have no doubt this will last as well."
I needed some cute and fun Tupperware to make it easy to meal prep my lunches for work and these did the trick! I get so many compliments on them in the break room. I hand wash these only and the images have held up fine!
"Not only are these Star Wars themed, they are a good quality and they are hood sizes for leftovers."
"We love these containers, so cute but also very functional. The only downside is they can‚Äôt go in the dishwasher but they are very easy to clean so in my opinion great value!"
I love these baby yoda glass containers. I thought they microwaved well and did fine in the dishwasher.
Gave this as a gift for group lovers it's cute..but expect small...maybe a small casserole or salad
I think they are leak proof I just like the ones that snap close so you know it won‚Äôt leak everywhere
"My daughter loved this Christmas present so much! She loves Star Wars and it was a perfect gift, for her."
"My daughter loved these Pyrex Star Wars dishes. Thank you Pyrex for making beautiful, quality products!"
"I love how cute these containers are. They are perfectly sized for small meals, sandwiches, or snacks. Pyrex is great for heating up food in the oven or for baking. I love the cute Grogu design and sea green lids."
A very nice set of Pyrex. Very strong to last for years. I did find it cheaper elsewhere.
Super cute. I hope the Star Wars design won't fade of Input in the dishwasher. So far I've been hand washing to stay in the safe side.
Too cool We purchased a set for us and as a gift. Our friends love them as much as we do
My daughter loved the Pies Star Wars dishes! The colors were spot on! Thank you Pyrex.
It was a gift and I was told they work well and have a good seal with the lid
"Great product. Like all Pyrex products, they are good quality, easy to clean, and nice looking. The Star Wars decorations are super adorable. Just go ahead and buy this set. You will not regret this purchase."
"Very Cute Dishes, study, easy to clean. Lids fit well, convenient size."
This is a cute collection that is fun to carry your lunch in or pack away some leftovers.
Got a set for Christmas and had to buy another. Love them!
Super cute an really nice quality. Perfect for meal prepping or even making little baked goods.
The best glass lunchbox ever! Please do not microwave the lids. The lids are so cute and so are the baby yoda stickers.
"Pyrex is known for its durability, these are no different. It came Packaged very well and is so adorable for the Star Wars fans. Love it!"
Another collectable Star Wars item on my list.
"Pyrex is my absolute favorite brand of glass cooking dishes. They are basically indestructible and clean up so easy, never staining or darkening. The graphics on this set came perfect. The recipient loved them!"
Another collectable Star Wars item on my list.
Another collectable Star Wars item on my list.
Another collectable Star Wars item on my list.
I purchased for my new son n law. Big time Star Wars fan. I spent some time in their home and watched him pack his work lunch. He says they are perfect for the leftovers he takes to work. And no one gives him a hard time about the pictures. In fact co workers ask where he got them!
My best friend is a Pyrex queen and searches out rare finds. She is also a StarWars nerd to the hard core‚Ä¶. Needless to say my best friend fudging loved it!!!! She‚Äôs also low key the best forking baker I know!
Cute but small and can't be used in the oven
"I bought this obviously because it has Baby Yoda all over them, but also because of the Pyrex brand. I already knew these containers were going to be great. I use them all of the time, and I love having them."
Gave to my daughter who loves Star Wars.
Daughter in law wanted a Star Wars kitchen so this was a great present.
These are perfectly portion sizes for lunches. So much nicer and stays warm a lot longer than a plastic container once heated up. Love it!
"These are great! I was expecting smaller dishes to bring lunches to work, so the size is perfect. Cute!"
Perfect for the grogu fan
Who doesn‚Äôt love Pyrex? And then they add Star Wars to them... too blasted cute! I had to have them.
Got these for my son who is living on his own now. Thought this would be a more fun way to stock the kitchen up with needed items
"I love this set. It‚Äôs a little spendy, but it‚Äôs adorable and works great."
Pyrex is so sturdy and I like the black lid.
I was surprised on the sturdiness of this product. Definitely easy to clean and the design hasn't rubbed off or lost its color. I wish they were Slightly bigger but over all happy with this purchase
These are so adorable we‚Äôve always got my mom Yoda stuff so with baby Yoda coming out love being able to get stuff like this for her
My wife loves using them for her lunch.
Perfect gift for the star wars fan.
My sister loved these as a Christmas gift. Same great quality with a fun pattern.
"Bought as a wedding gift, couple loved them."
"As with most Amazon products the reviews were mixed. I took a shot, and at least on this instance it worked out for me. The oxygen absorbers are good (not expired). I'm also happy with the thickness of the mylar bags. I'm sure I will purchase again in the future. I would recommend purchasing some 100 cc oxygen absorbers as well so that you don't waste the 400 cc absorbers that come with the batch on small packages."
"Nice thick bags, OAs are in smaller packs which is great. Bags are just a hair thicker than harvest right bags, but similar quality. I ordered 3 different brands and these are by far my favorite. Just ordered another pack"
"First off, I love that it has a zip lock seal that aided in securing the product while heat sealing the mylar above that. I used them to store long grain rice, pasta and red beans. It was easy, put in product, add O2 pouch, close zip lock seal and then used a clothing iron to seal the mylar above the zip lock."
"If you want a heavy duty Mylar thick wall bag, This will meet you needs. You can heat seal top of bag & it also has a press lock reuseable plastic seal for reuse. Has three size bags. Smallest bags are abit small, But can be used for pills, tea bags, matches, small amounts of condamintes. Value is good. Oxygen absorbers are large enought for all bag use."
"I want to start off by saying that I have purchased 5 sets of these bags. Overall I think they are good quality, but they are not puncture resistant. I had pasta in a 1 gallon bag and rice in the quart bag. The corner of the rice bag punctured through the one gallon bag. Had that not occurred, I would give 5 stars. However, since my bag says puncture resistant on the back cover and they are clearly not, 4 stars it is."
"I love the variety of sizes, and the bags work well. For some reason, they aren't getting rid of the oxygen with the absorbers. I've even used 2 in smaller bags. I don't leave them out. I put them in a Ball jar as soon as they're opened. Finally, the 3rd bag I opened sealed the jar I was using to store them in. I'm new to this, so I'm open to the possibility that it's just me. I'm being extremely careful though."
Thick and very durable. Best made bags I‚Äôve ever used. Price is getting a little high but still worth it unless they keep going. Last purchase was $38.
"Great value for the cost. Great selection of bags. Son, daughter bought same package. Like the different sizes. Easy to seal. Keeps products good for years. Military uses similar products. Use oxygen packs. Also in rice, beans. Use Bay leaves."
These seen to be just great for what I need. I was impressed with the packaging they came in. Better that others I've gotten
I love these storage bags. They are high quality and the size variety included are very usable. The labels are very sticky.
The bags came as described with the labels to easily mark what was going in. They seem extremely sturdy and made it easy to put away a little back stock of the essentials. I would say you need larger bags for anything 2lbs or more.
"These mylar bags and oxygen absorbers are great! This is my second order; as most people, I'm using them for emergency food storage. I feel very confident using this product!"
Very sturdy and durable
"They fit more than they look to, the bottoms open up on them and they are thick. Very good quality. I will purchase again"
Great for prepping! Remember not to use oxygen absorber with sugar! üòÜ
"These are the real deal. I use the smallest bags for veggies/ fruits,mid size for freeze dried protein, large bag for rice or beans. Boom,whole meal prepared. Just add water. Will be buying more"
with #FJB food storage is becoming critical these bags preserve dry good for years .
These worked out great for our freeze drying efforts. The small bags are perfect for berries and fresh herbs.
"I am very pleased with price, quality and ease of reuse."
These bags were easy to fill and seal; the bottom expands like origami to a stable footing. The oxygen absorbers were conveniently packaged by 10 count; I opened only the absorbers I needed. The Mylar thickness was perfect for the size. I was able to package 50 pounds of wheat flour in a short time with high confidence in durability.
Like to have three sizes to choose from.
"There is tons of bags, enough oxygen absorbers, all great quality. I will be purchasing again when I run out"
was able to mylar bag all my barley and steel cut oats. this food will last 25-30 years (or more??) and may be a Godsend for someone other than me in the future.
These Mylar bags do not disappoint. High quality for the money sick work well
Great
This product is dope
Bags and oxygen absorbers worked as advertised
Very durable and seal easily with a flatiron.
"These bags are durable, easy to use. I like the bottom being able to stand up on there own. I am not sure how well the zip lock works on them, I heat sealed them also."
Bags are nice thickness and seems really good quality
"La verdad todo muy bien , es buena inversi√≥n"
Excellent quality - easy to use. Labels for use included.
"Setting up my long term storage, these bags and oxygen absorbers have worked well on the first 3 sets I have sealed."
Love how easy they are to use. everything included.
"works great and very simple to use, was pleasantly surprised it came with oxygen absorbers"
Absolutely love these Mylar bags.
Package a bag of beans. Everything seems to be going well.
Durability
Exactly as expected. Shipped quickly.
Can seat with a flat iron
I like the sturdiness of the product and the ease of use.
The products are perfect
"UPDATE: The seller took it upon thereselves to refund my money due to the bad oxygen absorbers. Much appreciated!  The bags are great, feel thick and they are resealable, however..... I had to cut open about a dozen of the packed mylar bags about 4 different times because the oxygen absorbers didn't do their jobs. (I left them sitting for a week each time before finally cutting them open to use a new absorber. Therefore, I ended up cutting off the resealable top because the bags got smaller and smaller. I had to throw away 3 oxygen absorber packs because they didn't get warm so I figured I wasn't going to waste anymore time. I'll just order a different brand. Waste of money üëé The photo of all the open absorbers are going into the trash as they never got warm, I've already thrown about this many in the trash when I tried to redo the bags!"
"I'm not sure if the OAs are bad or the bags are bad, but I filled 20 bags. Only 8 of them worked correctly. (see photo). All were bagged at exactly the same time, in the exact same way. I even put 2 OAs in the gallon bags because I wanted to make sure they sealed correctly as this is for long-term storage. As you can see, even with 2 OAs they did not remove the oxygen in the bags.  I re-bagged several of the ones that did not work. This time I put in 3 OAs in the gallon bags and 2 OAs in the quart bags. I got the same results. Of the ones I did, only a few worked correctly.  Very disappointed.  The last thing you want is to prepare for long-term storage, open the bags in a few years and realize your food supply is bad. What a waste that would be."
"The bags seem to be of good quality; however, it rather defeats the purpose when the absorbers are expired. They have them wrapped separately in counts of 10. I filled 10 bags with food, then at the last minute opened 3 ¬†packages of the absorbers (larger bags needed 3 each) then sealed bags with a hot iron. Checked the next day and only 2 quasi worked. So then I did the process over (wasting the bags was not easy) as they are quite pricey. Anyway, the absorbers failed again. Send an email to the company to send me absorbers that work, but no reply. Made sure to include a picture of the brand and bag. I would look elsewhere. In the future, I think I am going to purchase the bags and absorbers separately."
"Two main points: 1-Open it carefully or else there will be no zipper function. The zipper part will end up on only one side of the bag and you will not be able to close it. 2-Even if you do it correctly, you still run the risk of it opening. Don't know what would have caused it, but other than the bags that entirely lost the zipper function, other bags we used decided to open after having been properly sealed upon gentle handling.  Therefore, it would be a valid suggestion to heat seal the bags in addition to whatever other precautions are taken to ensure the longevity of the food because the zipper cannot be trusted."
"Update: the seller was quick to respond and processed a full refund.  Original review: I spent a week roasting, baking, cutting up and then freeze drying batches of fruit, quiches, and chicken. Packaged it all split between the few bags of a different brand that I had left, and these bags with these oxygen absorbers. Only a few days later, I went to eat a bag of the fruit slices. They‚Äôre damp. I tried some from the same batch that were put in the different brand of bag‚Äîthey‚Äôre totally fine, still freeze dried. I checked all the other bags of food, and everything in this brand of bag is ruined, about two dozen bags which is about 10 pounds of food ruined. The math makes me want to cry.  At first I thought it was the oxygen absorbers that were bad, so that‚Äôs what I initially complained to the seller about. After reading some of the reviews about the bags being full of holes I went and checked the bags. Yep. Hold them up to light and you can see little holes everywhere. Even the seams are so thin you can see light through them! The bags are completely worthless unless your stuff only needs to be stored in what‚Äôs essentially a mesh bag, which makes the oxygen absorbers pointless.  I‚Äôm awaiting a response from the seller. Seeing from other reviews people were given a refund so I‚Äôm hoping for that. I‚Äôll chalk the $$ for the ruined food (rip grocery budget!) up to a reminder to read the negative reviews and then double and triple check your products before you use them."
I needed to freeze dry my accumulated food in my freezer to clear up space.
"These bags have a ziplock closure at the top, but are unusable that way due to not being adhered properly. One side of the plastic zipper pulls away from the bag. I heat seal mine, but it would be nice if once opened you were able to zip it closed."
"The oxygen packs they sent didn‚Äôt work. Otherwise, great bags and yes, I used the absorbers immediately and heat sealed the bags."
What I ended let you know how they work
Great for long term food storage. Zippers help with sealing process by sealing bags prior to adding heat to mylar for final seal. Had a few quart bags with bad unattached zippers.
"I was looking for some Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers and was so excited to see both combined in one purchase, in addition some great little labels.  So I got to work, froze my food for a few days, let it dry out for a few days, and then start packaging it up in these ""100pcs Mylar Bags for Food Storage with Oxygen Absorbers 400cc"" In addition to using the ziplock seals I also sealed the bags with a hot iron. Went to sleep, woke up and only 2 of the 24 bags I completed the night before were oxygen free. Which now means I get to destroy 22 bags by opening them up, putting them into another Mylar bag, adding new O.A.s and crossing my fingers.  They are amazing Mylar bags, so if you are JUST looking for bags these are great, but if you were like me & needed O.A.s, I recommend going with another brand. Lots of money wasted now & glad I didn't put the food away without checking the oxygen levels first, as imagine that 10 years from now.  I tried to reach out to the manufacture SHXWELL however I am unable to find any contact info for them online.  SHXWELL, if you are reading this and would like me to correct my rating, please reach out to me."
I vacuum seal all of the bags to find out hours later air got in. I started looking at the other bags and each one had holes at the bottom of Each bag.  Update the company reached out to me and fixed things I must have gotten a bad batch
"One of my bags had a puncture hole, but other than the one damaged bag I‚Äôve been very pleased with the quality."
I been finding pin holes in some of the 5X7 bags and one seem broke on the gallon size bag as well. I never had these issues with bags before until I got these bags.
"Great customer service!! I was sad to find that the oxygen absorbers that came with the package did not work. Of course you don‚Äôt find that out until you have filled all the Mylar bags so you can‚Äôt return them. The kit is perfect, bags, labels, directions on how many cc‚Äôs oxygen absorbers to use. But, it was heart breaking that the packaging of the absorbers was not effect enough to keep them viable. Once they knew of my situation, they gave me a complete refund. It was fast and courteous."
So far so good.
"I liked everything, the product, the packaging and on time delivery"
"Mylar bags where awesome, but they came without the oxygen absorbers. That‚Äôs why I gave it a three stars. I expected to get the oxygen absorbers with the bags. üò≥"
Small bags too small
"Muy f√°ciles de usar, pr√°cticas y se sienten firmes y gruesas PERO LOS ABSORVENTES DE OXIGENO NO FUNCIONAN, PESIMOS!!!!! SIENTO QUE BOTE EL DINERO YA QUE LAS BOLSAS NO TIENEN MUCHO SENTIDO SI NO SE PUEDEN SELLAR AL VACIO  QUE DECEPCION"
Nearly all of my large bags had slits or holes in the gusset that forms the base of the bags!!!! The mylar seems too thin and the fold in the gusset appears to be the cause of the holes /cracks the Mylar. Glad I discovered this before I trusted my food storage to these bags. I didn't know to buy nothing thinner than 5 mL's thick- - until after I ordered these. Now I know why.
"I bagged up flour and rice, added the absorbers and sealed...and it appears the oxygen absorbers don't work. I tried again and had the same results. Complete waste of money."
"Did not like the fact 98% of the bags had pin holes and would not seal. I have wasted oxygen absorbers, my time and money. Don't waste yours people!!!"
Some bags leaked. Not all Oxygen Absorber pouches contained 10 units. Design doesn't favor heat sealing above ziplock. Not the product for serious food storage that you may need to survive.
"The bottom seem on EVERY BAG has tiny holes, making them useless!"
I really love these bags. They feel so thick vs this other brand I was using. They have zipper seals and These bags stand up!!!! Makes my life so much easier with filling and even sealing. Love they had different bag sizes to choose from. They also came with 100 oxygen absorbs. in lots of 10. Perfect for my needs since I like to work in small batches. Overall these are now my go to bags. They sealed great using hair iron. Out of 30-40 bags used so far.. I have not had ONE bad sealed bag yet. For me thats is saying a lot. Will be back to buy more soon.
I love this pack! Very impressed with the variety of bag sizes. I wasn't sure about moisture packs and this complete pack took out the guesswork! It even has waterproof lables! It is so tightly packaged and sealed well too. I have never used these bags before. I wanted them to seal up my dogs food. It gets bugs in to it. I figured if I make smaller packs it will solve the problem. I would Definitely purchase again when these run out. Now I'm looking for things to seal and not waste. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
I ordered the 100 pack of 3 sizes. The mylar bags were great. They were heavy and of excellent quality. The cost was reasonable. I would order these again. They came with oxygen absorbers that were no good though. Maybe they were old. I have no complaints about the quality of the bags. Hopefully next time I'll get good oxygen absorbers.
"Let me start by saying I do not like being deceived. These are advertised is airtight. Which they definitely are not they do snap down, the lids themselves are airtight, however the pop-up opening that you pour has no seal around it and the containers are absolutely not airtight. was going to send them back but I don't want to be bothered I just gave them to my son who can use them. Be truthful in your descriptions."
These containers are great. I wanted to organize my pantry and these made that task simple. I didn't want the hard plastic ones because I have tile flooring in my kitchen and have been known to drop things. They hold all of my staples as well as anything else. I like that the entire lid lifts right off for easy scooping out amounts of baking products. They look nice and the chalkboard labels make finding what you are looking for a breeze. The labels can be easily wiped and relabeled as needed. The smaller ones easily stack too.
"I have only had these for a few days, but so far, I really like them. I love how much more organized things look with these! The labels definitely help with the organized look! (I recommend putting the label on smoothly first, and then writing on it. This way you don‚Äôt have to worry about smearing the writing when smoothing out the label.)"
When the item arrived the containers appeared smaller that what was suggested in the pictures. The containers are packed inside each other and at first we thought we were missing pieces. We kept the containers and they are working well.
"Absolutely love these storage containers. They're smaller but exactly what I needed. I love how it fits, closes, and look in my pantry. I also use a few of them to store food and freeze. I will definitely be ordering again as I need more to make my pantry more organize. Maybe my only suggestion would be to make the long ones a big longer, but such options are out there available if anyone needs it. Love these!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Organized and opened up room n the kitchen with these. They are plastic and make airtight and well. Great packaging, durable and easy to label. Definitely recommend!"
They containers hold up great to my kids constantly dropping them and are much more cost effective than other brands.
I watched one too many organizing shows and bought these as they are well priced. Lightweight and lids are easy to put on. I ended up buying 3 sets and thinking of buying one more set.
The biggest isn't big enough for my big box of Cereals but it is great for snack cookies and chips. Keeps everything fresher longer. Keeps my counter organized. Would buy again!
I haven't had these long enough to know how they hold up but so far so good.
Love everything about it. Really leak proof and keep food fresh way longer ! Love it.
"I got this for a pantry remodel, for pasta, beans and baking supplies. They work perfectly for what I needed and the space I have."
I like the different sizes. The chalkboard is very convenient and this product is as described
""
I am buying more. I love these
Kitchen food storage. Hard to find large sets
I love the durability and airtight storage these containers provide.
"They're modular, air tight, and stacksble."
The packaging was really confusing bc they all looked the same size so I almost just returned. I did think they would be bigger so pay attention to the given measurements.
Great food storage container
Just perfect üëç
"My kids had a hard time figuring out how to properly open, pour and close cereal boxes. Apparently, my kitchen rocket science skills didn‚Äôt get passed down to them. So, I had to enlist a little help. These storage containers are a godsend! Not only does it make the entire process exponentially easier for them, but I can label them! Because, you know, it‚Äôs hard to tell the difference between Coco Puffs and Honey Nut Cheerios through CLEAR containers. These things are great! I suggest buying them if you have children who are cereal box ignorant. :)"
Great product! Helps organize the pantry and keeps the creepy crawlies out of our cereal!
I put everything from rice to cereal and even chips and cheetos. My only issue is I need to find room to put more of these in my house. I love them! No matter what I put in them it can be a month in and my cereal is still fresh or my chips are still crisp. It keeps any bugs out never had one issue with that. I also love the little cups that come with it they are amazing. I never used the stickers but I think its because I'm always changing some of the things that are in them so I figure I would be changing them too much. They are easy to wash and reuse. I love the color coordination as well so you can easily tell someone to grab a certain color if they can't tell whats in them.
"Great product! Wish they were a little bigger, then it would get 5 stars. I buy bulk sized cereal and I need 2 containers to hold one box. I ordered a silver Sharpie at the same time since another review said it didn't come with a marker, only labels. That worked great! These are nice and tight & keep our cereal fresh for a long time!"
"nice sized containers, sturdy, no chemical smell at all which was my biggest concern. i LOVE the labels and white ""chalk"" pen. great idea and very handy. measuring cups too. they are kind of scoop shaped which is nice. getting the lids on was a lil tricky at first but that's mostly user error. I got the hang of it after a couple run-thrus lol. oh, and be sure to put the lid on so that its spout end is on the opposite side of the grippy side of the container, cahpeesh? this would make a great gift for a wedding/baby shower or for your kid who's moved into his own place or is off at college"
"These containers are a nice size and I feel they will work well for crackers and other items in my cabinets. Each container comes with a scoop that matches its lid color, except I got a blue lid and an orange scoop and not sure what happened to this pink one? I scrubbed them by hand and whatever this mark is does NOT come off. Granted this does not affect the workmanship of the item, but it is brand new and should be the items shown, clean and free of flaws. See pics"
"I had a LOT of OLD ********** that was sticky and smelly and it ALL went in the garbage! These new storage containers are GREAT! They are BPA FREE so now I don‚Äôt worry about dangerous chemicals leaching into my food.  They are clear so I can see how much of something I have, but also have cute little labels and a pen to write on them. If you change what‚Äôs in them, just wipe label with a damp cloth.  The price was also nice. I bought TWO sets!!!"
Package sucks and it arrived broken  (Update 02/24/2022) Even thou one of the containers was broke this was the BEST purchase I made in a while (and I‚Äôm a shopaholic) they are a nice size my child 6&9 can now make cereal with out making a mess or not closing my bags(I HATED THAT) they have a Great seal to keep the things fresh they are not hard to store (not to close to one another cuz the tops are large) but over all a great buy would definitely buy again
"It‚Äôs nice and serves its purpose but the durability Not sure how long it will hold up but I‚Äôll handle it with care thinner than my other one‚Äôs I bought, I bought a large box of minute rice and was able to poor the whole box In container"
"Got my order today (8/10/20) and threw in dishwasher so I could start using them. When I went to take them out of dishwasher, they warped. I cant use them for their intended purpose. The box says dishwasher safe...?"
"One thing that bothered me was that it left crumbs and bits at the lip where you pour the cereal. Sometimes cereal would get stuck at the opening like Honey Bunches of Oats so you have to ""reset"" the container right side up but a cereal like Cheerios would pour easily. Quality of the container is nice and thick for airtight seal. Grip is shaped well for good hold. Haven't tried to erase names on the labels so unsure whether you can erase and the labels if you rotate cereals."
"The measurements are off. They do not account for the lid. This was important because I was expecting to fit 2 of these in a space that was 7 inches wide. However, since the lid is about 4.5 inches wide, I cannot fit these in. The length is also off - about 9.5 inches long."
"Cereal companies are using thinner cardboard in their boxes which collapses when grabbing them or trying to pour. I wanted something sturdy, easy to grip (not too wide for kids hands) and easy to pour. These fit the bill and they keep the cereal fresher longer. The clear container also makes it easier to see when we are running low on a particular cereal. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this purchase."
My favorite containers for cereal! I bought clips in the past for the cereal bags and my kids always had such a hard time putting them back on. So I Bought these containers and never looked back. They are easy open and close but still maintain an air tight seal. The labels and measuring cups were a huge bonus! I love those labels! Definitely recommend
"I can't rate durability because I've only just purchased the containers, but I like the size and feel of the containers. The pour spouts are a great feature and the lids snap on easily. I think if you squeeze the sides of the containers too hard when pouring, you might make the snap locks on the lids disengage, but otherwise, they seem secure."
"I‚Äôve been trying to give these containers a chance for a few months now but they keep disappointing me. i‚Äôve kept cereal, cookies and even my pets food in these containers and no matter what, it goes stale. within two days i‚Äôm throwing out whatever i put in them. can‚Äôt take it anymore, had to throw them out today."
"Its not the product's fault, but my kid accidentally pushed the container off the dining table. It cracked. Its my fault and I was hoping the containers would survive a few drops from a busy family. One down, three more containers to go."
The containers are designed with one side smaller than the other. It makes it so I cannot store them neatly. Also it may be hard to see in photo but if you want to use for liquid it is impossible to not spill. I was very disappointed
I Purchased these to store all kinds of food products after a problem with moths. The problem has since been resolved but I am keeping my food products in these containers from now on. It gives me a sense of security. Very happy with the size and quality
I love these containers they are very airtight and sturdy they hold the giant size box of cereal or either a regular box and a half.
"These are awesome! Perfect cereal containers! Comes with chalkboard labels, on which I just used some regular old chalk I had layin' 'round, idk if that's what I was supposed to use but it's working, so I'm happy! Locks tight, we will see in the weeks to come how my cereal maintains freshness... before now I just rolled the bag up inside the box and it was fine, but my pantry looks a lot neater with my cereal packed in these!"
Bought this set to help keep my counters in order. They are easy to use and so nice. I love them.
"Like: Size of the containers Labels and pen included, but I did not use them... Measuring cups, but I don't need them... Dislike: Wasn't sure about all of the snaps needed to close the containers, however...I got used to them; probably a much better seal!"
They‚Äôre so good that I bought a second one. I really like how good the material is that‚Äôs why I decided to buy a second one. I just received my second one. Thanks!
These things are nice. I use them for my cereal. Pours great. I can fit all the cereal from a family size box of cereal. Good purchase.
"I love these! I got these to organize my cereal cupboard with. They are very good quality, just the right size, attractive and design, and have really nice legs that are easy for people with arthritic hands to take on and off. I am very happy with my purchase and I will buy more of these"
"These are perfect! They hold more than a regular sized box of cereal (almost 1 and a half) and are a perfect fit for the shelf we wanted them on. And my daughter was excited that they were ""color coded"" for the 4 cereals we buy the most. The 4 colors match the colors on the boxes lol."
"This will be my 3rd time purchasing these (adding to, not replacing) and just a heads up they‚Äôve changed their lids. They now have a different design on the top spout portion. Still appears to be effective, my OCD just wasn‚Äôt expecting the different appearance (personal issue). I use these for tons of stuff, and while I wouldn‚Äôt attest to being super air tight, they get the job done, have a sleek design, and are easy for kiddos to use."
Amazing! This price is unbeatable and these are perfect. They have a snap-lock system for the lids to attach to the container part and it seals soundly at the opening on the lid. I'm going to buy four more for other things!
"Just what we needed for our new refrigerator! Saved us a lot of space, and easy to use."
The picture clearly shows 6 cans on the bottom row. These only hold 5 cans on the bottom row. This means in terms of capacity they are a full 25% smaller.
"This is another MUST HAVE ITEM!! I always wanted these soda can organizers for my garage refrigerator. I regret not buying them sooner!! What a space saver! You can actually stack the sodas much higher than the bin, provided your shelf has the height. The pyramid design of the cans prevents them from tumbling out. Great for my top shelf which is taller. They need to make these in a wider size, as well, for the longer hard seltzer cans!! The bins are made from a crystal clear hard plastic with no sharp edges. The tapered cut out plastic end allows one to easily grab the next can. There are no lids. The bottom of the trays have ridges, they can slide on the shelf but stay put when full. Rubber feet might have been nice but not necessary. This set comes with two identical bins which measure almost 14 inches long. The Amazon pic looks like one tray hold more cans and is bigger, it‚Äôs not. I think the Coca Cola cans pictured are the mini cans, not sure, as 5 standard cans fit in the bottom row. I love the organized look, I need to get more! Wish they came as a 4 pack!"
"This review is for the Atopov Set of 2 Refrigerator Organizer Bins Fridge Organizer Freezer Pantry Organization and Storage, Beverage, Canned Food Container Bin for Refrigerator (2). The Fridge Organizer is made of strong plastic, and is clear, the sodas fit well in the bin, and are easy to access. The Fridge Organizer uses gravity as you pull one can, another can come down. The bins are not dishwasher safe, so you only want to wash by hand and rinse off."
"First: this is a good product for soda can storage. We have an entire fridge in our garage with nothing but drinks, so organizers like these are great. No problems with quality, love 'em.  HOWEVER: the main product photo on this site shows a ""large"" and a ""smaller"" in this set of 2, The photo of the larger one (red soda cans) is shows it holding 6 cans on the bottom row. You do NOT get one with that capacity, this is a set of 2 of the smaller ones (green cans in the website photo), they hold just 5 cans on the bottom row.  You can see in my attached photo that you can ultimately get 12 cans stacked normally. That's a typical case of cans."
"These arrived earlier today and I'm already using them! I like how much simpler it is to find things in my fridge already. I always have too many jars and bottles to fit in the doors of the fridge so I like that I've been able to put all of those, from olives to jam, in 1, against the side wall of my fridge. Now I can easily see them without them getting pushed to the back or being in my way and while still having room for things that I want to be able to see and find easily beside this organizer on the same shelf. Overall, these are a winner for me!"
"I named this product this way not because it is the worst product I‚Äôve seen recently but more as a play on words, it is unfortunately as loser for me because it is too big. It actually has three different drawbacks that made me wonder what they were thinking of when they designed it. I‚Äôm at a loss to find a way I can use it that makes sense.  CONS  From their description I assumed it was meant to hold beverage cans in the fridge. At that task it simply doesn‚Äôt work. It only holds five cans, and by design it holds them laying on their side. Well if I take those cans and stand them upright I can fit a row of them of 7-8 from the back to the front on my refrigerator shelf. And they take up a horizontal space of three inches. But if I use this tray I can only store five cans and laying on their side they take up 5-1/2 inches of horizontal space, almost twice as much. I illustrated that by posting a photo of that with soup cans in my pantry to make it easier to see. And unlike most similar fridge beverage storage racks there isn‚Äôt a built-in slope so the next can rolls toward you. The final disadvantage is that they don‚Äôt stack. The picture they show on their page is misleading, it looks like they are on top of each other but they are actually photoshopped side by side with one positioned higher than the other and one tray is larger than you actually receive. No matter how you look at it this is a major drawback, almost all similar plastic storage bins stack. I illustrated that by showing how useful these would have been in doubling the available storage space on my refrigerator shelf, the one where the height is dictated by the height of milk cartons and large soda bottles. The rest of the shelf has regular pop cans that only take up a fraction of the available vertical space. If these stacked I could store twice as much.  PROS  No one says that these have to be used as beverage bins, and if I look at them simply as plastic storage trays they‚Äôre not bad, the plastic is strong enough to hold a reasonable amount of weight. But they would have been so much more useful if they stacked. And they also would have been handier if they had a better way to carry them, there is no handle so you are pretty much obligated to use two hands to carry one tray.  YES OR NO  I‚Äôm afraid to come to the conclusion that these are just ordinary plastic bins with no special benefits and some drawbacks that keep them from being as useful as they could have been. I can get such bins locally for about two bucks each. At their price of eight bucks per tray they are out of the question, and I am not all right with their misleading illustration. I would suggest keep looking for a better option."
One of the things I can‚Äôt stand is a messy refrigerator. These can holders have a done a good job of keeping our cold drinks organized. There is no assembly needed and loading them is very easy. I‚Äôve been very happy with how well these can holders have worked for us. It‚Äôs very easy to remove cans and reload them. The holders seem very sturdy so I think they will last for a long time.
Love these bins love that theyre transparent makes it easy for me to know how much of each type of can i have left without rummaging through the cardboards packs. Visually it looks cleaner and more organized. Theyre sturdy and also look great in the fridge. The bins hold about nine cans comfortably each.
"These are great quality! They are thick, durable plastic that is easy to clean. They slide right into my fridge and hold about a 12 pack of regular size soda cans. They keep everything organized and together, but without the ugly box that gets stuck to the fridge shelf."
"Our whole top shelf of the fridge was soda cans, diet for me and regular for my husband. They took up too much valuable real estate, so I used these to organize them. Now, there's room for more on the shelf and I can easily find my soda in the fridge without digging."
I got these to store my coconut water cans and they work great. These can be used in the fridge or the pantry for storing sodas or food cans. They are thick and good quality. I like the clear look better than cardboard boxes.
"Good, sturdy plastic and designed right. As you remove one can, the next drops into position. So much better than having them standing up in the fridge. I can recommend these."
These are fantastic for my seltzer cans. Very easy to use and the slim design doesn't take up too much space.
Work exactly how expected and save me a ton of space in my fridge. Love them.
"I ordered these with the idea of stacking them on my basement shelves to hold stored canned goods. Unfortunately they are not tall enough to be stacked nor are they designed to do so. They would need to be a bit taller or have some corner posts and an integrated bottom to be stackable. They hold 9 cans which is okay but that really only saves me about 2 cans worth of space as opposed to simply setting the cans on their bottom, and most cans are stackable by nature. If you have room to stack cans on top of each other this may not be a space saver at all!"
"Holds your sodas perfectly. For double stacking, you can have 5 cans at the bottom, and 4 at the top. One of the stock photos show 7 cans at the bottom, but I believe those are smaller thinner cans. It gets the job done, but we'll have to knock 2 stars for not being price competitive. A quick search on Amazon, and you'll find a set of FOUR for even less. This brand is a bit overpriced. 3-Stars."
"Pros: 1. Seem pretty well made and durable. 2. Holds a good many cans. 3. Easy to fill up. 4. Can pull out of fridge, fill and put back in.  Cons: 1. Does not slant enough to roll back cans forward. 2. Does not auto fill from the top like I really wanted but works ok."
"This will hold 9 cans of soda just fine in 2 layers. You can't really stack on a 3rd layer without it toppling. I like that the plastic is clear like glass. The thickness and rigidity of plastic is not great as there is a quite a bit of flex. If you only use it to store cans, it should be fine though."
Nothing special. Nothing that makes it stand out from other brands. But it does the job it is meant to do and that‚Äôs all I expected so I‚Äôm happy with it.
"Material is sturdy, easily holds a 12 pack with them stacked on top of the cans. I was hoping the 2 organizers would be stackable but they are not."
Great product
"This product is phenomenal. I had ordered this company's glassware and was impressed and saw that they now had plasticware. I ordered 2 sets one for my mom and another for me. The plasticware is bigger, durable, microwave, and dishwasher safe.i love them because you get 2 shapes rectangular and square. The product is light and pleasing to the eye. I use these for my lunch and storage . The containers are airtight like the glassware. The plasticware is still pleasing to the eye this will make a great gift set for college students, first apartments, people who love to meal prep and store meals."
Very Satisfied with the product nice to have the variety in the original purchase they make taking lunch to work easy & they definitely do not leak. I do however wish there was an option to order individual containers as I would like to have more of the 3 cup & 1.7 cup size but do not need the larger size. They are in my opinion the most convenient easy to use air tight container I have used so far.
"Love these containers! They appear to be of good quality, sized perfectly, easy to put on and take off lids and wash well. I prefer to wash them in warm soapy water by hand, because all plastics cleaned in the dishwasher become misshapen over time. These are too pretty to do that to!"
"Finally, a container that snaps shut easily. Cleans well in dishwasher and are leakproof. Worth the price."
"Highly recommend - This product not only looks good but works really well. They come in a very good selection of sizes (at least for my household). I've bought them for a client and for myself. Also, their customer service is great - they answered my request promptly, and they were friendly, polite and professional."
I love the many various sizes and the 2 shapes of these plastic containers. I also LOVE that they stack inside each other for 3 nice stacks which are so easy to store. The lids are air tight and it's so convenient that they are microwave and freezer safe. I would definitely recommend them to friends. Thank you!
The storage containers are good because the food taste fresh and the sides like it has a little problem fitting the top to the bottom but once you do get that done it‚Äôs very well put together
"Great quality with a low price, I use these for everything and take them to work with me! They have never spilled no matter what I put in them"
I've had the storage container with the snap tops before and these open/close so much easier than any other ive had!
Superior quality. Easy to clean. My only dissatisfaction is...I received 25% off coupon in product box and was difficult to redeem....had to install Messenger ..then only 1 product available for purchase +glass storage containers)... confusing ...
"This product came in varieties of sizes. I have some glass Tupperwares but they are heavy, so I buy this set for the occasions I have to take food to work. And this set is good value of quality."
Great tuppaware. Only drawback is the same drawback as ALL tuppaware. They grow legs when no-one is watching and one by one they wander off.......
They are awesome I just wish the smaller ones were slightly bigger but they‚Äôre airtight and a great new investment as lids always go missing somehow ü§£ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They clip on and stay on
These are awesome! The lids fit perfectly. We use these all of the time and now I'm thinking they'd even make a great gift. Definitely recommend.
Just received so have just begun using them So far great in dishwasher. Only negative is some difficulty snapping the lids on with arthritic fingers
"I ordered these containers once. Love them so much I ordered more Love that they work in the fridge, freezer and micro wave as well as the dishwasher. So far they are exactly what I needed."
The best. Some are hard to snap closed until you have used them a couple times.
"I was nervous about getting such a big set of plastic containers but honestly, these containers are great! The plastic is extremely high quality. The lids snap close nice and easy and the containers are air tight with no leaks. I also ran them through the dishwasher and they held up really well. 10 out of 10, would buy again."
"These containers are durable. The lids lock. So far, no issues."
Gave as a gift and they spoke very highly of the quality. Is the second time that I have given this to a friend.
"Love this set. Looks nice, easy to clean, & store. Highly recommended & would buy again."
"These are awesome! So many different sizes in the set, easy to clean, easy to see what‚Äôs in them."
These are great
"This product is perfect! I dropped one with soup in it, the container didn't brake and no mess to clean up."
"Using it for fridge, Freezer and microwave. Would buy again."
Great Tupperware for the price!
I am going to order another set
I love the easy to snap lids. And the containers are stackable inside each other.Now I have to try the glass ones because they say you can put them in the oven.
"I love the containers. They are of good quality. They are dishwasher safe and comes in multiple sizes. Overall, would recommend it."
"Love the storage containers. They are the right sizes, lids snap easily and are easy to clean."
I haven't had these very long but seem to be holding up well. The material is solid and the lids snap on tight. Dishwashing and microwaving hasn't affected them.
Go in dishwasher
"The more I use them, the more I like them."
Works great
Only us d couple so far seal great used micro and no problem
I love the variety of sizes and the fact that they seem to be leak proof. I'd buy them again.
I bought these as a gift for my mom. They are very good quality and she likes them. I would buy them again.
Love it air tight good sizes.
There were all the different sizes. And stackable inside each other.
Great leak proof and fit nicely inside one another for space saving
Well made Tupperware!! Happy with my purchase and highly recommend!!
Honestly really love them. They are a bit smaller tune I thought but thats on me for not looking at the measurements. Still love them though.
Very well made containers! And it‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre stackable
Love these containers!!!!
easy to microwave
"I liked the containers as I use them for storing cooked foods in the refrigerator and the containers do not retain any goody smell after washing them, very happy with my purchase."
is perfect
Keeps food fresh and are easy to clean. Tupperware microwaves well and keeps food fresh. Exactly what I needed!
Love the durability
Very good value.
Great quality product.
Sturdy and comes in multiple sizes. Good for a single person but not great storage if you‚Äôre gonna be saving family portions!
It works and good product
Great quality
I like the airtight and do not like that they are a little hard to put on lid.
"These containers are great! Good sizes, no stain, and easy to store. Well worth the money."
"Wonderful, easy to snap open and closed, great quality, perfect sizes, they all nest as 2 stacks- rectangle and squares, though not 100%as leakproof as I expected."
Very good quality and I love the sizes.
I like them They look strong
"Great product, lids fit and seal with out leaks, plus can use in microwave"
I like how they seal to perfection
I love them
I love how easy they are to store away. They are very cute and functional.
"Easy storage, nice having multiple sizes."
I loved great
Very useful and I like the seal that it has with the snap in lids
Love them! They are perfect
It‚Äôs a nice set. Many sizes. Easy to store and clean.
Great product and fast delivery!
"Great value, any size you need is provided."
"I like that these items stack and nest nicely, so I will keep the set. The sizes are useful to me. However, this is NOT WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE LISTING, and I am not the first reviewer to point this out, which is why I give it only 1 star. You will receive: 6 1/2 cup tiny containers good for nuts, dressing, etc. (Description is 5); 6 1 1/4 cup(Description is 5); 6 2-cup (Description is 5); 5 3-cup (Description is correct); 4 5-cup (Description is correct); 2 7-cup (Description is 3); 1 9-cup (Description is 2). There is NO 14 cup container as described in the listing. The containers themselves are as described, they seal nicely, stack and nest nicely. BUT KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT RECEIVING THE SET DESCRIBED and buy if you want more of the smaller sizes that I listed, and none of the largest size! 1 star for false description."
"I have a lot of these containers. I love them. But now it's hard to find the original tops without a steam vent. Some moron changed the design of the solid lids to incorporate a steam vent that can loosen, break, and is just a bad idea. Do you want a vent? Just crack open the old lid. Now I hunt down the old design on eBay because I won't be buying this design."
Beware only four large kids are vented!!! Pictures and descriptions are not accurate with regards to all size lids being vented. These take forever to dry whether washed by hands or in dishwasher. I would have passed on this set if I had known all the lids were not vented. This is deceptive advertising and amazon needs to rectify the picture showing all size lids are vented as well as the description. Other reviewers have noted similar misleading info on which lids are vented.
As a number of reviewers pointed out... This set consist primarily of small containers. By looking at the images I was under the impression that this set had a few large ones and 6 of the most common size that I use. Turns out the majority are only good for holding half a pack of m&m's. Beware.
"This is an example of over engineering &/or the common misconception that one has to make something new to make it better, which is obviously false. These containers were perfect without vent mechanism, now theyre worse. The mechanism housing the vent on the inside of the lid obviously takes space & it uses space inside the container to do so, which takes space from whatever one wants to store in the container - which is the purpose of the container & even more stupid is that venting could be done without the useless mechanism by partially opening the lid ya numpties. Not only that but the lids dont even snap together correctly anymore & probably because of that stupid vent switch. rubbermaid, get rid of the vent switch - its unneeded & a hindrance. Or at least sell the lids without the vent switch."
"I bought a set of these 6 years ago and they were great, held up well. They started getting a little stained and not look so nice after so much use. So I decided it was time to buy a fresh set. Upon receiving these I was greatly disappointed to see, like so many things, they have greatly lowered the quality. The clear bowels are about half the thickness of the old and the red lids seem to be a brittle plastic and not as rugged as the old. I can see these not lasting half as long as our old ones. I will keep using our old better quality ones and will be returning these half rate new ones."
"I purchased this set ages ago when I got sick of having plastic containers and thousands of lids. With only 3-4 lid sizes it makes things so much easier. Then on Prime Day I saw this set on sale which was the exact same set I previously had and loved but it had this new vent hole.  So I purchased them and I have to say the vent hole is really nice. I wouldn't microwave things in them before because I had bad experiences with previous products but I tried it with the vent hole and they work great! The containers are the same high-quality containers as before where they don't absorb colors or yellow with use.  The only oddity is the vent cover has some sort of snapping mechanism instead of being a flimsy flap. That's great but it adds more nooks and crannies to the lid and makes them a bit harder to clean.  I don't have or can't afford a dishwasher as much as I'd love one so it's difficult to wash these by hand really well. I have a tiny bottle brush I end up using most of the time. But overall these are great containers, they stack, and are compatible with the older lids and vice versa so I don't have any issues with them at all. 5-Star product! Go Rubbermaid!"
"I needed some replacements containers for a set I purchased last year. However, buying the containers one or more at a time was expensive. This set costs waaaaaaaaaay less. So, now I have extras of the containers I didn't need. The reason I needed replacements is I have retired some containers when they got damaged by the microwave. They are great and I always have a bunch of them in the freezer. They hold up well in the freezer. After a year I still have most of the set left. I find the 1.25 cup size are used most. However, there aren't any sizes that don't get used often. I use the 0.5 cup containers to make salad dressings, the 1.25 and 2 cup containers to freeze make ahead dinners. The 7 cup container is great for making pasta salads. When I bought this set, I threw away all those mismatched margarine, whip topping and other containers. Now my cupboard is neat and organized."
Picture is deceiving. Biggest container is much smaller that it looks. Disappointing. I‚Äôll be returning these. Need big containers as well as small ones. This won‚Äôt do.
"I was looking for good storage containers with various sizes so I can use them for storing my homemade baby foods, yoghurt, left-overs and as a lunchbox for my husband. This ticked all the boxes for me and such good value too.  Here are things I like: -item arrived nicely boxed and stacked (See photo - no strong smell of plastic. -material feels sturdy and lids close and seal pretty well. I like the sound it makes when it seals. -the containers come in varying sizes - some reviews mentioned they are too small but for what i need, these are perfect. I stacked them up against a small enfamil can (12.5oz) and you can get an idea of the size.  -great for baby food storage - The smallest containers are perfect for storing baby food, i even made yoghurt in a few of them and turned out perfect this morning. I packed my husband‚Äôs lunch in one of the larger ones.  -Just note that only the 4 large lids are vented. I am okay with that. -great value - you get many containers in varying sizes at such a good price.  Overall, i am happy with my purchase. I highly recommend it!"
"I've been trying to find the perfect container for years and these are the best so far! They seal tight, stack, and wash up nicely."
"These food containers are awesome! The price was so affordable, the fridge is now better organized, and the quality is very good. I love the vented tops you can use to microwave food, and my favorite soups, quickly and easily. I find that there is less use for the mini containers, so I would've liked another couple larger ones instead. But overall, the material is very durable and they're totally leakproof! They keep food, especially fruit and veggies, fresher for longer.  My mom has trouble opening things with her hands but doesn't struggle with these. So these should be appropriate for most seniors with weaker grips. This is a great set with an excellent value, and I would highly recommend it!"
"Easy stack, fairly easy open, tight sealing, .. Things are good except it is not a microwave safe. And dont put hot food on it. The plastic melts in microwave or in contact with hot food. I did no run microwave like crazy long either. It was a minute long. It is not food stain."
"Bought these containers to replace our old Rubbermaid containers of the same size. I did see a few reviews showing melted containers but I needed new ones and I liked the look of the new lids.  The lids work well. and I do like them.  The containers hold up to cleaning on the top rack of the dishwasher but they do spot and look really ugly!  The worst thing is that the containers MELT IN THE MICROWAVE!!! So, don't put them in the microwave.  The picture is what our container looked like after my husband reheated some ground turkey that was in the fridge. I washed it in the dishwasher and this is the result.  TERRIBLE PRODUCT! SHAME ON RUBBERMAID!"
Order was to have contained four 3 cup containers with lids and four 5 cup containers with lids. Only received four 5 cup containers with lids. instructions say to contact Rubbermaid for missing or damaged parts. Called Rubbermaid and the process to receive the items I paid for but were not delivered is maddeningly time consuming and this was not my fault.
"I use rubbermaid storage containers almost exclusively. They are moderately priced, sturdy, seal well, and have only a few lid sizes for multiple volumes of storage. I do not however like the vented lids because I never reheat with plastic in the microwave, and it is too easy to accidentally open the vent due to placement. Also I prefer the standard red (or pink, purple, etc) solid color lids over the gray and clear tops. The gray do not snap onto the other lids which makes storage a little less convenient."
Nice to be able to just get these two sizes. The multi packs come with some many other sizes I already have so many of.
"I like rubbermaid, been using for many many years. These seem to become brittle after using in a dishwasher, BUT they do last. I started to hand wash these because the edges would snap off with weight inside after the dishwasher (might be the heated dry) and sitting in the cupboard for a couple days. The ones that no longer have the seal from the edges being brittle are being used for dog dishes (thats right, theyre not ready to be thrown out) but the rest of them work great for keeping food hot, or cold, for picnics or food delivering to family and friends. The vents, my favorite addition to rubbermaid, make for splatter-free microwaving like spaghetti or meats. So far they haven't stained like my older ones but with time that might change. They insulate well, keeping stuffing hot and deviled eggs cold on a 45 minute drive to a family dinner. When you snap them together, they become one so be careful as they might tip over. But that doesnt matter, nothing is going to spill unless theyre thrown out a window or dropped from a distance."
"i ordered 2 sets & they were received on time, accurate, complete and undamaged & i'm very happy! i got these to replace/update a clear & red lid set. #1 i love the brand, and #2 i really love this new gray color. (didn't get them for the anti microbial feature, but we'll see if it does anything.) they need to make larger containers & make the bigger bowls for sale separately so people can expand their collection. there are def too many tiny ones, but i knew that going in. i expect them to last and perform like my original set, but if they fail i will definitely update this review."
"I've loved these containers for years and years. Every so often they go on sale on Amazon and I buy another 20+ pack, as inevitably over time I'll have to toss one here and there as it was in the microwave too long and got permanently discolored or a lid would melt because my wife forgot to take the lid off before microwaving or simply because I brought food to a pot luck and knew I would never have my food container returned. Ever.  I was thoroughly happy to see the new vented lids. These, while it requires a few extra seconds of cleaning (and I often pop the vent part off and clean it separately just to be sure I got all the nooks and crannies), are tremendous for venting while reheating food in the microwave. I haven't seen a single melted lid yet, provided we remember to vent the cover before heating something up. It also makes melting butter in the microwave super easy and no more worry about going a few seconds too long and having a dish filled with butter explode all over the inside of your microwave. Instead, almost no butter gets out the vent hole, and keeps it contained if you decide to step away for just one moment too long.  Grab them when they're on sale, and you can thank me later!"
Nice sturdy containers and like the vented lid. Lids also interchangable with other sizes. I have several of these and they have lasted a few years and are like new.  One big problem I have had is not receiving what I ordered. I received four 5 Cup containers with lids. The product description said four 5 cup containers + four 3 cup containers with lids. It specified 8 pieces -- only got half the order. Working on fixing it with Amazon.....
"The Quality, Presentation, if your storing your food in these containers.. their leak proof & sturdy. there's a corner on the lids where you can lift to give you easy access to open. In the middle of the lid there is a piece that you can pop up to release some heat its Ventilation when done you just snap it back down. I choosed Red it's my theme in my kitchen & favorite color. dish washer safe store in the freezer microwave Rubber made is an excellent brand for keeping your food fresh its cleaning is easy and been around for years. Nicely packed it's a nice set. I'm very happy with my order."
"These are the same containers I always use, but to get them, WITH the vented lids, at essentially $2/each was a GREAT value! I was glad to pick them up when I saw the deal. I've used these containers for over 10 years now and really like the quality. The only failure I have with them is dropping them when frozen, of course they'll crack then. SO much better than using cheap quality storage that has to be replaced annually - I still have some that are from the original box I bought - 10 years ago. It's the way to go!"
"A few of the medium sized bowls have lids with vents. I use these to reheat in the microwave and they do an awesome job! No accidental messs in the microwave. All the bowl lids all snap firmly and have a corner tab to make it easier for my arthritic hands to open them, hot or cold. I also use them in the freezer. I let the bowl sit at least 5 minutes before removing the lid as the freezer seems to make the edges a little brittle. When I tried to open from a side and not the tab I have broken a chunck of the part that sticks out. The bowl and it's seal ability remain in tact when this happens. Tomato sauce over heated in the bowl will begin to ""melt"" the sides and leave a rough texture inside, but this doesn't cause trouble using the bowl again. I got rid of almost all my other bowls. I used to think Rubbermaid was expensive, but you get what you pay for here."
"We are always losing lids to our plastic containers or else they leak or are very hard to clean, especially oil based dressings. These containers are beyond perfect. Even with liquids, you can toss these around, throw them upside down and they won‚Äôt leak a bit. The lids are very secure and these are overall heavy duty containers. They are easy to clean and I‚Äôve had no issues throwing them in our dishwasher. Would definitely recommend. After all the years of having plastic containers that are hard to clean, lose their shape and leak, it‚Äôs better to spend a little extra money and buy a good brand. Long term it‚Äôll be worth it."
"I used to use this a long time ago and still have those pieces but they were large and I ended up giving many smaller pieces away with leftovers. After that I tried glass containers but most of them shipped and I was very careful when I loaded them in the dishwasher so I don‚Äôt know when that happened. So now I am back to these and I love them. The plastic is very sturdy and see-through I just stored tomato sauce in them without any residue smell or stain. They‚Äôre lightweight, compact the lids are easily storable/stackable, they don‚Äôt slip and slide they take very little room it all fits really well in my Tupperware drawer I‚Äôm delighted and this is a great price"
"We have used Rubbermaid containers for a long time and some were getting pretty scraped up and even melted from using in the microwave. I know, not a great idea but when you are hungry and the leftovers beckon....  In any case, these new containers are great. I really like that the lids of each size attach to each other so they can be stacked. Plus the new larger lids have a ""burp"" or vent feature that looks like a handy upgrade for freezer foods.  This gave me the opportunity to toss out many of the older containers and the old rubber lids that were hard to clean. A trip through the dishwasher and these were good to go. You won't be disappointed with these for sure."
"I'm in my 60s. I've been using plastic storage bowls since tupperware was a thing. These are without exception the best designed, most user-friendly, easy-to-use and clean storage containers we've owned. I will not ever buy another kind unless they stop making these. They stack perfectly in storage and in the fridge, the lids stick together but are easy to separate, the lids are stiff enough for use, but pliable enough to go on and off and be 'burped' easily--AND they recently improved the mid-size lids with airtight vents that can be easily removed for washing, etc. As for cleaning, of course they look used after a year or so, but they stay evenly clear, they clean very easily (dish soap and water, no hard scrubbing needed ever), and even tomato sauce doesn't stain them if not left in there for more than a few days. We microwave foods in them, but not things that might stain them, so I can't speak to what cooking tomato sauce or chili might do to them, but in every other way, I have found these to be excellent for kitchen, garage, and general storage use--even the small ones. BTW, a sharpie will mark the lids without problem."
"These containers stand up to our constant use. We use them for leftovers, school lunches and snacks, and even to house various worms and roaches we buy to feed our bearded dragon ( we leave the vent open for air). Also, and I have zero evidence to back this up, but I swear these vented tops are more flexible and nicer than non-vented tops. These containers keep looking brand new even after hundreds of washes in the dishwasher, acidic things like tomatoes, etc. Also my kids haven't destroyed one yet in their backpacks :)."
"I've used Rubbermaid for decades because of the durablility, dependability, and quality of their products. Also, I had the occasion to deal with their customer service. They were top notch, so I'm a fan forever. These food storage containers take a beating at my house. We use them for storage and microwaving. We take them to school and work. Even after washing them in the dishwasher, they still hold up well. They can stain if you microwave something like tomato sauce, though. It's not a deal breaker, though, as I'm happy with the product and the company."
"I was looking for the previous style that I had purchased, but could not find anymore. I wasn't sure if I wanted ""vented"", but bought them anyway. These Rubbermaid containers are the same great quality as my other good Rubbermaid ones. The venting is really an excellent feature! I put the lid on with the vent open, push down to get out excess air and then close the vent. The added suction helps the seal. When I go to open, I open vent first and then pull off the lid. The sizes are perfect. The lids are all the same size and snap together so you don't end up with missing lids and they neatly stay together. Very happy with this purchase!"
"These are great! The variety of sizes is excellent (though admittedly, I seldom have need for the smallest ones, it's still nice to know they're on hand). The lids form a tight seal that seems essentially leak-proof (though I still don't have the courage to put them in the fridge sideways) and the containers themselves seem sturdy and durable. I particularly like the vented lids for some of the sizes. Though these lids are not nearly as leak resistant as the others, I've found that feature great for microwaving."
"These have only leaked on me twice. Once when I filled the medium one with water and shook it, and once when I filled the big one with sugar and opened the vent so I could press the air out and sugar went flying. I feel like both of those are on me though. Very easy to clean. Doesn't stain. Durable, I have put one of these through the ringer and its still working great. The vents are great when you don't over fill them. I have a very easy time pouring straight out of these, the lip can cause dribble but it doesn't flow back to the container and spill everywhere like a coffee mug, so I like them. Top shelf in dishwasher and you're golden. 5/5 would recommend."
"I use these to store all kinds of food in the cupboard, refrigerator and freezer. My original set has lasted more than 10 years and it is finally beginning to look a little scratched -- from lots of hard use in my kitchen.  I have tried several other kinds of storage containers but none last as long or as versatile and indestructible. I even have a few in the basement and garage for organizing screws and other random small parts.  Right sizes for most anything from Costco size bags of sugar and oatmeal to spices and seasonings.  I always wash them in the dishwasher with no problem and unlike others I've used, they ... just ... don't ... break.  And finally ... they stack securely and because they're square, they take up less space than round containers."
"I love these . The lids for the three middle sizes are interchangeable, and snap to the bottom of the bowls. They stack inside each other making storage super convenient. All of these containers take up part of one shelf in my cupboard, where the previous set I had took three. I wash them in the top rack of my dishwasher and they come out nice and clean with no warping or pitting. You have to be careful in the microwave, however. I don't think the microwave itself is the problem, but if the food gets too hot, it can damage the plastic. The vents in some of the lids are a plus though."
I‚Äôm super impressed with the durability & how well the lid fits so snug on the container. The vent & the snug fitting lid is a must for anyone who hates cleaning the big mess in the microwave when the lid pops off after microwaving 1 sec longer then you should have. I bought this set quite a few months back & use them regularly. There‚Äôs still times when I overheat the food but because of the vent on the lid I don‚Äôt have to spend my time next to the microwave opening & closing the door to let the air out of the container to prevent the big mess I know I‚Äôm going to have to clean if the lid pops off. I‚Äôm really glad I bought this set & would recommend it to anyone that has a tendency of over nuking their food.
"Can't attest to durability or if they are leak proof over-time, but I can tell you that so far they do not leak and I guess time will tell of their durability. They do as advertised and are exactly what I needed and why I bought them. Good quality, good variety of sizes at a reasonable and fair price. They organize, store and hold all my ingredients (which I prep each Sunday night for the week) needed for my daily morning fruit and veg. smoothie. And that's why, in my opinion since this is my review, the 5 stars."
"We bought these to replace our Tupperware set we've had for years. These store better and have vented tops so you can microwave in them. The seals are a bit hard to push down, but I assume they will probably loosen up after being used for a while. An added bonus is that when you have food in them they stack nicely in the refrigerator, with the base of one fitting into the lid of the other."
"I really like these vented lid containers. They're great quality, can go through the dishwasher and don't stain as easily as others do. I love the vented lid, you can fill it with hot food and put the lid on and open the vent to let it cool down. They're great for the microwave because you can just open the vent instead of remove the cover. I wish you could buy them in individual sizes as opposed to packages with a mix of sizes and wish they were more affordable but definitely a great product."
"This set gave me plenty of storage for all the meals I cook for which I usually have leftovers. The containers have snap-on lids (with the larger ones have a venting feature on the lid). The lids and the containers are totally stackable. They can go in the freezer for long-term storage. With the n=venting feature on the larger containers, they can also be put into a microwave to rehear the contents. So far they have stood up to freezing, microwave reheating, and the hottest water for washing. They are also made from a plastic that does not leach undesired chemicals into the food nor does it get ""stained"" by the contents--not even spaghetti sauce! Highly recommended choice if you need more food storage."
"From the smallest container (which holds a whole lemon üçã minus the ends) to the largest this set impresses  I wanted something for lunches as well as for leftovers I ended up purchasing 2 sets The lids are thick the larger also having a couple that vent for reheating in the microwave They are freezer, dishwasher and microwave safe They seal tight with no leakage (tested in lunch bags and on construction sites lol) From yougart and dressings to steak and rice leftovers there is a size for it"
These are great containers to bring food to work in. The vent lid makes reheating really easily the only downside is the bowls stain easily. Doesn‚Äôt matter if its red sauces or a brown gravy it takes the color and its almost impossible to get the stain out. It does fade over time. That is why I gave it 3 stars. I have a set that didnt stain however after many years the lids became flimsy and needed to be replaced. I wish rubbermaid would go back to the older style bowls that didnt stain.
"This pack is great. We ended up purchasing it twice and then our friends got it too after seeing the containers in our kitchen, so the product markets itself very well. I like several features of it, but especially the fact that they stack together and hold one to another so they don't slip by accident when the stack is moved. The only downside is that they are not 100% leakproof. If I create a vacuum inside by pressing the lid down with the air cap open, then close the cap, I can hear how air is pulled inside because of the vacuum. This however is far from a deal breaker. I highly recommend this product."
"I ordered a set that of these that I really enjoyed. They didn't have the vent on them. I don't know how well the vent would keep in sauces or broths if sent in a lunch, covered dish, or picnic situation. But they were as close to a previous order I made that I could get. I think the vents would be great for cooking in a microwave where you had to let some of the pressure out of the container. So I'm sure that feature will be fine though I haven't used it yet. I've been able to use the solid plastic lids when needed. So I'm pretty happy with that. I couldn't answer as to whether or not the vents would leak, but I'm guessing that they might."
"I wish they had a set with just the larger sizes without overpricing them. I can order this 60 piece set for $25, but 7c singles are $5. It's really no big deal, but it seems strange that there isn't a set of these like 4 for $10 or something if they're giving me 60 containers for $25.  Anyway, as you can see, I have to split hairs to find anything wrong with these, so you know they're good to go.  Oh, and a word of caution: as these are EXTREMELY air tight, if you put coffee in them like I do with one of mine, then be sure to open the vent BEFORE closing the lid and then you can close the vent. Not doing that with a full container of coffee and trying to release the air after through the vent when the lid is on, will create a jet of coffee grounds all over your kitchen. Quite messy. Anyway, I'm glad they're air tight, as I store meat in some of them."
Bought these to replace an old set I got from my mother. I may have gone overboard.  Pros: Stack and nest great. Lids fit together and are interchangeable with different-sized containers. stacking filled containers with same-sized lids is nice because the bottoms lock into the tops. Even the tiny ones hold a surprising amount.  Con: Lids can be a little tight to close. Containers will stain with tomato sauce - perhaps they should be made tomato colored like the lids?
"My pet peeve used to be different size containers with different lids.  This set is high quality with thick plastic bases and lids. I think it reflects the high standards of Rubbermaid who generally makes good stuff.  And best of all, the bases and lids match are mostly interchangeable. For example, medium lids fit the various medium bases, large lids fit the various large bases, and same with the small sizes. The kit has a nice selection of small to large bases. Totally recommend."
My plastic container cabinet has always been a disaster! So many lids and containers of different sizes and shapes. I can never find the correct lid and it is just a mess. This is my second time ordering the Rubbermaid containers. I do not lose the lids and have no trouble finding a container now. You can microwave in these and they are also dishwasher safe. They are easy to clean and durable. They stack up to save space. I can finally rid my cupboard of all the clutter.
"I‚Äôve been a fan of Rubbermaid food storage containers for several years. They‚Äôre more rugged than the deli containers that often get reused, they stack efficiently for storage, and the container bottoms and lids snap together in way that makes it easy to stack them in the fridge of when traveling. I was a little concerned at reports of them melting in the microwave, but mine appear to be the same resin that they‚Äôve always used. The pop-up steam vent looks like a useful thing, but I generally don‚Äôt heat food in these containers."
"Happy with whole set. Have been using them for about a year now and they have stood up to everything. Had no leaks, even when I dropped a big one of warm soup! Very impressive. Like the way the lids hang together and everything makes a compact unit in my small kitchen's limited space."
"I bought a set over a decade ago and they lasted me great, most to this day. Some have been marked by high temp microwaving chili and stuff, but other than my abuse, which it defied heroically, they're still strong as day one. This set seems the same, except these lids have a vent cap thing. Love it, highly recommend it. Dont buy cheapies or generics."
"I know glass storage containers are probably ""better"" but these are relatively inexpensive, easy to find when I need more, and decent quality. I like having only one ""set"" of storage containers so that they all stack and I'm not searching for the right lid. I bought a similar set a few years ago and bought this to replace lost/broken pieces and just overall have more pieces."
"i tossed all of my plastic storage containers into the recycling bin. no more. these rubbermaid containers and lids, that all match up to one another, and fit perfectly, just made my life so much happier. that stress of pulling seven containers and fifteen lids, that aren‚Äôt friends, IS GONE. so easy. i bought a set for both of my kids, and i intend on gifting the heck out of this product. I LOVE THESE! little things mean a lot. do it..."
"I wanted Tupperware because I know they last forever, I remember my grandmother having whole sets that she had 25 years later and I wanted something that would last, the last couple sets I purchased did not make it 6 months. Anyhow, the pricing for Tupperware is way above my budget so I went looking for something comparable. I read many reviews and these looked to be the most promising. I am very happy with them, very sturdy and the sizes are perfect for me. I will likely by a second set. Rubbermaid products are just as good IMO and much less money. I will try and remember to update after a year of use."
I'm buying some new ones to replace two sets I purchased ten years ago. In ten years I've microwaved and frozen everything under the sun in these. They finally started to look sad after nuking too many foods with high grease or sugar because it eventually scars or stains them. I'll probably be back out here in another ten too.
"Rubbermaid has been around for many years. We have used some of the specific containers for so ling that they literally wore out. The only commercially available versions were in sets of 30 or 40 that we did not need. Thanks to Amazon, we were able to order the specific pieces at a fraction of the cost! Thanks, Rubbermaid, for making the best products, but thanks, Amazon by giving us access to just what we needed!"
"Initially, out of the box, these are great, leak-proof, highly durable, and top-shelf dishwasher safe for me. The drawbacks are that they do stain. I make a lot of pasta and the colored sauces and the stain from the sauces retain embedded within the materials. Cleans OK, but the stain remains. I use these for storage of food in the fridge and for my work lunches, so they get use a lot. With age, they do leak more and more and discolor, so I buy a set every year to replace the old ones. Microwave safe is a plus."
"Good re-up or starter pack. I don't use the vented lids, find it hard to clean. Watch what you are doing when using the microwave. Learn how to set the power level to reheat foods more evenly. Do NOT let greasy foods boil in the microwave. Do NOT heat tomatoe based products in these or the color seems to set and you get etching from boiling. If you find this hard, switch to glass storage containers. Soap, bleach, and water soaks get the color out. Dishwasher safe for us at least. It's nice to have a single style of food storage container. Keeps the cupboard organized."
"Great product, does its job. The microwaveable feature is a little overrated. I think it's better to remove the lid when microwaving food. The vent works best when I'm storing leftovers that are still warm, gets all the extra steam out so the water after its cooled doesn't sit in the food. Not all of the lids have the vent, obviously not the condiment size containers but also the large one. Still love and would still buy again!"
"These are nice quality plastic storage containers, but where they shine is the stacking and locking lids that have kept the same form factor over the years. I bought this set to replace some pieces from older sets and everything still stacks and locks. before this system my cabinet was a train wreck of random containers. These are the best for cabinet organization!"
These are fantastic and $20 is a good price for this set.  My only issue is some times the plastic seems to melt and I've thrown 2 away (2 out of several sets over the past 8 months).  We use these for school lunches that we prep at the beginning of the week.  Early appreciate not having to dig for lids all the time. I snap the containers together on the fridge when meal prepping too.
I‚Äôve used a lot of Tupperware and this brand never lets me down. They are leak proof. Very easy to clean. And the durability on them is amazing. This is the only brand I use. And what makes it better is I got everything and right amount of containers and lids as said in the description. These are definitely worth getting.
"I needed to replace some old, mismatched containers and these are great basics! Love how sturdy they are and the overall look of them. I choose the black set and like that they‚Äôre not the same old red I had before. However, next time I would opt for clear containers for practical purposes."
I've only had these about a week but my old ones needed replaced badly. These came neatly packaged. The larger ones have the great vents!!! My son goes to work carrying several with him for his lunches and they are very durable. He works in a factory. They don't leak his food and the machine smells/particlesof the shop don't get into his lunch. They fit nicely in the top rack of the dishwasher too. Great upgrade from my last rubbermaid set!
These are the best food storage around. The vented ports help with warming up your food in the microwave. Empty containers can be stacked on top of each other to minimize how much space they take. The price point is cheap.  I don't understand the negative reviews. Rubbermaid is better than anything else.
I much prefer this variety set over other rubbermaid sets I've gotten in the past. I cook a lot at home and typically need more large container options so it works great for me. While the xs sauce cups are convenient when you need them I have found I would do just fine if only 2 came in a set and instead had more large containers.
"The lids are super durable and thick, not the slim flimsy plastic like most.  The vent lids (4 of them, because some people are too illiterate to use the internet) work perfectly and exactly as advertised.  Ill clarify again, this comes with 4 vent lids. Thats all it is supposed to come with, all that is described, and all that is pictured. If you ordered it, got 4, and are mad you only got 4, you more than likely push a door labeled pull."
"Oh how I love these...got so sick of cracked Gladware lids...mismatched containers...aweful...now thanks to this awesome set, I reorganized everything and got rid of all but a few of my Gladware...These stack great and the lids are interchangeable, so you are not digging through lids to find the right one! Genius...Thank you...Christmas present to myself...I will now have more time to do the things I love!!"
"I use these for pre-cut ingredients for salads I eat each day for lunch. Separate containers for tomatoes, peppers, onions, etc. The seal valve, on top, allows you to close the top and then vent extra air to make a pretty tight seal. No pepper or onion smell leaks out. I'm pleased with both sizes."
"We absolutely love these! We originally bought the set with smaller sizes as well (which we still use), but this is the size we use the most, so bought some extras. These have the vents which are fine, but not a necessity for me."
