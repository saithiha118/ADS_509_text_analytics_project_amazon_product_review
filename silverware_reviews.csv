"This set is very basic, which is what I wanted. Exactly as described. I read reviews saying the steak knives rusted after one wash so I was worried. I have washed them numerous times and there is absolutely no sign of rust. Happy with my purchase!"
My wife and I were surprised by the quality of this set The price we paid for this set is fair and worth the money. We bought these for our camper.
"I need more flatware and saw these and thought, why not for the price. I love them, sturdy, stylish and for what I paid a huge steal. They are now my daily flatware."
Very nice set of stainless steel.
"Can not beat this set for the price! The size/proportions are perfect, they have a nice smooth finish and they are well made. I've bought a similar price set at Walmart before that didn't even come with steak knives and it was junk so I didn't have the highest expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these actually are, especially the steak knives."
Just the right size flatware for a wonderful thanksgiving meal. My grandchildren didn‚Äôt have a problem with them and my fingers can hold them well with my arthritis.
I love this silverware set. It‚Äôs extremely shiny and I love having an extra amount of forks. The knives are very sharp. I‚Äôve washed them multiple times and haven‚Äôt seen any rust (mentioned in other reviews). It‚Äôs perfect for a new home.
"You can NOT go wrong buying this silverware!! It is SO worth the money. Usually it's true that you get what you pay for, but I am telling you, this set is worth EVERY penny spent!!"
The silverware is solid and of good quality! Very good value. Buy today!
"This silverware set is immaculate. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre medium weighted, good length and just overall great. Those steak knives are SHARP. I opened a pack of hotdogs like I was slicing through water. I don‚Äôt think one would be disappointed buying this set."
"These are attractive, smooth, sturdy, and has some weight to them. Totally worth the price."
Overall just as expected. Good quality silverware at a decent price point. Recommend.
"Just moved to a new home and this silverware set was better that I anticipated. They are very sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, and just what my new kitchen needed to complete ‚Äúthe look‚Äù I was going for."
Super fast shipping! Great product with all the pieces that I need for when my daughter moves out on her own.
The silverware are thick enough to use and ware well.
Ordered it for my camper great sec great price .
Great set for the price!
Amazing! Just as described! Great quality for the price. I will probably order another set or two to use at work sites!
"This is an awesome set, for the money even better."
very good price good reviews
"Excellent product for the money! Strong, sturdy silverware perfect for starting a home with."
Very good value and quality for the money
Such a great value for the price. All of the silverware has helped significantly with cooking and place setting.
Nice simple very happy
Great product for the dollar anount
"Looks luxurious! Husband wouldn‚Äôt believe the price, that‚Äôs how you know it was a good purchase."
Just what we needed. Fantastic.!!!
"Very nice set of silverware. It has a good weight, nice polish and easy to clean."
Much better than I had anticipated. heavier and the steak knifes will cut anything...so far :) I would recommend for anyone
Better than I expected! Especially for the price! Sturdy and strong silverware. Would order again.

The silverware was great and reasonable.
Very good
Like
Exactly what I ordered
This was a great value. Very happy with this purchase. Super fast shipping as well.
This is a great set but be careful with the steak knives...they are extremely sharp. Great for cutting but dangerous when hand washing.. accidentally cut myself ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ.
Everything is great except for the knives. The knives are just trash. Don't even bother
Not the best quality of steel. Useful if you don‚Äôt have anything else but not good for a fancy or formal dinner.
Sturdy and strong. You get a great product for your money
It‚Äôs sturdy silverware but does have some sharp edges on the spoons and stuff. I noticed that a few of them started to get rust spots when I let them dry naturally. I don‚Äôt have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash everything. We do have well water with a water softener system but the other silverware in the house didn‚Äôt rust. Overall it‚Äôs not a terrible deal for what it is. I would buy it again if in a pinch.
The silverware fits my needs
The box was busted open silverware was scratched. Very disappointed.in this order. Make it right..m
These are perfect for my home... They don't bend easy and serve their purpose
The item was exactly as described and a great deal for the price I paid.
"I really think these are great! Lots of silver ware for a great price! The steak knives are really nice. The large spoons are overly large, more like serving spoons. But all in all...Very pleased!"
Cheap material. Steak knives aren‚Äôt even sharp. Very disappointed.
I would've love to give this silverware 5 stars but most of them are not polished correctly and the edges are a bit sharp. Hopefully you'll get a set that is properly polished.
There is no way that this cutlery is what is described in the listing. It all rusted after the FIRST wash. We have silverware from IKEA that at least took years to rust. Pretty sure this is the lowest quality possible.  I am returning both sets of these immediately.
Son de muy buen material est√°n muy bien
These silverware set is nice.
Love my new silverware. Perfect weight and strudy. Easy clean and sleek look.
"I recently moved into my very first apartment on my own. As a lot of people know, it can get really expensive really fast. This set was an affordable option and works great. My only complaint is that when left to dry, they get really bad water spots. However, if you know this isn't your forever silverware set that you want to pass on to the grandchildren, this will work just great for you"
"The product seems a good value, but the picture is deceptive because it shows serving utensils. The product DOES NOT include serving utensils so let the buyer beware."
"Was hoping to get a great value, but got exactly what I paid for. This feels like cheap dollar store flatware. The edges feel like they were stamped out of sheet metal and not polished or finished at all. This will be going into the camper for occasional use and don‚Äôt care if it gets lost. I would not set my table at home with this low quality ware."
Much smaller than expected and very thin.. but it wasn't expensive so.....
This is good set silver wear as long as your not trying to impress anyone
Nice and sharp but the handle broke
Just a little bulky for the big spoon and forks but I‚Äôm going to keep them as my first starter set.
3 stars because this has no dessert spoons or small forks!!
"So I had purchased a well-reviewed set of name-brand black silverware prior to buying these. The 1st set, the black just came off with simple washing. Note, I do not have a dishwasher...so just hand-washing was ruining them. With that frustration, I settled on these. I have had ZERO issue with these, as I tend to wait to review a product until I have had a good chance to use them for awhile. SO, if you are unsure about all the black silverware out there - I would strongly suggest looking into these. They are durable and stunning."
"Perfect flatware for daily use. Sturdy, large and not lightweight like other stuff I have. I just hope the spoons don‚Äôt all disappear like my last set!!!"
"Very nice quality of silverware. Does not water spot. Great, simple design. Good price."
I am in LOVE with this set. I bought two to have enough sets for my amount of plates. And love them so far. It's been a couple of months and they clean up just as nice as they did when I bought them. Still the color and shine I look for. And still just as sturdy.  The value is really where I am happy. These were the best valued set I found and at first was worried.... Thinking they would fall apart or the finish would disintegrate.  So far I was wrong. Good set.
The flatware is heavier than I thought it would be. They come out of the dishwasher shiny with no spots. I was concerned about that and relieved. They are a good set for the price
"This flatware is well-made, sturdy, and looks nice on the table. Has had multiple trips through the dishwasher and so far all is well. Very happy with this purchase."

"Basically all we wanted was a matching set of flatware because we had a bunch of mismatched knives, forks and spoons from years of marriage. For the money I spent I wasn't expecting anything more than that __just a matching group of flatware! Therefore you can imagine our surprise when we got this product. The sets are beautifully made and look very nice! When washed in the dishwasher none of them spotted or stained! They cleaned up nicely. I feel like I am stealing a little bit because the price was so low! Highly recommend this flatware!"
"II have tried several flatware sets over the years; they have always been flimsy and bend just by looking at them. Until now! Packaging was perfect! No scratches at all! Each utensil was protected, but not to the point where it will take you more than a few seconds to remove the protection. Very nice weight! I will admit that I've never seen a spoon (not the teaspoon) this large. But for me, it's perfect! I highly recommend!"
"I am absolutely amazed by the quality of this flatware! So much quality for under $40.00. First of all, it is beautiful, shines like real silver. Secondly, it is the quality you would expect from a highline not this price point. It is heavy, not cheap stamped on the back flatware.  I bought the 45 piece 2 days ago and turned around and bought the 40 piece today and threw all my old flatware in the trash.  I expect this to be the last everyday flatware I will ever buy."
"I had been looking for heavy-duty silverware with longer forks for a long time - these fit the bill perfectly. They have a good heft to them without being too weighty. I love the size of the tablespoons - almost serving size really and the teaspoons are as big as my old tablespoons. I know some folks said they were too big, but they are exactly what I was looking for. I wish you could buy the forks separately - would love to have another set for that reason but don't need the rest of them. Anyway, I'm happy, happy, happy and if you have hesitated about buying these - don't! Buy them. One more thing, I've put them in the dishwasher many times and they come out perfect."
"Neutral styling maybe modern if anything, clean lines, nice weight, a bit big not for tiny hands but not overly large. Knifes are offset so can cut through without striking your knuckles. Finish is nice shiny looks very nice. Great for everyday use and after a few dishwashes still looks nice. Great value"
"I was very impressed with the thickness and weight of this set. They are a much heavier gauge that the set they are replacing. They may be a little larger than my old set but are by no means bulky. I have used them for a few months and I have not found any that are sharp, rough or have any problems with the finish. I have a black porcelin sink, dinerware set and appliances which they match well. A very attractive set. They do need to be dried or my very hard water will spot them up pretty good however, the same is true with my black sink, dinerware and appliances which I am drying anyway so I would expect nothing less. The fact they look so good after washing and drying them makes drying them seam less of a hassel. I'm very happy with the set and would order again."
Purchased this set to replace our missed matched flatware. The set was complete and I inspected each piece. The pieces are medium weight and sturdy it is a good-looking set. I will pdate in a few months to rate the quality.
"This flatware is beautiful and simple. It can go from everyday dinner table to your elegant Christmas party. The weight of each piece is perfect, not to heavy and not to light. Fits comfortably in your hands. My favorite, the salad fork, is not too big and too small it's just right. This set cleans up well too. We hand wash our dishes so I cannot speak to dishwasher effects. My husband actually said he liked the flatware too...his review...""its not busy, it feels right in the hand."" You won't be disappointed."
"I wanted to wait for some time before I reviewed this tableware. Some of the reviews said that these russt easily, but we have not had any such problem. These are very nice quality items. My husband likes a little heavier tableware (must a guy thing), and he really likes these. They wash up easily and have maintained their original luster after hundreds of washes, both by hand and in the dishwasher."
"I was looking for everyday silverware. I didn't want anything too ""fussy."" When I found this, I liked the design and I liked the price. As an added bonus: the knives actually cut! Usually, all table knives are good for is spreading. These knives aren't going to cut your finger, but they do cut a sandwich without smashing it. This was a wonderful added bonus!"
"I was a little apprehensive buying new flatware sight unseen, but I was really quite pleased with this set. It is way heavier than I thought which was a concern that I would get some flimsy lightweight stuff, not these, they look like they will stand the test of time and will not bend. And just really pretty."
Was very happy with this order. The flatware was heavier then I expected. It came fast and was pack very well. I am proud and happy to give this as a gift. Thank you and will recommend. you to friends.
"Smooth, clean, and weighty. I was surprised by the quality of this cutlery. I've used them for about one month now and I continue to be pleased with the quality. Do not hesitate to buy! A++"
"These are great...You get 8pcs of knives, serving spoon, regular spoons, dinner forks and salad forks. They are sturdy and just the right weight."
"I purchased this set. The pattern was the closest to my current silverware set. It doesn't weigh in my hand as my current silverware does, but it is sturdy, and looks durable, and I think will be a great value for the money. I have been looking for additional pieces to my current silverware and I look forward to using using this set for family dinners!"
"Just started using them, had costly French silverware , course it is all made in China. :((( but like this set, just better NOT rust, as one reviewer stated above. Will be continued......"
I am so very happy with this purchase. I read some of the other reviews and almost didn't order. Silverware has been put in the dishwasher several times since I purchased and it's still beautiful. Sturdy and has some weight to it. Very pleased!
I've been using this flatware for about 2 weeks. There are a good weight without being too heavy (the reason I got rid of my last set). Great size. So far holding up well to dishwashing. Very pleased so far.
I was looking for something different to match my new dishes. This silverware set is it! Sleek looking and functional. Durable and wash well in the dishwasher. Color shines through with no problem of discoloration. Bought additional sets. Also have received lots of compliments.
Love these stainless steel set the best ever strong don't bend cleans great stays shiny wash after wash and the price wow! This set will last me until I will Expire! Timothy Ellis
Amazing for the price! They feel like high end silverware but for a fraction of the cost. These are a nice addition to our camper!‚ù§Ô∏è
"Durable, shiny, classy. Looks more expensive then they are. Includes great care instructions to keep them in new level appearance. Very happy with product."
"These are probably some of the sturdiest and durable sets of silverware. I was extremely surprised. They are very nice, absolutely love them!"
"I love how shiny and comfortable everything is. I can't believe I got this nice of a set for what I paid. There's only one thing that I was disappointed in and that was the size of the salad forks, but I don't really use those so no big deal. Delivery was fast and it was a no hassle deal. I would recommend this set and this seller."
I bought these for my travel trailer. Love them. Strong and nice looking.
I had to buy anew set as the movers lost our silverware. They are nice looking great price
"I like the size of the utensils, the feel, the weight, I am glad that we purchased these. Worth the money."
This flatware is perfect for my family. The flatware is abused and still holds up like new.
Weight of the utensils Is very important to me. I don‚Äôt want the handle to be too thin you think you might break it and I‚Äôm not really fond of too much art on the end of Your utensil. I purchased this blind faith from the Internet and got just what I wanted
The bottom of the flatware is wide enough that I can put in my dishwasher and it doesn‚Äôt get stuck in the bottom of the rack. Beautiful. Very pleased.
I was surprised at the quality. Sturdy and a good weight which is important in silverware.
"I was so surprised at how lightning fast my order arrived - like, one day! Very nice silverware. Good price too."
Very pleased with this set. They do not appear cheap but instead are sturdy and appear as if they'll last for years.
"I use the flatware for everyday use. The utensils are attractive, highly polished, and sturdy. A good value."
Liked the design. Subdued but attractive.
"They are very well made, and doesn't feel cheap."
Stainless flatware set is very nice. Flatware is sturdy and dishwasher safe. Very satisfied with our purchase.
I was pleasantly surprised to see the high quality of this silverware and I like it very much. Came well packaged too.
"These came on time and were perfect. Not too heavy, well balanced, good sized teaspoons that appear too large but are great, knife is serrated so it cuts well. Would but again for sure."
Good silverware at a good price. Comfortable to use.
Beautiful set of silverware. Very sturdy. Great quality.
Great quality for the money. Purchased two sets as we always run out between wash cycles. Nice to be able to get a nice set of utensils without the extra pieces you never use.
"I haven‚Äôt used these much as yet, but I like that they are Plain because food won‚Äôt get lodged in between some design, etc"
"I haven't bought a new set of silverware in YEARS. I researched this brand and if course, found it on Amazon. Very, very happy! Easy to clean, sturdy and pretty."
"Looks good and works well, has a good feel to it, i would have preferred shorter handles, forks feel like long handled shovels."
This is a good set for the price. The pieces are large enough and heavy enough. The finishing is good.
Great quality!
"This silverware set is very sturdy. ""Feels"" like the more expensive brands. Is nice because it is a very neutral pattern so goes with everything and comes with a lot of pieces. Very pleased!"
Great silverware. Sleek looking. Would recommend.
"The quality of the whole surpassed my expectations, the price was very reasonable too, I have recommended this to my friends."
"As ""The Kids"" moved away (finally) and got my regular silverware together, I saw that I was missing a lot of them. This silverware is at a great price and very well made. Good weight, all well rounded edges and color as advertised. Just go for them, don't search any longer."
Was thinking it was going to be 'light' but it has a good feel and is sturdy to use. Very happy with our choice.
The flatware arrived as described. Hopefully they will continue to look as nice as they do now.
"We just received this so cannot rate on durability yet, but it matches our current silverware perfectly."
Flatware worked out great love the long & short forks. So far still shining! Would buy again.
Beautiful and classic set.
I‚Äôve been using for a couple of weeks and this flatware is holding up beautifully. It still looks new after several washing in the dishwasher.
The silverware is a beatiful collection for being a plan design
Perfect basic set of silverware. Large and small forks and spoons
Awesome set for the money. Heavy duty and sharp looking too. Love this set. Great value
A gift for my daughter and she is so pleased with them
"Very impressed, sturdy & shiny. As far as durability don‚Äôt know, they were just put out a few days ago."
I loved this set of flatware utensils. Very good quality and strong.

These were an AWSOME buy. And it came with the straws which make it the perfect combo. I would definitely recommend
Lovely place setting I like how our dining table looks with these place settings
Love them!!
"Aunt Deborah Stole my Black Silverware Set  Decided to pick up this unique flatware set for eight to use at a recent dinner party. No one in my family has ever seen stainless steel silverware with a mirror polished black finish before that day. My uncle was the only relative who didn‚Äôt care for them. He said the mirror polished made them look fake. Have no idea what he‚Äôs talking about? Think my uncle Ray drank too much Corn whiskey that morning.  Each piece in this set has a nice solid weight to it. Beautiful flower laser pattern on the handle adds an air of subtle elegance especially in a formal table setting. The steak knives deliver that final shock factor to anyone seeing them for the first time.  Wish they came packaged in a wooden case, instead of a paperboard box. Product presentation is important to me.  My aunt Deborah really like this flatware set a lot. Didn‚Äôt realize how much until the next day when I noticed the paperboard box I put them back in after cleaning was missing. Told me she‚Äôll bring them back in a few weeks. I don‚Äôt believe that for this isn‚Äôt the first time she covertly ‚ÄúBorrowed‚Äù something from my house. Been two years since she appropriated our stainless-steel stockpot in the same fashion.  Just keep your eye on sticky finger relatives if you happen to pull this EUIRIO 48-piece black silverware set with steak knives out for a family get together. Don‚Äôt even lend it out for you will never see it again. I promise you that."
"This silverware set is not poor quality but it is not top quality either. Back is just stamped ""Stainless Steel"". There's no logo or brand name. Each piece is fairly heavy and certainly not prone to bend. Knives have the pattern on both sides. Other pieces, only one side. Steak knife handle seems to be made out of some sort of plastic resin. Rivets in the knife handle are well done and heads are flush with the handle. The blade is completely serrated except for the last 3/8"" at the point of the blade.  It seems like this set first had the black finish baked on. The intricate pattern is etched in and therefore reveals the stainless steel finish below. It is a cool look. It will be interesting to see if the black finish scratches or wears off over time. It looks great right now."
"This really weighty tableware. It is not delicate but it is somewhat inspiring. It is not exactly French, nor is it American British Crown influence Victorian. It could have a little of the Muscovite in the design. It even brings forth a hint of the rustic flavor. e sense that it can go with almost any table cloth.  Easy To Clean:  I have used and washed every piece in the set at least three times and it is holding its own so far. I have not really been careful as I wash. Just load the sink with it add my detergent hot water and scrub each piece with a paper towel wad. Noting rubs off and the design is perfectly flat which adds to the ease of washing.  The color has a only the slightest hint of a blue cast so I thought how wonderful to team it up with a set of Mikassa dinnerware that I reviewed.e of months past. (see IMAGE) My only regret is that it did not have a set of butter knives to complete the set perfectly. You can do a simple formal table and do a formal setting with the addition of a butter knife set and ther addition of a bread plate or larger saucer. Ah well, it is not a fault since the seller did not mention a butter knife or include it in the description, It would be nice to know whether a butter knife is available.  STURDINESS:  Again' let me reiterate, it is heavy tableware. It is not dainty and it is not likely ever to bend while in use. The word here is sturdy. I rather prefer the more rugged table utensil and would probably prefer the serrated dinner knives to cut my meat rather than the steak knives that are part of the set. By the way, those steak knives are well made with full tang and three rivets in thke handles of each..  I like this Euirio 48 piece black flatware set with steak knives...a setting for eight. It is a keeper. Order the set and have fun creating striking table settings."
"I love this silverware set! The unique style catches everyone's eye and it adds a layer of beauty to the table. Everyone has silverware, and I've always kept my eyes open to find a way to add some flare, to something that seems to always look the same as what was in my great grandmother's house. This set surpasses anything I could have imagined! Not only are they beauty pieces, they are fully functional. I had some bronze silverware that I was using and I was always told the pieces looked nice, but the salad forks and tea spoons were more like baby utensils and the soup spoons were very flat, not functional. That is not the case here! Every piece is beautiful and functional, even the steak knives are really sharp! The only concern that time will tell is how the pieces hold up through washing. I've been handwashing them and they look great, but I'm sure that my kids will end up getting them in the dishwasher. Also, I'm not sure about sharpening the knives. Still, wouldn't give these up for anything, I love the unique style and the functionality makes these a steal!"
We got this to use in our new home. We decided to start over with a whole new set and this one looked like a great way to do that.  It arrives ready to wash and use. The set also comes in a gift worthy box.  It seems to be well made. The pieces all feel balanced in our hands. The flowers are etched in so they should last as long as the utensils do. The etching is still smooth. There is no hitch or ledge.  They have a nice mouth feel. They were comparable to our stainless steel set to wash.  It is very beautiful in person. We would buy these again.
"This is the most beautiful silverware set I have ever owned. Although I am using them for everyday use, they are pretty and elegant enough to use for a fancy dinner or with your china. They are easily cleaned and seem to be holding up well to use. I love the sizes they give and the quality of each different one. I also love that the set comes with steak knives because usually sets like this do not. I love that it's pretty but also sturdy and they don't feel super light and cheap like some silverware does. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this set."
"This silverware set is gorgeous and they are great quality. These would be amazing to use when you have dinner guests over. They will definitely be impressed with this silverware.  This set includes: -8 Large spoons -8 small spoons -8 Large forks -8 small forks -8 knifes -8 Butter knifes  That‚Äôs 48 pieces of silverware all together.  Overall, I got all of my pieces of silverware and this set looks as advertised. I have no complaints."
"We were surprised how much we liked this black flatware set! It's really different, yet has an elegant look to it.  The surfaces have a nice, smooth feel to them.  Ours arrived nicely packaged and free from scratches or defects.  At Amazon's current price of around $50, you're really only paying about a dollar per piece. Seems like a great value to me.  Highly recommended!!!"
"This flatware set is gorgeous! I love that the pattern is even on the steak knives, that is honestly delightful. They did not lose their luster or any color/pattern when running them thru the dishwasher either!"
This silverware set arrives well packaged with each piece in its own plastic sleeve and is easy to unpack and start enjoying right away. These pieces are so much prettier in person than the picture. They are beautiful pieces of art. They are comfortable to hold. They are a nice weight and not too thin. We love them so very much and highly recommend them.

"Got these to replace an old set i got from Walmart that had been losing pieces. The designs on these are absolutely beautiful. The pictures online didn't really do them justice. I'm hoping they hold up to wear and washing, but so far so good. They're also thick, sturdy metal, not thin and cheap."
Cutlery so stunning you almost don‚Äôt want to eat with it. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. Well made and a high quality set. This would make a great gift but the packaging is not the best so maybe repackage it with a pretty box and it will be the most awesome gift ever.
"I love this set. The design is beautiful. Well made, sturdy. Look and feel great"
Pretty little pattern. Nice balance. Attractive silverware. Matte set.
I only have good things to say about this silverware set. The design is very luxurious and beautiful it is such a nice quality design that is unique and sophisticated in the design. The black background with white roses is amazing and adds so much character to my kitchen. The pieces are all full sized and each item is well made without scuffs or damage. The material is Stanless steel and beautifully made. This set is designed for special occasions and should be handled carefully for best use. It is recommended to handmade and not use steel wool or hard detergents. These should be dried right away after cleaning. This set is amazing and I love that it has matching steak knives. Buy these if you need a beautiful luxury set for dinner parties or entering. This set is nice enough to be in your China cabinet.
"We've been mixing and matching a couple sets for years now, so seeing this setting for 8 was great. Not only does it include a full set for dining for 8, but there is a beautiful pattern. These have a nice weight to them and seem very well made. Been through the dishwasher a few times now with no noticeable wear and tear other than where two knives hit each other on the serration. I do have a concern about longevity with the finish, as one of our knives new already came with a blemish, but so far no new blemishes. The steak knives seem to have a poorer finish than the rest of the set, so with good care hopefully will hold up as well as the rest of the set. I love the way these look and feel and bought a second set to save for the big get-togethers with family/friends."
"This set of flatware (blackware???) is stunning. I have a black and white decor in my kitchen and dining room. For holidays or seasons I add of touch of color too. But for this occassion I stayed with black and white only. Guests were dumbfounded by this set. I think they spent more time admiring the pieces than actually using them.  Each is properly weighted so they do not feel inexpensive. The design does not chip or rub off. Each is very comfortable to hold regardless of gender or hand size. The steak knife cuts through a thick cut of beef with ease.  My only complaint is how they are packaged. These beautiful utensils deserve to be in a nice wooden box, not jammed into a thin piece of cardboard. If in a nice box they would make a fabulous wedding gift."
"- Made in China  I've been seeing this set for at least a year and a half, flooding in from the foreign Alibaba-esque resellers. I thought it was busy but pretty but just never took the plunge. Saw them again now and finally decided to try them.  These are the same as all the rest in a couple of areas but happily better in a couple of others.  First, the 'active' edges, while not as smooth as most real brand flatware, is still much better than usual.  The table knife also is perfect. Not too much serration, having it only on the one side, and the butt end isn't too sharp.  Unfortunately the butt end of everything else is rough. Not enough to cut but can be irritating.  The steak knives are also terrible. Huge, wide serration, much too strong. Rips and shreds instead of cuts.  Fork tines are just slightly pokey  Tablespoon is huge, closer to a serving spoon, but I don't care about that. The bowl size of both is good.  I do love the design even though it's quite busy. Especially the part that extends into the 'working' end. A solid 4 stars for me.  Be sure to price check, there's still dozens of these sets out there.

So I am convinced that I have trolls stealing my silverware bc several times a year I find myself needing more. I have sons and all my friends say that‚Äôs it but surely not üòúüòÇ. I‚Äôm thankful for this option. I just order one every 3 months and I don‚Äôt want to scream anymore. Maybe when the eldest moves out I can have nice things - until then this works and is beautiful and cheap. Good luck moms ü•∞
In the groves of the knife's there is black residue not sure if its rust or not but when you cut through bread it leaves black stuff on the food..I do not have them very long
Purchased these for my single son. Never has anything much above plastic takeout ...For the price my expectations were low. But I am visiting and I like food. I am thinking on buying a couple more for backup with him and myself. Definitely exceeded my expectations.
Perfect! Great value for the money!
This silverware set is a great quality product......
Wanted to add some pieces to the set i have for everyday use - seems that spoons and knives are always missing. This set is much nicer than my current set. Size and weight are substantial. Really like this set. Might order another set and get rid of my old set. Very happy with my purchase.
I got this set in silver. We love how heavy duty these are. My bf can't stop talking about the spoons. I have scrubbed them and they have been through washer several times. I was nervous about rub off but there has been zero. These are better than others I've bought that were way more expensive. Definitely worth it. I really wanted the gold but I ordered the silver just in case. I was nervous it would rub off.
Purchased for my mom and she said she loved the set!
I was looking for extra silverware for entertaining and these fit the bill perfectly. The pieces are very nice in design and sturdy. Also at a great price which is a plus!
These are very sturdy and bigger than I expected! We love these! I will be ordering more of these again soon.
"Good price for regular silverware. Nothing crazy expensive feeling, but good enough for the price"
"I needed some additional flatware for my vacation home. The old set had plastic grips and they were getting brittle/breaking. Ordered this set and was surprised how nice they feel, should last a long time! Highly recommend for budget flatware!"
Love the large spoons and forks compared to other silverware. Manageable. Easy to use
Great bang for your buck if you got kids that like to throw your silverware in the trash can.
Sturdy durable n just what I was looking for
We bought these for use in our RV. So far they're great.
"I was impressed with the quality of the sliver wear set, being through college I‚Äôve used some cheap sets, but this one is best for the buck. The edges are polished and not rough, so they are very comfortable to eat with."
"Their great, I bought them for Our RV."
"This is a great set, the so called teaspoon is the size of a tablespoon n thlargrine is a great serving spoons. I don‚Äôt miss a smaller spoon at all."
I love these ‚Ä¶ will definitely order again. I‚Äôve had them for 4 months now and have had no problems.
Son muy pr√°cticos y f√°cil de limpiar los recomiendo
Good value for the money
Perfect design to blend in with my other pieces. Sturdy and the size is serviceable.
"Easy clean, easy hold, the price was right."
We need a new silverware set and this one was perfect for the money
Great quality and looks amazing
Love how quality of silver was despite lower price love also the size of them
"These are well made cutlery, great balance."
Simple set for an affordable price  Feels heavy in a sturdy way (not at all a bad thing)
"These are very nice. They‚Äôre heavy and solid. At the price point, I wasn‚Äôt expecting such high quality silverware!"
Very pleased with this choice. Very good quality and beautiful.
Works great.
These are of good quality .
Good value
They are better quality than i expected for the price point.
Does the job
They're a little big but worth the money
"Nice, sturdy, well-made silverware set. No super sharp edges or weird feels to them."
"I haven't used these long enough to review. Initially, they seem fine."
"Has no shown through any rust spots yet, good purchase."
Very sturdy
Great price for a gorgeous set!
Definitely worth it;
30 pieces for this price‚Ä¶. Excellent!!
"I liked the silverware very much, it was a great occasion solver."
Nice basic set of silverware
I like the feel and look
Good value for the money.
Very good small silverware for the kids and big silverware for the adults
Good product recommend
Will definitely purchase again
Love it
"Very sturdy , not flimsy use every day!"
I would definitely buy again
I am very pleased with my purchases.
a nice set for 6 people
Great value for the price
I bought this set for our motorhome. Its functional and looks good. Perfect for camping. Inexpensive enough that it's pretty carefree!
Muy bueno. Buen grosor. Pero debes secarlos luego de lavarlos porque se manchan f√°cilmente.
"I am not impressed. These feel okay but too heavy, large, and awkward for me (I‚Äôm a woman who wears small size gloves). I was hoping to just use them for around six months till I‚Äôll be able to get something better, but that‚Äôs not going to happen. I‚Äôve washed them twice in the dishwasher and there are spots of rust forming on them. Not impressed and honestly quite disappointed. I‚Äôll need to start looking for new cutlery since these are not going to last. Highly recommend you choose something else."
This is a functional set. Very average quality. A little thin and light for my liking but okay for the price and will do the job.
"I bought this Silverware Set for my daughter. It was a great Value for the amount of Silverware I bought her. They look nice. They are very sturdy. They are used each day, and come out really nice after putting them through all dishwasher cycles."
Good for up to the trailer.
Good and sturdy
It was a gift
Perfect! Very economical packaging!!
"I really like this set, everything feels right and their are no real balance issues with these. I need another set and serving utensils."
I agreed with someone else comment who said that when you washed them you have to use a cloth or it will stay with water stain. You have to dry them if you don‚Äôt want them with water stain
The silverware that you get for the price is definitely worth it. Love the different sizes and quantity. Would purchase again!
This set of Silverware is very nice. I would recommend buying it.
I was pleased that the design is simple and included a lot of the silverware set in one purchase. Only annoying thing is the steak knives rust. I put them in the dishwasher and check the next day and every other one appears to have rust spots. Bummer. I just rewash and scrub the crap out of them by hand.
"These silverware apparently never got their final polish. The edges of the handles are actually sharp enough to cut your skin. The fork tines are so flimsy that no fork has their tines lined up straight. Lastly, there is no heft to these. They are very thin and light. The steak knives are nice and sharp, but the tang is wider than the plastic portion of the handle. Overall, they simply aren‚Äôt made or machined very well."
I ordered these because we bought a new house and wanted new items for the home. I waited to give my review for after use. While everything came in a timely manner and looked beautiful after a few uses and dish washing the silverware has started to rust. This is not how silverware should be after only a few uses. Very displeased.
"For the price, these are a bargain! My set came with each utensil type bagged and tied together. Each individual piece is then wrapped in another plastic sleeve. So there were to scuffs or sharp edges on any of them. Heft wise, I'd say they're slightly below medium. So nothing super solid, but definitely not lite and cheap feeling. Again, for the price, these are a no brainer."
"We love this set! Nice and shiny, no scratches. The pieces are light but not in a cheap feeling or cheap looking way. I am glad I took a chance on these, especially considering the price. 10/10 would buy again!"
"At first I was really happy with quantity for the money spent and how light they were. Now that we have used them we realized that the corners on the area where they are held are sharp and has nicked us. Now I am reading that they rust easily as well. I would not recommend these utensils at all, especially if you have children like I do."
"This set is very nice. Very good weight. Not too heavy, not too light. Pretty, and smooth. Just recently ordered a different set from another seller and had to return those due to much roughness on the edges. These are great and love the style of the spoon! Feels good in your mouth and the flatware is comfortable to hold. Excellent value."
"I needed a full set of silverware for normal everyday use that was affordable, and this works. The knives are good and I really like the shape and feel of the spoons. The forks are alright but wish they were designed slightly differently.  If you just want silverware and aren't too picky, these are pretty good."
"I did not expect these to be so sturdy and perfect. Very cool looking set! (We went for the rainbow set.) My younger children hold them easily and they are shiny and look polished with simple dishwashing. Easy to clean off the stuck on grime from 4 boys. No fades, chips, or scratches after a couple of months and constant use. Love the amount of utensils you get at a great price. Great deal! I will probably buy another set for backup."
The 48 piece set recieved was surprisingly strong and rigid even in comparison to more expensive sets or even in cases of some restaurant tableware. Very satisfied with the strength. There is no give and no bend in these spoons and forks. I am confident the spoons will not bend scooping ice cream and the forks won't bend cutting food on a plate. Set should last a lifetime and not disappoint.
"I love this new set I just bought from Amazon! It‚Äôs so easy to hold onto! It fits your hand so nice. My old utensils had wooden handles and they were bulky, maybe more for a man‚Äôs hand. So these fit me much better now! They are easy to wash and dry easily too! The steak knives are sharp and do their job well. Overall, I love this whole set! Thanks!"
"The steak knife comes with a heavy paper sleeve which is great for safety. The regular flatware is light weight, I would prefer a bit more. They fit my hands nicely. Good purchase for the price. I don‚Äôt know how well the finish will stay shiny"
I was pleased with the cutlery.. I ordered because it had steak knives included which are greAt
"I just received these and haven't tried them out yet but they look very nice so far. I can't speak to the rusting issue, as I haven't used them yet but even if they do rust after several uses its still cheaper than plastic utensils so I'll take the gamble. The box the package arrived in was in a sorry state but I don't blame the seller for that issue."
"I am especially pleased with the quality of this inexpensive set. Especially with the Steak knifes. Very sharp and durable, even the butter knifes with the serrated edges are sharp enough to cut with. I really like the smooth finish to these pieces, it makes them very easy to clean. I hope the finish holds up on them and doesn't rust. So far I am very happy with the service I received and the product."
"I purchased this silverware set to replace my current set. At it's $28 price point, I was afraid that I'd get a box of tin, but was pleasantly surprised at how well made and sturdy this set is. The steak knives look and feel very high quality. An absolute treasure of a set. Highly recommend."
"This rainbow utensil set is beautiful, has great weight, and has both full sized and salad forks, and a full set of steak knives, regular and soup spoons. I feel happy every time I use a utensil! In spite of advice to towel dry after washing to prevent spotting, my utensils air dry without spots."
"I love this set of flatware! It's the only one I've come across that includes the steak knives - and are they sharp! The flatware is shiny and easy to wash. Just the perfect weight, too. Not too heavy and not too light."
Heavy solid silverware. Washes and polishes easy.
"I was so tired of mismatched silverware that I decided it was time for something new. I found these and even though they are plain, they are very pretty. The one thing I don't care for is how easily they water spot. Other than that I love them."
This was exactly what I needed- has everything and it‚Äôs all new and shiny and easy to clean Would definitely recommend
"You get what you pay for. If you treat this set with care it will last. Do not let it sit dirty with food or in a sink full of water. Wash, Dry and put it back in the drawer."
"I am renovating the kitchen, I put all the flatware I already owned in bins. We ate from plasticware. I bought this so we could eat from real flatware, again. It did not disappoint. The price is reasonable and the quality exceptional for the price."
"I ordered these to have as extra/spare flatware for our large family gatherings. They stand tall in mason jars to easily pull them out of the cabinets for use during holidays, birthdays and gatherings."
I like the weight and sturdiness and they are elegant looking. They fit my hands well. They clean very nicely without much water spots. So far no rust spots at all. The steak knives are sharp to cut a steak with ease. We ordered another set for our camper.
I really loved my new silverware until I noticed one of my spoons was already starting to show some rust stains
"So far, so good. Very nice quality for the price. You do need to scrub the knives a little bit to get the black stuff out of the grooves. I didn‚Äôt, and noticed it on the food when I used them to cut/spread."
I bought two sets for every day use. My family loves them. They wash great in the dish washer!!
"Fast delivery and quality for every day use is great. Due to nerve damage in my hand round or of shaped silverware is hard for me to hold. These are flat and light, I have no problems holding them at all."
Havnt had them but just a day but they are beautiful to look at! They was wrapped well and are very solid and sturdy! Knifes have a good edge sharp! Love the colors!
It isn‚Äôt often you can find a flatware set that includes steak knives. Excellent bang for your buck. We warned every piece is individually wrapped in plastic and rubber banded.
I would recommend getting some of your own. They are high quality. I love them.
Exactly as described. They are very nice and affordable. Would definitely recommend.
Great silverware for the price. Sturdy enough for everyday use and holds up in the dishwasher.
I‚Äôve read and have seen pictures of some sets rusting/discolored but bought them regardless as they‚Äôre more good reviews than the bad. Utensils are perfect! Have had them for 2 month and no rust! Love the shape and how light they are.
"We sent the wrong item at first, buy was quickly corrected. The silverware is very nice. Has good weight to it. Not too heavy, not too light. Looks great. I'm very happy with this purchase"
Very slick silverware. They hold up very well in the dishwasher in the sink when cleaning. A nice design when setting the table. Modern style and very well-made.
SO SLEEK STYLISH and easy to clean. No rusting yet but this is a great way to set your kitchen up. You neeeeed matching cutlery seriously. This is giving minimal high fashion and the set comes with enough for the whole family. I am tempted to get another set just because.
I am using this for my everyday silverware. What I had was a mismatched mess. Now I have a nice matching set.
Perfect for daily use brought this up for my eldest daughter and her family very nice - Not heavy and feels very nice when handling it
"I personally needed silverware so I was so excited when I got this. Good price, extra silverware in case I ever have extra people over and it came in early!"
"Nothing fancy, they do what they need to do. They wash well in the dish washer. How can you beat the price? The steak knifes alone are probably sold at this price. We were goign to buy in Ikea but the line there is insane, plus Amazon delivers....no brainer."
"I‚Äôve been using this set for a few months now and really enjoy it! My only problem with it, is that I notice the tip of the knives can get rusty quickly. Not sure if it‚Äôs just mine, but other than that everything is great! I‚Äôd repurchase it again!"
"Great set for a family, more than enough for a fam of 4 or more. I thought I‚Äôd have to buy two sets but I didn‚Äôt need them."
You get a lot of items packed into this purchase you get everything you need it was well worth it and very good starter kit
"I was very impressed with this collection considering the price is amazing! They feel so nice and sleek when handling. I would definitely recommend; if I ever need more, I will buy from this seller again!üòä"
"Was very pleased when I received my silverware set. The forks are of a good quality, does not bend. Knives are sharp. Great product for the price."
Impressed overall with make and sturdiness. Silverware so far hasn't rusted. Looks cool.
Very well made utensils. Beautiful design with a nice weight to them. They look a lot more expensive than they are.
"The set is perfect. It's sturdy enough so the forks don't bend and the spoons can dish out hard icecream without bending. They look expensive, but not"
We use this silverware at every meal and it‚Äôs durable. No marks ir scratches on it yet.
"I was kind of skeptical at the price and reviews, but I got mine and they had none of the issues that the other reviewers had claimed. I think they look super elegant!"
"How the quality?, so the time will tell because I use those only for a month now so see see?.."
Pleasantly surprised with the quality. The steak knives are great.
These utensils are remarkably sturdy and have a good weight to them. Very pleased considering how affordable this set is.
"I have 3 boys and over the years silverware has gone missing and very mismatched...as one can imagine. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but wanted matching silverware. I got these on a whim and didn't have a lot of cash, I was pleasantly impressed."
Does what it says on the tin. Perfectly serviceable flatware.
"I personally love this set. The bad reviews are inevitable with any company you buy from but I seriously have no complaints. I love the feel of the utensils, perfectly sized and weighted."
This set is perfect for a couple or single moving out for the first time. I especially liked that steak knives were included. Exactly what my granddaughter needed and she loves it.
It is what it says and steak knives are sharp good purchase
Simple design. Exactly as described. Nice that the steak knives were included.
We really love this for our home decor
I'm a guy so as long as the food gets to my face easily I am good. These fit nice in my hand and do not tip when carring food to my pie hole. My favorite thing about these utensils are that the spoons are fully capable of scooping out ice cream without bending.
Pleased with purchase. Have washed a few times in dishwasher and product maintained sturdiness/finish.
"They work as well as any silverware should.  Accidentally stabbed myself while grabbing a steak knife drop the dishwasher, can confirm the knifes are sharp. 5/5 would wash them again."
This is not your flimsy silverware that you would get from a discount store. They do have some weight to them.
This flatwear has a nice finish that seems to be very durable. It has sufficient weight to feel sturdy and of good quality.
"Everything you need, I've had them for a couple of months and the knives are sturdy for their purpose and flatware is evenly weighted and easy to clean. Big thumbs up"
The only downside is the knives rusted almost immediately after getting wet.
liked the rainbow color
"Wow! The picture does not do it justice!! I am so glad I purchased these! I have never seen such beautiful silverware in my life! I noticed as I was putting them away, it barely kept my finger print, that is how beautifully polished and high quality they are! Thank you team Briout! And the beautiful Thank You card in the box!! Now that is real customer service!"
"Bought as a gift for my sister, and she's very happy with them. They're durable and hold up to moderate abuse. She's got a household of kids, so anything that can stand up to that must be good."
"I love these. They are really plain, but they have a nice weight to them and a good price. We bought them for our camper. The only reason I rated them a four star (and I may come back and give it a five star after I've had them for a few months) is that they came with a warning not to leave them in water or food as they could rust. They are supposed to be stainless steel, soooo the rust warning is concerning to me. But, we'll see. I'm not planning on leaving them in water or food, but I will be watching for rust."
I was very pleased with this silverware. Wasn't sure what to expect as they were reasonably priced. Very nice looking. Sturdy and we'll made.
Beautiful set. So glad I purchased this set.
They feel pretty sturdy not at all cheep and flimsy. They work wonderfully for there intended purpose and are easy to clean and haven't shown any signs of rusting. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. üòä
"Decent, inexpensive flatware. No sharp edges. Decent weight. Comfortable to use. I bought for my picnic bag but will probably buy another to fill in my kitchen drawer."
This set of silverware works good for my camper
Great design sturdy and great for big families.
"Very nice set of silverware! Came quickly, and no issues with them in the dishwasher!"
Looking it
"I am very pleased to say, I love this setü§ó"
Love this set
"The utensils are sleek and long, and the addition of salad forks are a bonus."
I‚Äôm happy
A bit lightweight and small for man hands but good overall value
Family liked it
Love this flatware !! Simple yet elegant!!
Nice love it
I like my order.
Very nice quality
Really good heavy but not too heavy utensils
I love it
Surprising quality.
Looks great!
"Bought for my son to take to college, great value."
Very nice
I use them for thanksgiving simple elegant
"Nice, low cost flatware set."
Good for the price!
Very nice pieces
Nicer than I thought.
Bueno y barato
Very nice and good price
Bought it for my daughter & she is very happy with it.
Home use
Very happy
"I do not believe these will hold up past a year, maybe two, and should probably return them. My youngest kids like the tiny size of the smallest fork and spoon but I do not. They‚Äôre too small and the larger fork and spoon are too big. They‚Äôre not heavy in any way (step above your cheap flatware in a restaurant) and fingerprints show up easily. Again, I should return them but I have waited two weeks to receive them and my youngest kids love the tiny forks and spoons. Definitely would not recommend the purchase of these.  Updated: after having about a week. I‚Äôm returning flatware. The tiny fork and spoon, the handle bend and weight just are not satisfactory."
Had to get a rotary tool out to dull the ends of the butter knives because I cut myself on one of them!!! I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to return these though because I like everything else about them so far. Can‚Äôt beat the price.
"High quality set. Not packaged for a wedding, but if you're looking to purchase silverware, this is a great set. I am super picky about the size of my silverware, I like mine on the smaller side, and these and definitely on the bigger side. Great for guys. I still like then though."
"The set is very basic, but at the same time they work very well. so far they are still shiny and easy to clean. I haven't had any of them stain so far."
They rusted in a few spots and I haven‚Äôt had them long. Other then that they‚Äôre great.
I love this set... But I am not a fan on how big the forks and spoons are. I like smaller silverware. But they are very nice
Very plain jane but great for those who are just starting out. Serves their purpose and affordable
Okay
Not unhappy that i purchased sturdy silverware
"The package was totally broken, but everything is fine without that problem. Also, I don't know what is black residues inside in bags, it's washable and fine....."
"I ordered two of these and one if then was missing two spoons. Posted to company but they never responded. It is good flatware, the company just doesn't care if you are getting what you ordered"
Cheap not good quality
Sigh... the tea spoon is way too big and the spoon to use to eat with is also the same.
This set delivered quickly and is exactly as described.
Well no small spoons to use.They are all to big to eat a bowl if cereal with
Do not buy this product. I had the set for only 2 weeks when it started showing signs of significant scratching that I haven‚Äôt had with other silverware. Although the look nice they are defective. Tom
Checked all the boxes! Quality/ Balance /Simple Elegance For Crazy Cheap! (& Mom loves them!)  (Would like to get more teaspoons For Ice Cream & Long Tea spoons to match)
Very sturdy. Much better than I thought they would be.
I absolutely love them.
These were a gift for our daughter and her new place. She loves them!!!
"Guys, for this amount of money I wouldn't dare to expect this quality. There are amazing!!!"
Exelente producto me encantaron ü§©
Do NOT waste your money. This silverware set is rusting after literally one wash!!! So cheaply made
"I waited a while before doing a review for these to simply be certain that they could hold up/last for more than a month with the insanity that is at any given time 2 teens and 5 grandkids. They have indeed. I've put them thru the dishwasher and we primarily handwash everything and these beauties dry perfectly. They've got ""heft"" to them; to mean you know you have one in your hand and not some flimsy thing. I really love this set and am beyond thrilled to have ordered them!"
Used them for a bday party and was going to dispose of them after. Decided to keep them after all. They are sturdy and great for any occasion.
"Bought these utensils for the break room at work. Super nice, sturdy, great price."
So shiny
Basic and beautiful. You cannot beat the price.
Beautiful! Just beautiful üòç
"As elegant as these pieces look on a webpage, they are even more beautiful looking in our kitchen. Recent dinner guests remarked on how much they liked the set. One thing I really like is the weight. It feels substantial. I looked at these for months before purchasing them, thinking they were too stylish. But when we use them, they make us feel more stylish! We bought one set, and then realized we wanted enough pieces so we weren't having to fish used ones out of the dishwasher. So we bought a second set. We're extremely pleased."
"It took awhile to get these due to a mailing issue but Amazon resolved it quickly. They are stunning! The style is unique, they are very attractive. The handle is shaped to make cutting easier, they are heavy and well made. We had steak tonight and it cut easily y with the new knives. I‚Äôm very pleased with this item."
Just love this set! Bought another one after I received the first set so I have service for 8. Better than I expected.
Everything was as described and very happy with the quality.
"These look like something Tim Burton designed. The big fork and little fork are almost identical in size, but the big spoon and little spoon are light years apart. The knives for whatever reason accumulate this weird gunk on the teeth every time I wash them in the dishwasher no matter how clean they are before I put them in. I can‚Äôt explain it. Also probably the most frustrating thing about the entire set is that the way the knives were designed, you can‚Äôt set them down on anything without them shooting off of the plate or jar that you placed them on. Extremely unbalanced and awkward. I am going to give these away to my local thrift store or maybe I will make some art out of them with my welder so I don‚Äôt cause anybody else the torment that I have with them‚Ä¶"
"I'm very particular about flatware, and I did a lot of research before this purchase. This set from Jashii turned out to be a perfect decision! It looks great, definitely different than what you would see at even high-end chain stores. I've owned black flatware before and love how durable it is, I did a little 'scrape' test when I got this set and it didn't scratch! This set will look new for a long time. I'm very happy there are options for other items like the steak knives, salad spoon/fork tosser, etc. so I can round out my set. Very happy with my purchase and you will be too!"
Didn‚Äôt realize this silverware was just coated in black paint and it‚Äôs already started to come off after one wash.  Edit: they are sending replacements and it was easy to contact the seller
These knives are very well made. They are perfectly balanced while using - sharp. Like them do well. Planning on buying the four piece place settings.
"They‚Äôre so comfortable to hold in the hand. I never thought that I would be so excited about flatware, but these are amazing and beautiful. The dessert spoons are perfect for my two year old. Will be ordering more soon"
"These were not worth the money whatsoever. They are starting to scuff after the second wash in the sink. Plus, the big spoons are too big for the average persons' mouth."
Looks nice with Uniterky and Jannking flatware though a slightly different handle design.
"So far these are really nice, I like how they feel in my hand. They have a really nice weight and I like how they are shaped. I haven't had them for very long so I'm giving 5 stars for Durability based solely on how they feel right now."
"Gorgeous, comfortable to use. Knife tests easily on plate when edge down. Looking forward to years of use."
Really sharp looking steak knives!!! I'm going to need more just wanted to test them out and they are awesome
They look great but two months in (September now December) and one of the knives has started to rust.
"Nice elegant look, chromatic black color. Only complaint is how badly balanced they are. Not a huge deal, but for the price they should be balanced."
I keep getting compliments. This flatware is beautiful.
I like the look of the silverware but unfortunately the paint has started to chip off. I've only been using it for a month. Very disappointing
The black finish started coming off almost immediately. We are roughly 9 months in and they are ready to be thrown out.
Excellent Product and beautiful . All my guests were impress
Love them!
I love how modern and sturdy these are! Good for kids and adults!  The large spoon is more of a serving size.
El dise√±o y el acabado son muy buenos.
Very good quality
Amazing
"Bought them for a housewarming gift. They are absolutely beautiful, may keep them for myself, haven't used them yet. Only half serrated, no sharp edge after that. Will get back to review afterwards."
"Loved these at first but it‚Äôs been 3 months and multiple pieces are rusting! I‚Äôm very disappointed, especially for the price."
"The stainless steel flatware set looks fantastic on the table, very modern looking, and they feel great in my hand. Excellent experience, i couldnt be more pleased. And I'd gladly recommend this purchase."
Perfect if youre looking for something out of the ordinary. Comfortable to hold and durable.
"This set is very basic, which is what I wanted. Exactly as described. I read reviews saying the steak knives rusted after one wash so I was worried. I have washed them numerous times and there is absolutely no sign of rust. Happy with my purchase!"
My wife and I were surprised by the quality of this set The price we paid for this set is fair and worth the money. We bought these for our camper.
"I need more flatware and saw these and thought, why not for the price. I love them, sturdy, stylish and for what I paid a huge steal. They are now my daily flatware."
Very nice set of stainless steel.
"Can not beat this set for the price! The size/proportions are perfect, they have a nice smooth finish and they are well made. I've bought a similar price set at Walmart before that didn't even come with steak knives and it was junk so I didn't have the highest expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these actually are, especially the steak knives."
Just the right size flatware for a wonderful thanksgiving meal. My grandchildren didn‚Äôt have a problem with them and my fingers can hold them well with my arthritis.
I love this silverware set. It‚Äôs extremely shiny and I love having an extra amount of forks. The knives are very sharp. I‚Äôve washed them multiple times and haven‚Äôt seen any rust (mentioned in other reviews). It‚Äôs perfect for a new home.
"You can NOT go wrong buying this silverware!! It is SO worth the money. Usually it's true that you get what you pay for, but I am telling you, this set is worth EVERY penny spent!!"
The silverware is solid and of good quality! Very good value. Buy today!
"This silverware set is immaculate. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre medium weighted, good length and just overall great. Those steak knives are SHARP. I opened a pack of hotdogs like I was slicing through water. I don‚Äôt think one would be disappointed buying this set."
"These are attractive, smooth, sturdy, and has some weight to them. Totally worth the price."
Overall just as expected. Good quality silverware at a decent price point. Recommend.
"Just moved to a new home and this silverware set was better that I anticipated. They are very sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, and just what my new kitchen needed to complete ‚Äúthe look‚Äù I was going for."
Super fast shipping! Great product with all the pieces that I need for when my daughter moves out on her own.
The silverware are thick enough to use and ware well.
Ordered it for my camper great sec great price .
Great set for the price!
Amazing! Just as described! Great quality for the price. I will probably order another set or two to use at work sites!
"This is an awesome set, for the money even better."
very good price good reviews
"Excellent product for the money! Strong, sturdy silverware perfect for starting a home with."
Very good value and quality for the money
Such a great value for the price. All of the silverware has helped significantly with cooking and place setting.
Nice simple very happy
Great product for the dollar anount
"Looks luxurious! Husband wouldn‚Äôt believe the price, that‚Äôs how you know it was a good purchase."
Just what we needed. Fantastic.!!!
"Very nice set of silverware. It has a good weight, nice polish and easy to clean."
Much better than I had anticipated. heavier and the steak knifes will cut anything...so far :) I would recommend for anyone
Better than I expected! Especially for the price! Sturdy and strong silverware. Would order again.
N/a
The silverware was great and reasonable.
Very good
Like
Exactly what I ordered
This was a great value. Very happy with this purchase. Super fast shipping as well.
This is a great set but be careful with the steak knives...they are extremely sharp. Great for cutting but dangerous when hand washing.. accidentally cut myself ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ.
Everything is great except for the knives. The knives are just trash. Don't even bother
Not the best quality of steel. Useful if you don‚Äôt have anything else but not good for a fancy or formal dinner.
Sturdy and strong. You get a great product for your money
It‚Äôs sturdy silverware but does have some sharp edges on the spoons and stuff. I noticed that a few of them started to get rust spots when I let them dry naturally. I don‚Äôt have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash everything. We do have well water with a water softener system but the other silverware in the house didn‚Äôt rust. Overall it‚Äôs not a terrible deal for what it is. I would buy it again if in a pinch.
The silverware fits my needs
The box was busted open silverware was scratched. Very disappointed.in this order. Make it right..m
These are perfect for my home... They don't bend easy and serve their purpose
The item was exactly as described and a great deal for the price I paid.
"I really think these are great! Lots of silver ware for a great price! The steak knives are really nice. The large spoons are overly large, more like serving spoons. But all in all...Very pleased!"
Cheap material. Steak knives aren‚Äôt even sharp. Very disappointed.
I would've love to give this silverware 5 stars but most of them are not polished correctly and the edges are a bit sharp. Hopefully you'll get a set that is properly polished.
There is no way that this cutlery is what is described in the listing. It all rusted after the FIRST wash. We have silverware from IKEA that at least took years to rust. Pretty sure this is the lowest quality possible.  I am returning both sets of these immediately.
Son de muy buen material est√°n muy bien
These silverware set is nice.
Love my new silverware. Perfect weight and strudy. Easy clean and sleek look.
"I recently moved into my very first apartment on my own. As a lot of people know, it can get really expensive really fast. This set was an affordable option and works great. My only complaint is that when left to dry, they get really bad water spots. However, if you know this isn't your forever silverware set that you want to pass on to the grandchildren, this will work just great for you"
"The product seems a good value, but the picture is deceptive because it shows serving utensils. The product DOES NOT include serving utensils so let the buyer beware."
"Was hoping to get a great value, but got exactly what I paid for. This feels like cheap dollar store flatware. The edges feel like they were stamped out of sheet metal and not polished or finished at all. This will be going into the camper for occasional use and don‚Äôt care if it gets lost. I would not set my table at home with this low quality ware."
Much smaller than expected and very thin.. but it wasn't expensive so.....
This is good set silver wear as long as your not trying to impress anyone
Nice and sharp but the handle broke
Just a little bulky for the big spoon and forks but I‚Äôm going to keep them as my first starter set.
3 stars because this has no dessert spoons or small forks!!
Has held up thru daily dishwasher washings & oh so pretty! Very quality for the price point.
Love the sleek look of these. They aren‚Äôt very heavy but heavy enough to feel like quality. Which they are. They don‚Äôt rust and I get compliments on them all the time
"Was looking for a sturdy, attractive set of flatware to use daily. Product more than met my expectations. It is heavy enough to be durable without being cumbersome. This is the first time I have purchased black flatware, but I actually quite pleased with the appearance."
"The satin finish adds to their beauty. They are sturdy, feel comfortable in your hand. An elegant addition to even your everyday place settings."
Great product love them
"Pierden el color, al secarlos el pa√±o queda dorado"
"I‚Äôve wanted to change up my existing silverware with a pretty rose gold and thought this would be great. After only a week of using the silverware and running it through the dishwasher, the rose gold is already coming off! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting this and I wish I could send it back but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs too late :("
Disappointed in lack of quality control. This set did not match others I purchased. Returning.
This stainless steel 24 piece rose gold flatware set is beautiful and durable.  The price is reasonable and they look fancy. They are dishwasher safe. We are happy with them.
"Love how this set gives you so many utensils. Very durable and sturdy enough to pick up basically all foods. These utensils also do not leave that much of a metallic taste when eating food as well. They are however a little heavy to hold, but I kind of like the weight. Love the variety of these utensils."
Dont waste your money. The rose gold comes off after 3 washes. I loved these up until that point.
Loved it
"I love this, the way they look is just really nice. I needed some extra silverware. I liked it because it wasn‚Äôt expensive and I wasn‚Äôt concerned about it matching my already existing silverware. Seems to be very sturdy and worth the money. I was able to match this with my knife set though. Which looks really nice.  The different sizes are useful but not a big deal.  The one issue I see is that the surface in between the fork teeth is not smooth. The quality of them is bit rough and makes it look like they didn't smooth the surface."
So beautiful. Handwash.
Se va cayendo lo negro....
Very heavy well made. It's a very simple design but very elegant. Love the sizes and how many you get for the price is amazing!!
"This silverware is awesome! I bought a set of it about 4 years ago and somehow my kids have lost all but 3 of the forks and spoons, so I finally ordered another set. Every piece has held up very well to my crazy family. I hadn't two special needs children who are very hard on everything, but I've never had a problem. And what I love most of that 4 years after my original purchase I was still about to purchase the exact same pattern/design, so all my silverware still match. You can't even tell the difference between what is new and what is 4 years old. It all looks exactly the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Needed new flatware for multiple people. The weight is better than expected and the handles on each piece are designed well for handling.
These were so nice. Arrived insanely fast. The only thing that I would have liked more is for the spoons to be smaller. They are so big. I find this a lot in sets and wish they would include smaller spoons. Why do people need such giant spoons to eat with? Odd but otherwise very nice.
These are very good quality. I was worried due to the price. The are thick and string and size is average to me. They don‚Äôt look fake like some poor quality silver does. If you need silverware get these! You won‚Äôt regret it.
"This silverware set at first was strange as it came in a small rectangle box, but the material is sturdy and very beautiful."
The stainless set arrived in a timely manner. It was in perfect condition and looks beautiful.
The silverware are very durable and a great price.
"Bought this set for my daughter because she didn't have much silverware. But, she loves it and it was a great price for the amount of pieces. It was a wonderful value."
Vale la pena comprarla
The spoons are really large. It‚Äôs like large and larger. They are easy to clean. Overall I think it‚Äôs a great deal for the amount of utensils you get
Very good quality & pretty.
This silverware is worth the price. It is very study for being on the low end of pricing. The only slight downfall is this silverware is big. I would buy this again for sure
Good for the price . Packaged well. Will use for a few years .
plain but very sturdy and reasonable
Loved the pieces & look
I do recommend this set
Value for the money
Definitely worth the money! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great price
Very sturdy
"I don‚Äôt know why know one else mentions it but these are the biggest silverware I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Bought for our RV. The big spoons are the size of my serving spoons in my house. I guess if you like big silverware, these would be great but I returned for something more normal sized."
This a great set for our camper. 10 servings is amazing. Only thing I would change is the size difference between the spoons. Both are fairly big
"They look a little cheap, but seem to be sturdy enough for every day use. My nice silverware set has slowly disappeared. Hence this cheaper set."
I brought this set because it had so many pieces of silverware for a great price. I should have looked at the measurements. The silverware does not fit in my drawer organizer and all of the spoons are way too large. The bigger forks are also too long. I will be returning to purchase smaller silverware.
I thought I was ordering the same ones as I‚Äôd bought before. These are much thinner and feel much cheaper than I was hoping.
"Look good, hold up in dishwasher just not sturdy at all."
"The strength of the silverware is great, very hard to bend, nice big spoons and forks. The problem though, is they are not all that comfortable to hold. Kind of too narrow towards the top which brings a weird imbalance to them that I didn't like. I do like the bigger spoons and forks for things link stirring when I am cooking and for dishing out sides. I'd say these are more like serving silverware then they are eating utensils. Don't get me wrong, I like them alot for the way you can like say.. scoop up a big serving of mashed potatoes and a nice scoop of a side pasta or something like that, but I guess I just prefer my usual set of silverware here at the house for eating with. No complaints about the butter knives though."
"We got this full silverware set to use since it seems we're always running out of the silverware we already have and our other silverware is a bit older also. Our kids have been using more silverware and losing it all over the place too so we decided to get another set of extra silverware to use. This is nice looking, handy, and useful to have around. They're pretty sturdy, decent, and nice quality knives, forks, and spoons. It has salad/dinner forks and soup/serving spoons and knives. They are pretty easy to clean and send through the dishwasher as well."
"I got these because we needed silverware for our RV. I love them! They are nicely weighted and feel good in the hand. This is a sign of a nice set of silverware. They don't feel cheap, no sharp edges left from molds. They are smooth, comfortable to hold, and stainless! They stay looking great without having to clean like silver. When the time comes I would replace my household silverware with this set. It's simple design is exactly what my minimalist self loves!"
"After decades of using the silverware my mother got me back when I was in college (and of course losing pieces over the years), it was definitely time for a new set.  This silverware set is very pretty. My daughter commented on how ‚Äúshiny‚Äù it is. But the individual pieces are huge. The large spoons, for example, are so big that they will not fit into the correct spot in my standard silverware tray. I can't see any of us eating with them, but they'll be great as serving spoons - seriously. The small spoons are so large that when I eat my cereal with them, it feels the same as eating with the large spoon from my original set. Similarly, we will only be using the small forks. And while we use the knives for spreading peanut butter and such, we wouldn't use them to eat with. Then again, we're vegetarian, so we're all about Forks Over Knives, anyway!"
"We are helping our granddaughter set up her new apartment and were happy to find 40 Piece Stainlesss Steel Silverware Set for 8, Mirror Finish Basic Flatware Cutlery Set on Amazon. These pieces have a nice weight to them and are attractive. They wash well but will show spots if you don't allow them to dry well in the machine or dry them by hand. These are shinier than other sets I have seen, but it gives them a modern look. I like that there are 8 of each....very functional."
I'm very satisfied with this silverware set. I was looking for a set with teaspoons and tablespoons and this set has a lot of each. They stay shiny after lots of washes in the dishwasher and I'm sure will last me a very long time.
"Definitely has a mirror finish and that is it for decoration. These are a very simple plain set which is fine by me. I love the smaller forks that come in the set, something I actually have never had so a nice addition. These would be great as a gift for a college student or a first apartment. If you are looking for fancy and embellished then these are not for you."
I bought these as a gift for a male friend who desperately needed flatware. He loved them! They are perfect for a man. Large and heavy.
"These are a nice weight, nicely made, and their smooth finish makes them a nice complement for any dinnerware. We got the polished version and they look great!"
"Simple set of flatware. I think it is a good price point, especially if you needed to buy several sets for a large gathering."
"We got these for a vacation home. They are actually pretty nice, nothing fancy and the price is right."
Great quality
"My previously owned Oneida stainless steel over the years became a victim of many life changes. So, I had a flatware deficit!! Since my days of after college and single life, I had been a user of Oneida stainless. In my mind that's all there is! Of course, times sadly have changed not always for the best. I had much difficulty finding stainless steel that I would even consider for my use. Mind you, I live alone now. My days of ""entertaining"" have with mixed feelings passed. But, I still insisted in my mind on Oneida flatware for everyday! I wanted more than 4 place settings, but no more than 6. The days of needing 12 places with every imaginable hostess and serving pieces long gone. Wanted it to feel substantial in my hand. Oh. And I wanted quality for my money! I know....picky! Picky! It truly is difficult shopping online. In smaller and mid-size towns our choices are more limited. So, after much studying descriptions, specifications and reviews I made my decision. And I am very pleased! The 8 place setting of Oneida Lincoln pattern stainless steel is what I was searching for. And I am most satisfied! I originally wanted 6 place setting, but 8 isn't overkill. The hostess set is useful, along with other pieces already in my posession. Eventually I may even add a few additional soup spoons. Even though I live alone, I use those the most. And a few iced tea spoons. It will be interesting to find other patterns of those pieces to coordinate with my Lincoln pattern. I'm enjoying not having matching everything in this new world. And am embracing it. Even my dishes and accessory pieces! No problems with rusting or dullness. They shine and are bright! I wash in dishwasher. Even after drying cycle I wipe with a soft cloth (also Amazon finds) as well as my dishes, etc. I like the sharp tines of the forks, as I did search for ones that would pierce food easily. Not ones that tend to be ""squared"" at the ends. I zoomed in on every feature during my search! If a friend was to be searching for new Stainless flatware, I could and would make this a recommendation!"
"I researched and searched, bought a set from another brand, returned it. Went back to Oneida, read the reviews on this set, took a chance, and couldn't stop the happiness at the look and feel of this beautiful flatware set as I opened the box! I researched for a heavy weight flatware to replace the set we got over 10 years ago; unfortunately Oneida discontinued that pattern. This modern, sleek, classy pattern is a great replacement, it's even better. We love the sleek, curvy, smooth style, and mostly it is the weight we wanted. To help others, I am going to include the weight, using my food scale, which I would have loved to have when shopping around. To give you an idea, the knife is 4.2 oz., the soup spoon is 1.8 oz., the salad fork is 1.7, dinner fork, 2.3 and the teaspoons is 1.5 ounces. I just ordered the 2nd set of these, and should last us for a long time! Oneida does it again! I highly recommend this pattern. Sometimes, happiness can come in a nice, classy box of Oneida, heavyweight, aesthetically pleasing flatware! :-)"
"I love this flatware set. I have had it for 14 years. I like the quality of it as well as the size of the utensils, i.e. the spoons aren't too big or too flat. It was difficult to find a replacement for this set. I needed to add additional flatware. The Oneida site did not have it. I was glad to find it on Amazon. The item arrives in a timely manner and in a perfect box."
"I purchased these nearly a year ago, they receive pretty harsh wear-and-tear daily and are holding up VERY well. The first couple months or so I sort of babied these things...made sure never to leave them sitting in water in the sink, etc. However, after the newness of them wore off I became quite complacent and started being rather abusive to them....and i must say; not a single one has stained or is showing any unusual signs of wear (maybe a little loss of luster...but it's highly minimal if any).  In case it matters: I do machine wash these and use Finish quantum dishwasher pods; maybe they wouldn't hold up so well if you use a cheaper detergent...I honestly do not know...I've never used anything else.  Usability: This set is relatively thick and heavy...I personally LOVE that, however I can easily see why someone may not like having a heavy set of cutlery. The handles on the pieces are wide enough that they are easy to hold and rest well in the hand. The knives in particular have a wider handle that feels excellent when in use.  TL;DR: After a year, they are holding up really well and still look new even after some pretty careless abuse (leaving them in water, etc.). I'm thinking about ordering a second set in a couple months as I will be moving in with my partner and would rather not run the dishwasher daily to keep up with keeping clean dishes for 2 people. Highly, highly recommended."
"Really like the set. Looks great, feels really good when holding the utensil. There are some minor scuffs already after few months , so i recommend not using the scrubbing side of the sponge. I just got the non-scratch Scrub Dots Scotch-Brite sponge, so i think the scuffing will stop."
Found the match to my silverware for day use. I was very excited as I couldn‚Äôt find it in stores. Product is perfect for sturdy and very becoming.
"A beautiful design in a quality execution. A hefty stainless steel. I liked this so much, I bought a second set to enjoy daily."
"Oh wow, these are more beautiful than the picture hands down!! I have had my original Oneida from our wedding and that was 26 years ago. They really held up, now they are going to my son and his new wife."
Did not think I was going to like but they have worked out great. So far they wash up nice and really have comfortable feel.
"Really good set. I got the first set I have from HEB, a local chain in Texas, and was looking for the match to expand it out. The set is really nice, has a good shine that hasn't tarnished over the four months of use so far from the original purchase. The pieces do have a bit of heft to them, I wouldn't call them petite dinnerware but fine for a family set. Nothing wrong so far, meets all expectations I had for my first set of household silverware."
Very nice piece of silverware to own I ordered three more boxes of the 20 piece Has a good weight The Lincoln has a very clean look to them
"This is a beautiful set for a first kitchen set. After 6 months, no issues and cleans up excellent using Cascade with bleach in the washer. I use a water softener so I don't get any spots, it is always shiny and clean. Good weight and great sizes."
This set is fantastic. We are on our 3rd set in 8 years and we still love it. And the only reason we're on our 3rd set is because somehow silverware goes missing with children. Nothing to do with quality though. It is elegant and sturdy and my absolute favorite silverware.
"Bought my third set from Amazon. For some reason my forks disappear. I love this set; feels heavier in the hands, nice sheen and overall quality. Would highly recommend."
I've owned the Lincoln collection for over 5 years and I couldn't be happier with the product. They are well balanced and feel good in your hands. I recently purchased an additional 20 piece set to supplement my original set. You can barely tell the old from the new. Highly recommended. Modern design with a very classic appeal.
Beautiful
"I have purchased Onieda silverware several times over the past 40 years. This is the first time I have ever had even one piece to rust. It appears this whole set is slowly rusting away .I purchased the last set on June 30, 2021. It was the Lincoln 45 piece set. At first I thought it was my dishwasher. This is a brand new Samsung Dishwasher purchased on Jue 30, 2021 . I had no idea what was causing the rust. My time to return has run. I hope this was a one time error."
"I'm super picky with utensils. I've found that lately, many/most manufacturers are producing utensils that are GIGANTIC! I don't want to eat soup out of a serving spoon, thanks. So I read review after review and found this set. When it arrived, I saw that the proportions were exactly what I wanted, along with having a nice, sleek design that would look nice in both casual and elegant dinner settings. So far, they're durable and pretty and for the price, a total steal."
"This is a good product However , I received only 8 teaspoons not 12. No way to contact the seller . And 15 tablespoons"
"This set is elegantly simple. Replaced our 32 year old Oneida set with another and it has been praised by all. Heavier and sturdier, so it takes up more space in the tray, but a set to be proud of. Very eye catching for it‚Äôs understated elegance."
I bought this for my Dad's Christmas gift and he loves it. He was looking for some flatware with spoons that won't bend when you're digging out ice cream. This flatware is heavy duty and elegant looking. I'm thinking of buying me and my husband some of this.
"I had originally bought this set from Kohl's but they no longer carried it, and I found this set to be comparably priced and just as good as the ones I bought from Kohls. They are a hefty, solid set. I don't like for a spoon to bend when I scoop ice cream. This is the best set I've ever used."
"Wonderful flatware set. Feels well balanced in the hand. I have one set of this pattern that is 5 yr old, and this one is filling out the current set. No complaints."
Every day use.
"I love my silverware set! It is very durable without being big, heavy and clunky!"
Got these to repllace our old and mismatched flatware. The weight and feel of these is awesome. The grip has the feel of the new Cuisinart pan hangles. Extremely pleased.
It is a good weight and comfortable in the hand.
We needed some nice silverware for a vacation home and this is perfect. It's durable and holds up well yet looks good and doesn't feel cheap.
This replaced a 30 year old Oneida set with missing pieces. Very nice finish and 'heavy' duty. They will destroy your garbage disposal (joke). I'm very pleased with them.
A very nice design and well made. Should keep its good looks for many years.
"Great heavy duty flatware. I purchased a set locally and liked it so much, I had to have another set. We entertain family quite often and needed more than a service of 8."
Passed the wife's standards.
Great As described
I really like this set of Oneida Silverware. It is heavy duty and looks great. Great buy for the price!
"Very nice and sturdy set. The spoons are the perfect size, compared to other sets."
Perfect addition to the set I already had
Perfect replacements for missing utensils
Good flatware. Great price. Exactly what i wanted and it is good Oneida quality.
"Finally decided to buy grown-up flatware and let the plastic handle crap go (despite the pretty blue). Appears very durable. Nice weight and beautiful shine. Even though they are stainless steel, I took the time to read the care instructionss and learned to wipe or rinse food off before going into the dishwasher."
"I got this set with the Set for 8 as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It has an excellent weight; there will be no bending of spoons here. The set for 8 comes with 1 serving spoon and 1 slotted serving spoon and 1 meat fork. The set for 4 doesn't have any serving pieces. The pattern is simple enough to be casual and pretty enough to be used on a more formal table. I will probably get another set for my 2nd daughter, and maybe a set for myself."
"Nice and solid, just as advertised. The tablespoons are smaller than I am used to, but that is probably just me. We are very happy with the purchase."
"I already had one 45-piece set of this flatware, but with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up I decided to order another one. I've had the first set for almost a year and I love the look and weight of them!"
"I bought three of these sets for my wife for Christmas and she is very happy with them. the finish is excellent and they have a sturdy well made feel to them. As someone mentioned they might be heavier than other sets, but we think they are comfortable to use and have a feel of being a high quality product (If you know tools they kind of remind me as being the ""Snap-on"" of stainless dinnerware).  So far they have made it through the dishwasher just fine and we have not seen any finish problems..  We did have one spoon that had a manufacturing defect and we contacted Oneida about it. They then referred us to their retail distribution company. We contacted the second company and they said they did not deal with the Amazon seller and they referred us back to Oneida (with Oneida cc'd on the e-mail). I had the feeling it was going to go nowhere. But... much to my surprise, Oneida got right back to me (without my having to contact them), apologized for the inconvenience and told me they would replace the spoon with a set of four spoons. They also sent us several other additional pieces to make up for the confusion.  Overall, we are really happy with our dealings with, and the product from Oneida."
This set of Oneida Silverware is exactly as listed. It is a good heavy stainless. I already had one set and needed another to make a service for 16.
"So much flatware these days seems to be made thinner and lighter than one would expect, as if the manufacturer is trying to minimize the amount of steel used. I‚Äôve bought a number of sets that have an aesthetic I like, but feel and look cheap when you hold them in your hand and examine them closely. Oneida‚Äôs Lincoln flatware is a welcome exception. Every piece has a nice weight to it. It remains to be seen how well it holds up in the dishwasher, but immediately out of the box, it‚Äôs gorgeous. I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase."
"I bought this for my wife because it was Wood or Silverware for our 5th anniversary. Even though it's 2021 and I'm the family cook, do the laundry etc.....she loved this set. We had a good chuckle at ""old world"" traditions and greatly appreciate the quality of this silverware set. I will probably buy a 2nd set because someone (not me) has an issue losing spoons at work. I accept that, though, because you can always replace silverware, but not yours pretty wife........Oneida, please do not discontinue this set!!!  A++++ AWESOME!!!!"
"You can‚Äôt go wrong with Oneida! It‚Äôs the brand I trust and used my entire life. Very pleased with the quality of this set. I purchased based on the reviews of others who had bought it and was not disappointed. We bought it as a gift for our daughter who recently got her own place to live. She was using yard sale stuff, so this was a nice quality gift she was happy to receive. It easily looks like quality silverware that cost twice as much. I would definitely buy again!"
Very nice set and a reasonable price.
"Very nice set of silverware, I already owned an eight piece set and wanted to make a service for twelve. I don't think you can go wrong with any of Oneida's flatware sets. The price was right with Amazon and delivery was fast."
"Solid feel in your hand, will last many years. Great buy, My friends are now looking for a new set."
"I took time to find a set which was both well known, durable, would be available for a long time, and, most importantly, is easy on the hands to hold and use.  In the short time I've had this set, I can share that it is very comfortable to use. The pieces are well balanced, easy on the hands, while you ""know"" you have a good utensil in your hands. My mother is 80 y/o and finds this set easy to use (unlike previous flatware I've owned).  I initially purchased service for 8 and have now increased to service for 12 because I'll invariably lose one or two along the way (typical guy thing.. haha )"
I love the silverware it was very thing I expected. I did receive the silverware on the day it was due.
Perfect
"This is our second set of the Lincoln Oneide Flatware. We have had the first for over 6 years and just wanted another set so we don't run out when we have company. It's a sturdy, nice-looking set, and we haven't noticed any kind of rusting. The fork and spoon sizes are great. My toddlers can use the smaller sizes, and the bigger ones aren't too big. I love this set!"
Perfect
These are hefty yet feel good in your hand.
"You need to know this about ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù: The only difference between a box of ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù and a box of ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù is a peelable UPC label, but ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù is typically priced 25% less. As long as ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù is available, you should buy that instead.  How is this possible, you ask?  Well, Oneida sells ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù under a contractual agreement with its authorized dealers to not sell it than for less than a set minimum price. It does not matter if the authorized dealer is selling on the internet or in a physical store. They simply cannot underprice below the minimum if they don‚Äôt want to violate the terms of their Oneida contract. To sell ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù cheaper through lower-end outlets like Sears, Oneida labeled some of the same boxes as ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù to avoid undercutting their higher-end authorized dealers who were selling ‚ÄúLincoln.‚Äù (This happens all the time in retail, so don‚Äôt be amazed.)  Sears subsequently discontinued ‚ÄúLinden,‚Äù and vendors across the internet bought the inventory. Some vendors still sell ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù at the full price (because they have to), and at the same time they sell ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù for 25% less, but they will actually ship the same box in either case, because the content of the boxes is identical.  Therefore, my advice is that you do a search for ‚ÄúOneida Linden,‚Äù first and order that for 25% less. Eventually, the surplus stock of ‚ÄúLinden‚Äù will be exhausted, and after that, my advice is to be a wary consumer of Oneida and other name-brand tableware because of such little branding and pricing games.  If you are still reading at this point, here another fascinating tidbit: Oneida has reduced the quality of ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù over the years to maintain a lower price-point. A decade ago, ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù was a much heavier 18/10 (18% chromium and 10% corrosion-resistant nickel) stainless steel, but they have since cheapened it to be a much thinner and lighter 18/0 steel; I have both before and after the change, and while they look so similar you can‚Äôt tell at first, if you hold a fork of each in your hands, the new version is obviously lighter and more cheaply made. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Oneida is still a quality brand, but it is sad to see how they have let the quality fall over time. A bit of tarnish on Oneida‚Äôs reputation, just like their stainless steel is more likely to tarnish these days‚Ä¶"
I just opened my silverware because I just moved into my place. Although it looks very pretty.. I used this knife once and the bottom is all black and pitted.. several pieces are stained or have marks that don‚Äôt come off.They were hand washed.. I deserve a new set
Omg! I was nervous to buy silverware on line but thought I'd take the chance. I'm so glad I did. I love this set! So heavy and sturdy. Beautiful design! I am thrilled I took the chance. You won't be disappointed.
We have been using for about two months and the knives have completely rusted out - unbelievable. Oneida used to be a quality company. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT.
Very excited I found these at such a great price! I had another set before and needed more. These are great and I love the simple yet little flare of design on the ends. Very modern and will definitely buy again if I need more!!
"Rust on 2 knife handle. Can it be replaced?  This item was replaced because of rust on knife handle. It is doing the same thing, rust on knife handle. I would like to return and order a different set."
I ordered 2 sets of these based on the reviews. Several pieces have rusted in less than a month.
"I gave this as a gift to newlyweds for Christmas. I was pleased with the weight of the pieces, not flimsy."
"I bought these and washed them in the dishwasher. They are really shiny, which I was not expecting for some reason. They are a little too shiny for me and my first dishwasher left spots. The second one didn‚Äôt. I would not buy these again because of the sheen, but if you want something sturdy and shiny, this is a good buy. They are heavy and the quality is good."
I purchased the Oneida Lincoln set some years ago and found that I no longer had a complete set (probably from moving). After looking at several websites I found that Amazon offered the best price. They match with my old ones which were quite durable in looks and value for money. Would highly recommend.
"Heavy, balanced, simple lines. This set is quality that. Is worth the money."
"I love the look of this silverware, we got it for a gift 13 years ago and they still look brand new. I just bought another set (this one) and they are just as beautiful"
"Was happy when I first received my flatware, they were solid and as other reviewers noted...heavy. I enjoyed that they were shiney and made my old flatware look cheap. Anyway after a few washings, I noticed that some of the pieces were loosing their shine and it was quite apparent. No one seems to know how to bring back the shine, maybe it was just a factory finish that easily wears off, but very disapointing."
I bought the 45 piece Lincoln Oneida set and 4 knives and one table spoon have bad finishes. Theses were a Christmas gift and beyond the return policy and the company is making it difficult to replace asking for a return that didn‚Äôt come with the package. It‚Äôs very upsetting.
"You often see silver or gold flatware, but I feel it's rare to see this black set. It's stunning next to any flatware set. I've run it through the dishwasher multiple times and there is no discoloration. The steak knives are super sharp, great for cutting meat, or accidentally slicing fingers :( (user error) Great sturdy set, highly recommend."
Very nice looking looking when you get them but after a while the rust and tarnish wud I can return but can‚Äôt because of time frame.
"This set was very pretty, I did return them though from my own misreading. I thought they would be matte black. No fault of theirs though, super glossy and beautiful and annive heavy weight silverware"
"I was pleased with the quality of this utensil set. The finish looks really nice and it has a nice shine to it. All of the utensils are sturdy, and I was really impressed with the serrated knives. I‚Äôve only ran them through one or two dishwasher cycles at this point, but I‚Äôve not noticed any damage or fading, fingers crossed! But I think they are lovely and they were just what I was looking for for my kitchen."
I like the long thin look of these utensils. I also love you get steak knives with it. They are kind of weighted in the hand which I like. They are fancy and when they are cleaned they do not have spots dried on them. They are matted but have a flicker of sparkly bits in there. I like the length. My husband is a big guy and they do not look dainty in his hand. He also approves of these. I will probably buy another set. These would be good as a house warming gift. They're sexy :D trust me!
The handles seem a little longer than normal silverware. The whole set is good quality. Steak knives are very sharp. I believe because of the color you can see water spots but wipes off and has a good shine. I would buy another set. Worth the price
I did an inistal wash in the dish washer which is explicitly said to be safe in the description and all of the butter knives rusred right away. After a few more washes we started seeing it on the steak knives and then on a for here and there. Absolutely will not recommend to anyone. I will be replacing these as soon as possible. I have only had them for a month and half the set is rusted.
So far so good. They are beautiful. I always get complements. They are so much better than the traditional silver. Great buy.
Great silverware set.
I bought these right before Christmas because I‚Äôm changing all my things in my kitchen black and my mom loved them. I love they are dishwasher safe. Love the look. 100% recommend.
Love it‚Äôs a true black easy to hold
Great value
I wanted something black when we remodeled our house !! These are perfect !! Need to order more !! üòÇ
I‚Äôm very happy with this product and for the price!
"I really like these things. I like the way they are made, the way they look in the utensil drawer and how they look in use. Good purchase!"
Nice product
"It's good, nothing else to say. It's not exactly black though but very nice."
Didn't realize how much I would love this set of silverware
I love the look and they feel very sturdy in my hands. This was what my plate was missing!
Substantial flatware. Very happy
This BLACK Silverware Set is definitely one of my favorite gifts to myself. Stirling Silverware is old school. It was time for something new. I love it!!
They are absolutely perfect.
Great supplemental set. Inexpensive and sturdy.
Very nice and sturdy
"Needed new silverware, The weight is so light and the sheen on this set is Awesome."
Beautiful set that includes everything you need for everyone from a bachelor to a family of four
Elegant flatware that is a nice finishing touch to your dinner table.
"These are fabulous! They look elegant, feel nice and sturdy not cheap and best of all they‚Äôre dishwasher SAFE!!! Item was exactly as described and arrived earlier than expected."
I love this dinnerware set! I never thought I would say that dinnerware is elegant. It;s a great value.
They're just dope
This silverware is balanced. A slight bend near the handle gives comfort to use.
Very pretty!
"S√∫per lindos, muy bien empacados y muy resistentes Un producto sensacional"
"Love these black silverware. These work exceptionally in the kitchen, are sharp and preform great."
The smallest fork and spoon are smaller than expected but still a great set and I‚Äôve loved having it!
I love this set of silverware. Great quality and value. I will be ordering another set.
"Exactly as advertised, perfect weight, great quality"
Loved the silverware! Looks very modern.
I like the color match color plate set
Great product!! I love my new utensils set!!
Love love love
I like it product
"great set, love it"
I like the gloss it has and that it‚Äôs not a dull/dry black

"After 3 months if use, I got tired of pulling out utensils with damaged finish and bought a replacement. The seller claimed that these are dishwasher safe, but clearly they are not."
"I was skeptical at first, but very happy with this purchase.  If you are looking for a true black as listed, don't get this set. They are a dark gray/gun metal color which is why I took one star off. I actually like the color and don't mind. They are sturdy/heavy like normal stainless steel flatware and easy to clean. My favorite part are the steak knives which are hard to find in a set like this for more than 4 settings.  Exceeds expectations and totally worth the money!"
It's not really black like advertised. It's more of a dark gray. Other than that it's good
"Soooooo, ultimately I‚Äôm really in love. I bought these as an overall house gift for my home for Christmas. Right out of the box, I was very impressed. The matte black finish is to die for. Super elegant. There‚Äôs two sizes of spoons and forks, which is a must. In the reviews I had read that the steak knives rusted on other buyers, if left in the sink. I haven‚Äôt found that to be the case. No rust for us 3 months in of everyday use. The set has been run thru the dishwasher time and time again with virtually no issues. My only complaint overall is that some of the pieces have gotten dinged/scratched up. Now some of the pieces have silver showing thru where it‚Äôs scratched. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, and not noticeable unless inspecting the silverware. For the price, you get a good amount t of silverware that is beautiful, and sturdy for the most part. I love the product."
"As many of the other reviews have said, the product rusts after only one or two washes. I don‚Äôt know what the deal is, the temporary dollar store utensils I was using prior to this didn‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm really bummed."
Absolutely love this set BUT I ordered this one because there was supposed to be two different size forks. I only received ONE size fork and my missing smaller forks were replaced with double the amount of steak knives. I would have given 5 stars had I received the correct amount of everything pictured.
"I usually put my washed utensils on the drying rack. However, with this black kit, the surface is covered with visible water spots. So the utensil looks dirty when it is not. My solution now is to dry them by hand."
One of the pieces came chipped. I requested a new knife but was given a credit instead. I really like the looks of it. Tired of the stainless steel stuff.
This product said dishwasher safe! Bought on July 11th and my steak knives are rusting!! Very disappointing. Such pretty dinnerware yet so disappointing. So sad.
"I love the color, but they run on the small side. Maybe they're supposed to. I was a little surprised by it."
Not too shabby‚Ä¶ the steak knives aren‚Äôt the best though
"They are very light, look nice.  Even they are light but they hurt my palm since their handle ends are little bit sharp.  Not recommend!"
Even after hand washing; I have to completely dry and polish them
"Really liked these when I ordered them. They are very light weight however they are not sturdy. The fork pieces bend when cutting meat and holding it with the fork, and they dont last if you use the dishwasher. The coating comes off and then they rust. no bueno."
The duality is not what I expected for the money. The metal is cheap and bendable on forks. Does look like a matte black and just looks very cheap. The knifes almost feel like plastic knives like disposable knives. I‚Äôm returning item because I don‚Äôt even want to deal with owning these. The only reason it gets as high as two stars from me is because they didn‚Äôt break.
I hand wash these and dry them as soon as they are clean. Started rusting. Where's the warranty??
I‚Äôm not a fan of these. The forks are actually sharp and poke me. The finish on them easily rubs off. I also just personally don‚Äôt like the way they feel. The big spoons feel to big and the little spoons are to little. I wish there was an in between. I have literally gone back to my cheap Walmart silverware because I just don‚Äôt like these.
I liked it until we ised them
I received my order today and got steak knives and butter knives only. No forks or spoons!
I love these but the black on them is starting to come off after a couple months.
"Felt like these could be easily bent. Also spoons had very minimal depth on the curvature of the spoon so I think if you were eating something with a more liquid consistency it would not be easy to eat with. But they do look very nice, and this was a great value, just not sure they would hold up well over time so we returned before use."
"Good quality so far (I‚Äôve only hand washed) but I expected a more matte black, it‚Äôs a glossy dark gray."
"Spoons are small, very light weight."
The forks and spoons are great! The knives rusted in the dishwasher.
"Color coming off and rusting already, less than 3 months"
"This set is very basic, which is what I wanted. Exactly as described. I read reviews saying the steak knives rusted after one wash so I was worried. I have washed them numerous times and there is absolutely no sign of rust. Happy with my purchase!"
My wife and I were surprised by the quality of this set The price we paid for this set is fair and worth the money. We bought these for our camper.
"I need more flatware and saw these and thought, why not for the price. I love them, sturdy, stylish and for what I paid a huge steal. They are now my daily flatware."
Very nice set of stainless steel.
"Can not beat this set for the price! The size/proportions are perfect, they have a nice smooth finish and they are well made. I've bought a similar price set at Walmart before that didn't even come with steak knives and it was junk so I didn't have the highest expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these actually are, especially the steak knives."
Just the right size flatware for a wonderful thanksgiving meal. My grandchildren didn‚Äôt have a problem with them and my fingers can hold them well with my arthritis.
I love this silverware set. It‚Äôs extremely shiny and I love having an extra amount of forks. The knives are very sharp. I‚Äôve washed them multiple times and haven‚Äôt seen any rust (mentioned in other reviews). It‚Äôs perfect for a new home.
"You can NOT go wrong buying this silverware!! It is SO worth the money. Usually it's true that you get what you pay for, but I am telling you, this set is worth EVERY penny spent!!"
The silverware is solid and of good quality! Very good value. Buy today!
"This silverware set is immaculate. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre medium weighted, good length and just overall great. Those steak knives are SHARP. I opened a pack of hotdogs like I was slicing through water. I don‚Äôt think one would be disappointed buying this set."
"These are attractive, smooth, sturdy, and has some weight to them. Totally worth the price."
Overall just as expected. Good quality silverware at a decent price point. Recommend.
"Just moved to a new home and this silverware set was better that I anticipated. They are very sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, and just what my new kitchen needed to complete ‚Äúthe look‚Äù I was going for."
Super fast shipping! Great product with all the pieces that I need for when my daughter moves out on her own.
The silverware are thick enough to use and ware well.
Ordered it for my camper great sec great price .
Great set for the price!
Amazing! Just as described! Great quality for the price. I will probably order another set or two to use at work sites!
"This is an awesome set, for the money even better."
very good price good reviews
"Excellent product for the money! Strong, sturdy silverware perfect for starting a home with."
Very good value and quality for the money
Such a great value for the price. All of the silverware has helped significantly with cooking and place setting.
Nice simple very happy
Great product for the dollar anount
"Looks luxurious! Husband wouldn‚Äôt believe the price, that‚Äôs how you know it was a good purchase."
Just what we needed. Fantastic.!!!
"Very nice set of silverware. It has a good weight, nice polish and easy to clean."
Much better than I had anticipated. heavier and the steak knifes will cut anything...so far :) I would recommend for anyone
Better than I expected! Especially for the price! Sturdy and strong silverware. Would order again.

Very good

Exactly what I ordered
This was a great value. Very happy with this purchase. Super fast shipping as well.
This is a great set but be careful with the steak knives...they are extremely sharp. Great for cutting but dangerous when hand washing.. accidentally cut myself ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ.
Everything is great except for the knives. The knives are just trash. Don't even bother
Not the best quality of steel. Useful if you don‚Äôt have anything else but not good for a fancy or formal dinner.
Sturdy and strong. You get a great product for your money
It‚Äôs sturdy silverware but does have some sharp edges on the spoons and stuff. I noticed that a few of them started to get rust spots when I let them dry naturally. I don‚Äôt have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash everything. We do have well water with a water softener system but the other silverware in the house didn‚Äôt rust. Overall it‚Äôs not a terrible deal for what it is. I would buy it again if in a pinch.
The silverware fits my needs
The box was busted open silverware was scratched. Very disappointed.in this order. Make it right..m
These are perfect for my home... They don't bend easy and serve their purpose
The item was exactly as described and a great deal for the price I paid.
"I really think these are great! Lots of silver ware for a great price! The steak knives are really nice. The large spoons are overly large, more like serving spoons. But all in all...Very pleased!"
Cheap material. Steak knives aren‚Äôt even sharp. Very disappointed.
I would've love to give this silverware 5 stars but most of them are not polished correctly and the edges are a bit sharp. Hopefully you'll get a set that is properly polished.
There is no way that this cutlery is what is described in the listing. It all rusted after the FIRST wash. We have silverware from IKEA that at least took years to rust. Pretty sure this is the lowest quality possible.  I am returning both sets of these immediately.
Son de muy buen material est√°n muy bien
These silverware set is nice.
Love my new silverware. Perfect weight and strudy. Easy clean and sleek look.
"I recently moved into my very first apartment on my own. As a lot of people know, it can get really expensive really fast. This set was an affordable option and works great. My only complaint is that when left to dry, they get really bad water spots. However, if you know this isn't your forever silverware set that you want to pass on to the grandchildren, this will work just great for you"
"The product seems a good value, but the picture is deceptive because it shows serving utensils. The product DOES NOT include serving utensils so let the buyer beware."
"Was hoping to get a great value, but got exactly what I paid for. This feels like cheap dollar store flatware. The edges feel like they were stamped out of sheet metal and not polished or finished at all. This will be going into the camper for occasional use and don‚Äôt care if it gets lost. I would not set my table at home with this low quality ware."
Much smaller than expected and very thin.. but it wasn't expensive so.....
This is good set silver wear as long as your not trying to impress anyone
Nice and sharp but the handle broke
Just a little bulky for the big spoon and forks but I‚Äôm going to keep them as my first starter set.
3 stars because this has no dessert spoons or small forks!!
Love this set! We have company over and my 20 price set wasn‚Äôt cutting it. I‚Äôve run these through the dishwasher about 30 times since I‚Äôve had them and they are holding up nicely no scratches like my other set
These are such great value for their price. They work well and I haven‚Äôt experienced any rusting or weird edges. I would definitely buy these again!
So for the price and how much you get they are great. It‚Äôs what made me want to buy them. But they arrived scratched and although it‚Äôs not the biggest deal but it does make them look cheap if you really pay attention. This is just out of the box so I‚Äôm worried about how much they will scratch after using them in general. But if you‚Äôre looking for cheap silverware they are still usable out the box.
A pretty nice and value for the money you spend these are fairly good quality for the price I was expecting them to band easy but they hold their shape they're really a good deal
You get what you pay for. Need a bunch of new silverware go for it don't have to worry about kids messing up these ones. Kids keep bending spoons on ice cream.
"I was doubtful for the price. Wonderful bright, shiny, Nice balance and weight! so far I have sold another on it. My teens each ""barrowed"" from my old silver it was past time to get a new set. Truly love them even after using them a bit!"
I had the cheap Walmart silverware that rusts and plastic silverware until I saw the price of this was basically the same as the cheap Walmart silverware. In the past I paid over 5xs more for less pieces. And as it is stainless steel it shouldn't rust.
So very pleased with this product! Very good quality! Would definitely buy again!
"This product exceeded my expectations. Quality, durability, dishwasher safe."
Good for everyday use. The utensils have some weight which is nice and they are finished off well.
Good set with good weight to each piece and sleek design. They work well and are a fraction of the cost for what you get compared to other utensils.
Love this product. Use them everyday. Wish I had known about them sooner. Definitely recommendable.
I chose these because of the smooth transition from the handle to the blade or to the tines or to the bowl of the spoon. It is so much easier to keep these clean than those that have sharp corner or edge there.
Wanted a set for my RV works great uniform feel well made
Awesome value for the price. We are a family of 5 so we need a lot of quality pieces that didn‚Äôt break the budget. This works perfect.
"Great price and best price I might add that I could find in stores and on Amazon, perfect number and set!"
Very beautiful will surely will recommend it
Great deal for the price
Great
I told you I liked it.
This silverware was great for the price! Do not seem cheap at all. They are very sturdy!
I like the size
A good purchase its value is awesome
"Nice weight, easy to hold,"
Very sturdy set. Looks great.
These utensils are sturdy and of great quality. Very happy with purchase.
Great quality.
Love them!
Pleasantly surprised at the quality!
Loved them as soon as I pulled out of box. Light weight. Simplistic.
Light but sturdy flatware. Great for travel and outdoor use rather tan plastic flatware.
These are a little bigger than my others but very nice quality and lots of pieces. Seems like we keep losing forks so i hope we dont lose these. lol
Everything is as expected
Good value for the money. Needed an extra set because with kids in the house my utensils kept disappearing üôÖ. So far sturdy and good quality. Very happy with this purchase.
Good quality for the price
Good value
"Sturdy, worth the cost, simple design"
"This silverware I b have ordered is for everyday use. Very, very sarisfied with quality.  Thank you Barbara Cotter"
Very good just as indicated
Look good
"Great set, great price, much nicer than expected."
"This set is a keeper!!! Nice and heavy, so comfortable and smooth. Might just have to buy another ‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£"
The silverware set is excellent especially for the money. It is nice and bright. Sturdy and the structure is easily held with hands.
They lasted so far and I'm happy.
"This set is beautiful & high quality. A great value, exactly what I needed!"
I like that they
Balanced and comfortable to hold
I absolutely liked the product.
Fast and perfect for what I need
Very good quality
Great pieces well made for the price
Good silverware at a good price
Love the quality for a low price.
I recommend this product at 100%
Great price sturdy and enough for the whole family.
Solid set for the price. There is not a huge difference between the size of the small and big spoons. The small spoons are definitely not teaspoons. Not a big deal though.
"Rusted the very first time it was run through the dishwasher! I have included a couple photos, but these are not the only pieces that rusted - many more did as well. I am extremely dissappointed."
"Very nice flatware. Surdy, nice finsh and appropriate size. I knocked down one star category due to incorrect order. Too many small forks and not the right amount of small spoons. Amazon had this corrected right away and order is complete. Make sure you count all pieces when they arrive."
Got them for a wedding gift
Very nice set and not pricey.
"Great product, great price! They feel very expensive, and don‚Äôt tarnish!"
"I loved these spoons, very sturdy (they do not bend) and so many for a great price!"
Wasn't great quality
Very please with the quality and value of this silverware.
These appear to be solid pieces of flatware. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Each piece came in an individual plastic sleeve. A pain to unpack and wasteful.
"The item itself is pretty good, looks as is advertised in the picture and they all come individually wrapped which is good because it avoids scratches during shipment but the package to the item was poor and before I even opened the box they were spilling out of its original package into the shipping box. Too many heavy items for such flimsy original packaging. Other than that though the item itself is good and is as advertised."
"This set is super original which I loved. However, after only a few months, it‚Äôs already rusted on half the pieces. Most of the spoons are rusted and a lot of forks in between the spikes. Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get ahold of the seller. But super sad. I won‚Äôt be purchasing again or suggest it to others due to what happened with my set."
The flatware in this set seems to be made of poor quality. A number of pieces are tarnished when simply opening the package and they will not shine. VERY DISAPPOINTED  We returned this set and ordered another.  John J Hogan
"These are a value for the money. A little light for my taste, I like a little heavier"
The quality of this product is good for the price. However the large spoons and small spoons have the same size bowl. It may have said that in the description but I was used to a smaller spoon having a smaller bowl so I was disappointed in that manner.
"This is a pretty nice set of silverware for the money. I was looking for a set of daily use silverware. It is well balanced. Yet, Forks are roughly finished at tines, and 5 out of 60 pcs (8%) were harshly scratched and poorly moulded leaving small holes on the surface. It was hard to take clear pictures because of reflection though. I was kinda disappointed because this set has an almost 5-star rating and even came with a customer service information card which says ""SATISFACTION GUARANTEE"" (yes without ""D"") with 3 steps to claim. The product page says to contact the seller directly for service, but this information on the card would just redirect me to Amazon customer service to return. I would not return just to get these 5 pcs replaced while there is no guarantee that I would receive a perfect set anyway. I am just leaving this review to let people know there is no such customer service to expect from the seller and also for any future buyers not to expect a perfect set of silverware."
"I absolutely love this silverware set and am ordering my second one (enough for family dinners and such). It‚Äôs the perfect size, sturdy enough to know it‚Äôs good quality but not overly clunky and heavy. Amazing quality. Would recommend 100%! Arrived 2 weeks before the projected delivery date as well."
"I have only had this flatware for a few days , but ,so far, I am very pleased . It is mirror shiny , the shape is squared off , which adds to the contemporary style ... The hammered handles are a combo of brushed and shine . The weight is perfect , for me , at least . After washing ,the water rolls off to reveal the original shine .. And , best of all . Who would think you could get such a lovely 8 pc. service for LESS than $30 ? Totally amazing ! And I got it delivered in one day , on Prime ! This would be a wonderful bridal shower gift or a nice gift for anyone, in need of new flatware . No negatives here , as yet ! Just wish there were accessory serving pieces to compliment this beautiful set !, Don‚Äôt hesitate ... looks exactly like photos , even better !!"
"These look really nice and feel heavy. The jury is still out on scratches or rust because I just got them. They recommend hand drying after use so not sure how well they would do in a dishwasher. I currently use a drying rack, but will be getting a dishwasher soon. For the price, I would totally recommend them even if you plan on using a dishwasher. It‚Äôs usually 30 days or more that you have to return items, so I would definitely buy them and test them out. üëç"
"I purchased these about a month ago. I wanted to have them for the holidays because I had my parents over for dinner. The craftsmanship and durability is great. They are not too heavy and very sleek. I love the hammered details and they arrived quickly. My partner is notorious for accidentally throwing them in then trash, which was my main concern. Not two weeks later, I noticed a few forks missing so I contacted the seller and was offered a discount on a set of the salad forks. Great customer service. Very friendly and quick to respond. My father complimented the silverware quite a bit. I would highly recommend."
These are absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't do them justice! Very easy to hold and very easy to clean!
"Really nice set of silverware. I really like the hammered texture, the stainless steel used is of decent to good quality. I think they have a nice weight to them, but not too heavy. Good size, just as shown."
We needed an upgrade on our silverware. We ordered these and they are great quality!! The butter knives are sharp too! LOL... I actually cut my finger on one. But they are seriously a good quality for the price!!
Awesome silverware! Very sturdy and sharp. Also good thickness that gives a nice weight to the silverware. Definitely does not feel or look cheap at all. Very high end feel and look. This was exactly what I was looking for.
"I have only used this twice; when we had company over. They are light; a bit large; but very nice. The 12 place settings are good to have if you, like me, have young ones around that tend to lose silverware. It will be nice to have 4 extra place settings in case a piece gets lost. It would be nice to see servings spoons and service fork included or to be able to purchase separately. A DEFINATE BUY."
My guests always complement on it and I just love the design and feel of it.
"Outstanding!!! Gorgeous, heavy as in strong, shiny and modern. Exactly what I was looking for. Just be very careful with knifes they are sharp. I added pic for positive review not the opposite. Buy with confidence."
"I've had the same flatware for about 10 years. The replacement set is excellent! They came in great shape, packaged very well. You can tell they are well made, honeycomb design looks great and handle very well. I expect to get many years of use out of this set."
The tableware is a nice heavy weight and feels great in your hand. Love the pattern. Only issue is that there are little points on the forks and it makes it difficult to stab the food to pick it up.
I had purchased silverware at Macy's for close to 5 times the price of this set. With the price and quality of this set you can't go wrong. Two thumbs up.
"Just got these today and they look great!! They are heavy, the quality looks good! Love the pattern, nicely packaged and for the price, these are amazing!! They are dishwasher safe but haven‚Äôt tried them yet!"
"This item is the absolute best. Great quality,durability, and functionality. It was such a great item I had to order it again!"
"The craftsmanship of the silverware was beautiful, the durability of the silverware is outstanding. I love the polished look as well and no matter how many times I wash them the polished look dose not seem to go away."
"Super cute and trendy, durable, good form. Bought in 4 months ago and no rusting at all. Bought an additional set today. Really like them. Quality"
"I freaking love this silverware! I love the texture, I love looking at them. It‚Äôs almost like a piece of eccentric jewelry. Go get them already!!!"
"These were purchased for my sister and her college roommates for their apartment. When I was visiting and saw them in person, the style and quality was better than I had expected for the great price."
I love the way these look. I usually get plain and flat but this is a great price for 40 pieces that look great.
Exactly what I was looking for. They‚Äôre exactly as described. Good quality and fancy looking.
Nice set and my wife really liked it
"This are incredibly sturdy and well built silverware. They are a touch on the heavy side (compared to other silverware I've had) but I prefer that. The single and only issue I may have is I have the worst water in the entire country ( our water is pulled from limestone from the Mississippi river) and I don't know how it will affect the silverware. I replace a hot water heater every 5-6 years, faucets every 7, etc because of the hardness in the water."
"I was very happy with this purchase. The silverware always look new, they are well made and ergonomic."
"These are the cutest set, plenty of each utensil for the price. They're so shiny, they look so much more expensive than they are."
I SAW ONE OF MY RESTAURANTS HAD THE SILVERWARE SO I THOUGHT I'M ON AMAZON AND BOUGHT THEM OVER THE MOON THAT THEY ARE AWESOME!
This silverware set is just what I wanted. They are heavy and beautiful and I like that the knife has a serrated edge.
For the price these look like I spent way more so beautiful
"Item is exactly as described, no problems whatsoever. I LOVE the hammered feel of these utensils, and for a 40 piece set this is a great value!"
These are absolutely amazing for the prices ‚Ä¶ some reviews are probably fake because my set was not scratched or sharp.
"We really like our new cutlery set. Nice, sturdy, and pretty. Holds up well in the dishawasher."
"Quality product. Forks are pretty sharp. No one has been hurt but the forks are much sharper. As well as the ""butter knives"" just a weird quirk."
"Was surprised (in a good way) with this silverware. Looks great, washes easily, looks expensive! So far, so good!"
Definitely not light weight cheap silverware. Very pretty design.
My family & I have been using these for a few months now. They are very sturdy & pretty!
"Great product, and solid stainless steel. The design is elegant and makes a very nice set for the house. I am sure these will last while."
We just moved and needed needed to replaced silverware we had for over 30 years. This is beautiful and very sophisticated.
"looks stunning when I used as setting for dinner party got compliments from guest , would be buying another set ...."
I love this silverware. Just right size and very sturdy and looks so nice.
Very pretty set. Looks more expensive than it is!! Contemporary maybe Even Mermaid or costal look to them. I'm very happy with purchase
Robustos y con buen pesi
"We are extremely pleased with this flatware purchase. It‚Äôs very sturdy, thick, and looks great."
Love the stamping on the ends! They look very classy! They wash great too
This was exactly as described. It was a purchase from a bridal registry. A nice gift
"This was a gift for mothers day. My mom loves them, like everyone mentioned before, this are not too light nor too heavy. Perfect weight."
"Great product. Sturdy, pretty, practical. Washed well. Didn't try the dishwasher tho."
Great value i was worried about rusting if wet in dishwasher like my last set . But this set has been very nice.
It is very nice . The thickness is perfect and the knives are sharp. I love it I would buy it again. And it is very good price
"Just what I was looking for. Easy to hold, not to heavy, nor to light. Beautiful pattern."
I love this set....fits nicely spoons are larger than I expected....LOVE LOVE LOVE....STRONG!
Love the look and weight of this silverware. Very good quality!
Just perfect! Love the depth of the soup spoons and tea spoons are just as amazing!!
These are excellent! They are weighty and feel nice! VERY dishwasher friendly! This was a satisfying purchase!
"Beautiful set, very sturdy."
This is a great set. No tarnishing. They are sturdy and I love how big the soup spoons are.
This is beautiful. Very nice set!
Was much better quality than I excepted
Very pleased with my purchase they have nice weight to them and they look beautiful buy now you won‚Äôt regret it.
Looks very nice. Looks more expensive than what I paid.  Be mindful - the knives are sharper than I expected. I actually cut my finger when taking one out of the packaging.
"Lovely. Cost effective, nice looking, very sturdy."
"I love this set! Feels sturdy, the utensils are balanced and the design is very pretty. I've already gotten compliments on them!"
Perfect set
work great
Very nice looking and sturdy especially for the price would recommend
I have only had this set of 40 for about a month but so far im loving them. Not too light not too heavy. Design looks nice.
Love love love!!! High quality and very easy to hold and clean!!! Great for any occasion!
Great product Thank you
Decent set for the price. Love how big the spoons are since I can use for serving as well. I may purchase another set.
This is a really good set you get everything you need plus the utensil holder that fits perfectly into my drawer!
"This is a 49 piece set. It comes with the holder and 8 spoons, soup spoons, forks and salad forks, butter knifes and steak knifes. It fits in my drawer and allows me to keep it organized. It makes a perfect housewarming gift. Perfect for a family to have a set or for a couple or smaller family to have a good amount of silverware"
Feels good in hand. Looks awesome on displays. Comes with good number of sharp knifes. Value for money! Good buy
"The silverware is sold at a good value, and they‚Äôre easy to hold. They also come with steak knives, which is very nice."
"There are so many silverware, those are good quality, and a hard flatware. The quality so good that i didn't realize. Enough for big family, good price. Love it"
"Good set, nice design and good quality. Dishwasher safe!"
Was very surprised with the quality and sturdiness. I would buy again and/or recommend to a friend or family member. Excellent price too!
"Buena calidad, √∫til y buen material"
I am very satisfied. This is a great set
"As ad retired, sturdy and a good value"
"For the price, Great."
Sturdy
Good size set everything looks nice
I was looking for a good set of and was pretty happy for the value from this set. The utensils are made from good metal and are shiny smooth. We currently have a bunch of random utensils that don‚Äôt match at home so this set helps a lot as a matching set.

Enjoying them
Love this set and the tray super strong. Except came damaged.
When I received this the holder was broken in three places. But the silverware itself is nice.
The tray it came in was broken and made cheaply. The silverware is great and pretty sturdy. I would have given it a 5 Stars if the tray was not broken.
"Okay so I ordered this item twice. The first order the item came damaged, so I returned for a new product. The second item was clearly opened and used and it was DAMAGED! I will not try to order again and just want a refund."
I love the quality of the silverware set however the poor packaging allowed the holding tray to be broken in many parts.
They are huge!
Flatware and organizer is nice however the seller is totally unresponsive! The packaging allows the flatware to bounce around within the tray during shipping. The seller is unresponsive regarding this product. Because of this I would not recommend this product nor will I purchase from this seller again. I
Looks so cheap
"This is exactly what i‚Äôve been looking for. Slick minimalist design without cringy over the top outdated designs, comes with a lot more than you‚Äôd need, which is awesome because i live with roommates and things get ‚Äúlost‚Äù often, and the price is great for a everything you get. I‚Äôve ran them on the dishwasher a few times and they are intact, so i think these will last a while. I do wish the regular knives had more cutting power, but the extra steak knives make up for that. Overall good product, good design, and good quality."
""
"I was looking for a new Silverware set for my brand new kitchen and came across this product, I must say it's the best product out there! The knives are equally sharp and they cut very well. Very impressed"
Tiene la cantidad perfecta y el organizador queda excelente para guardar todo y hasta un poco extra si tienes cubiertos de m√°s.
It is a great deal. Those utensils are great quality. Not bad
I really needed to get a new silverware set definitely was time to replace‚Ä¶ This is a nice set i was expecting lighter and thinner metal however its pretty good medium weight for great for daily use plus you get a organizer good deal! It doesn‚Äôt feel like a cheap set. I‚Äôve been using and washing them daily very happy with my purchase.
I really like this set because it comes with its own tray. The design is simple so I don't have to scrub to get rid of food residue stuck in the crevices. The metal is very durable and thick. I've had ones that bent because they were made of thin metal.
"Good set of silverware, we have been using it for a few weeks now . It‚Äôs dishwasher safe , no rusting . Solid set , no complaints ."
"started pitting after the first run through the dishwasher. lots of water spots too, even with Jet Dry in dishwasher. uncomfortable to hold, as handles are too thin. waste of money  Then they try to bribe me $10 to take down the negative review. I told them if they don't want negative reviews, don't sell crap merchandise."
Really happy and satisfied with this spoon and knife set. I bought this one for my new home and it just fit perfectly on my kitchen drawer. Quality and material for all spoons are very good and size is just perfect for different types. I must recommend to everyone. Worth spending.
It's really nice set for lunch and dinner party. We used at dinner party. The quality of spoons are really good. My drawer doesn't get messy because of the trey came along with it.
I found it good material and quality of this set.
This silverware set has really good quality. I was going to just buy it from walmart but their tray is not heavy just plastic and silverware are only 5 of each. I‚Äôm just glad i had decided to get this one instead of buying it from Walmart because it was the same price!
I liked that the silverware set comes with a drawer organizer making it quite manageable given the quantity of silverware in the set. The packaging was on point and I liked that the steak knives were enclosed within a thin cardboard folding's protecting the user from any potential cuts. I have used them heavily and tested them out in the dishwasher as well and they are just fine and is still shiny so far.
It was 40 bucks so i was expecting to get something subpar but this is actually better than expected. I feel these would last a few years as I will not dishwash the steak knives. But again I'm surprised at this quality for this price.
I love this silverware! I wanted something simple for the farmhouse look and this was definitely it! I hate heavy silverware and this perfect not heavy and yet sturdy besides the beautiful finish on it... I had 2 pieces that had a small imperfection but this seller was awesome and had me a whole new set out in no time! I would order from them again knowing they stand behind their products
"they have a good weight to them, and I've ran them through the dishwasher many times now and no fading of the black color"

"I love this set. I actually have three sets of them. I love the rainbow metal and have it in my silverware, hair cutting scissors, cooking utensils, water cups and nail/cuticle set and probably more. My only reason for giving this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because the larger spoons are VERY large. The small ones are normal good sized spoons for an adult but the large ones are a bit obnoxious as they are more like something you would use for mixing or baking instead of eating with. Other than that, this set has held up very well in the dishwasher with no discoloration or wearing off of the rainbow. It has endured that harsh environment of my household and crazy kids thus far for the last 6+ months. Hope this helps :)"
"A great quality set of flatware! The coating or what they used seems durable as it hasn't peeled or even made a scratch using this at work so far. The metal is strong and does not flex like some of the cheap flatware out there. Love the color! Yes, it's black but more like high gloss black."
Not sure what I was expecting but these will do the trick. They are a little thinner feeling that my old Oneida set but it may be just the design. There have been no issues with bending. They have sat in water in the sink and been through the dishwasher several time with no issues. They are black so they will show water marks. The tablespoons are more like serving spoons. The teaspoons are the perfect size for everything else. For those that are comparing these to $200 flatware... you are wrong. If you wanted expensive you should have bought accordingly. I would recommend them or buy again if I need more.
I liked these black utensils the moment I saw them and decided to try them out since we have so many mix-and-match silverware. I‚Äôm definitely going to buy some more and finally have a full matching set! They don‚Äôt withstand the husband-ice-cream-tub test but I think that would be almost impossible to find. I recommend them.
Very happy with these. Have had them about a month and they have held up well. They are not matte black they are shiny.upon others reviews i was skeptical but have had zero problems. I do wash them by hand and dry immediately to avoid water stains. Overall they are a great buy and inexpensive compared to others.
Love them. So much better looking than standard table ware. Very easy to clean food off. I bought two sets plus extras!!
I have purchased them twice and they have been perfect both times!
I got these for my daughter and family because they have a hodge podge of silverware. They have black plates and bowls and the silverware went great with them.
"These are a beautiful, colorful addition to my dinnerware. They feel good in my hand. I enjoy the flair they add to a simple dinner of Summer salad with baked chicken."
Absolutely love these! My late husband bought me a spatula like these so I bought them to match.
"Love this silverware. You can tell by the feel of it that it‚Äôs not cheap, it doesn‚Äôt bend easy. I love the look of them so much, now I just have to get knives that match it lol"
love mine have for several months and no complains
"Very pretty, lightweight, no waterspots and does not have any after taste."
Will definitely buy again I love it way better than other ones.
Very nice Black Flatware. Expensive looking and of good quality. I am very pleased with my purchase.
These are great. I have a full set now. They are dishwasher safe and don‚Äôt fade.
I love it. It‚Äôs amazing. Made very thick
"Love this set!! So pretty, durable,and dishwasher safe!"
I love the color and it's very durable. My favorite set of cutlery so far.
"Excepto producto, tal y como se indica. Bonitos y f√°ciles de limpiar."
I love these! They‚Äôre very nice and love that they‚Äôre heavy and not wimpy! ONLY downfall is that mine came with a couple of spoons having scrapes around the spoon but i can live with it doesn‚Äôt affect it
just plain excellent!
"Comfy to use, easy to clean. What more could you want?"
Excellent product for the price.
Updating kitchen looks good value is good and it feels good in your hand
Beautiful ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è
Love the colors
Exactly what I was looking for color and everything. Changes color at ever movement you make with a piece of the silver Ware.
I have been buying silverware all my life and decided to take a chance buying something with a little color to it. I chose the black silverware. I can tell you that I am one happy guy. They are sturdy and beautiful utensils. They are not made cheaply. It was just what I was looking for. Something beautiful and something different. Lots of nice compliments from friends.
I LoveLoveLove this cutlery set! It‚Äôs FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
I liked it the way it looks. Something different and colorful.
Love the look of them they are really sleek and modern. Definitely plan on buy another set to have more guest. Everything I wanted.
SHE LOVE IT....
Love these utensils. Unique and sleek.
"Great quality, beautiful colors, great addition to my kitchen!"
Love the color!!! So light weight and extremely durable!!!
They are very pretty and quite sturdy
Great silverware set.
"Half the price of getting them individually from my local big box store, and close enough to identical. One of the spoons has a tiny rough spot that hurts my lip, but overall great quality for the money. The package doesn‚Äôt say dishwasher safe, but I‚Äôve been washing them in the dishwasher and they‚Äôve been fine. No change to the patina at all."
"So sleek! Easy to clean, does not rust in dishwasher. I get tons of compliments from company!"
I love it!! So beautiful and easy to clean
"I got the rainbow finish silverware set, and I love them! I'll give it a year and see how well the finish holds up to the dishwasher, but I expect it'll do just fine."
"I bought these two or three months ago and loved them at first, so much I bought two sets! They were beautiful and well weighted, good sizing on all pieces BUT now the sets have discolouration on nearly all the pieces only 2-3 months later. I am so sad for this, I don‚Äôt own a dish washer so I have only hand washed them with the upmost care. So disappointed, I had hoped for long lasting ware but got temporary quality."
"A while back, I got a bunch of iced tea spoons like this. I soon noticed, I ate better with these, more often and healthier foods than I'd eat with our cheap utensils. Having chronic nausea, I need all the help I can get, and this set, despite the low price point, has a feel of luxury to it that makes a meal just a little easier to enjoy."
"They look just like pictured. They are not cheap light silverware, but also not super clunky. My husband is picky and he has no complaints so it's a win for me."
"Sturdy, durable and easy cleaned, very stylish, what more can you ask for in a stainless steel flatware? I absolutely love this set so much I purchased 2 sets of them! I highly recommend this & the seller! Value & quality is superb! Delivery was fast!"
My wife loves these. After several times cleaning even with steel wool it still looks great
"Very colorful and easy to use. Dishwasher safe. I marked 4 stars because some of the pieces have small areas where it seems they were resting on or being held with something that prevented that area from fully accepting the coating so that it's not precisely even. That said, you really have to look for these spots, they're not super apparent. Good value for the cheap price."
"The knives and forks looked nice but I had none of the spoons when I received the package. I tried returning them to get a replacement and customer service is struggling with the request and saying it may take up to two weeks to replace them. Utterly disappointed; other returns of mine were instant, but it wants me to wait for new silverware? Very frustrating the set was missing so many utensils.  Edit: replacements aren't allowed for this item apparently. To reorder them it's costing me $4 more..... because they won't replace it or price match. I am utterly disappointed in the product, would not recommend."
I ended up picking a different brand these type of silverware in a store before our move. Once we moved realize that we needed another set since we have roommates now to go to the store to purchase another set they were sold out. Decided to check on Amazon to see if they had it bought a set and they match perfect
They are absolutely beautiful I just redid my kitchen in very bright colours and I must say this silverware was a very good addition. I would highly recommend the silver Ware set.
"These look more like a slate than black- there's a gray overtone. I was hoping more of a void black. Still, I love the length of the utensils and width of the spoon head. I'm looking forward to using these."
I use one of these forks and spoons for everything. No other words. No other silverware. Just fork and spook.
Love the color affect. Sturdy. I did make the mistake of leaving in in a hot cup of tea for a while; thought it was cool enough when I put it in my mouth...surprise . .it was hot
"I bought a set cause I thought they would look nice, after a week I ordered a second set because I was so happy with them"
The color came off at the first wash and I didn‚Äôt even use the dishwasher I did it by hand! I wish I could give 0 stars!
Comes bundled in rubberbands in the most basic of boxes. Wouldnt recommend it as a gift. The metal is thin so they will bend easy. The spoons are kind of big
saw these in our Aldi and by the time we got to the store they were gone. Love Amazon for having them available for purchase. Enjoy them because they add a little color to my table
These are pretty so far but hold lots of water spots with casual use and hand washing. If I took the time to polish/dry each one they‚Äôd probably be fine. Haven‚Äôt had them in a dishwasher yet.
This was a gift to my closer friend for her birthday! She likes blue and love them! Very unique and elegant.
I wanted to go for an elegant black silverware set and i took a leap of faith on purchasing these but i am glad i did! Very sturdy set.
It‚Äôs been 4 months and it‚Äôs still holding up with color. I never put in the dishwasher per instructions
Absolutely stunning silverware. Scratches easily though. Make sure not to leave soaking in water
"Pretty and unique!  Some imperfections here and there but for this price, it's understandable."
"Unique, looks cool, functional, love them. Bought two sets."
Kids really enjoyed these. Very colorful. Seems like they will last. Pleased with purchase.
They do RUST!! Easy return though
Very heavy well made. It's a very simple design but very elegant. Love the sizes and how many you get for the price is amazing!!
"This silverware is awesome! I bought a set of it about 4 years ago and somehow my kids have lost all but 3 of the forks and spoons, so I finally ordered another set. Every piece has held up very well to my crazy family. I hadn't two special needs children who are very hard on everything, but I've never had a problem. And what I love most of that 4 years after my original purchase I was still about to purchase the exact same pattern/design, so all my silverware still match. You can't even tell the difference between what is new and what is 4 years old. It all looks exactly the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Needed new flatware for multiple people. The weight is better than expected and the handles on each piece are designed well for handling.
These were so nice. Arrived insanely fast. The only thing that I would have liked more is for the spoons to be smaller. They are so big. I find this a lot in sets and wish they would include smaller spoons. Why do people need such giant spoons to eat with? Odd but otherwise very nice.
These are very good quality. I was worried due to the price. The are thick and string and size is average to me. They don‚Äôt look fake like some poor quality silver does. If you need silverware get these! You won‚Äôt regret it.
"This silverware set at first was strange as it came in a small rectangle box, but the material is sturdy and very beautiful."
The stainless set arrived in a timely manner. It was in perfect condition and looks beautiful.
The silverware are very durable and a great price.
"Bought this set for my daughter because she didn't have much silverware. But, she loves it and it was a great price for the amount of pieces. It was a wonderful value."
Vale la pena comprarla
The spoons are really large. It‚Äôs like large and larger. They are easy to clean. Overall I think it‚Äôs a great deal for the amount of utensils you get
Very good quality & pretty.
This silverware is worth the price. It is very study for being on the low end of pricing. The only slight downfall is this silverware is big. I would buy this again for sure
Good for the price . Packaged well. Will use for a few years .
plain but very sturdy and reasonable
Loved the pieces & look
I do recommend this set
Value for the money
Definitely worth the money! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great price
Very sturdy
"I don‚Äôt know why know one else mentions it but these are the biggest silverware I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Bought for our RV. The big spoons are the size of my serving spoons in my house. I guess if you like big silverware, these would be great but I returned for something more normal sized."
This a great set for our camper. 10 servings is amazing. Only thing I would change is the size difference between the spoons. Both are fairly big
"They look a little cheap, but seem to be sturdy enough for every day use. My nice silverware set has slowly disappeared. Hence this cheaper set."
I brought this set because it had so many pieces of silverware for a great price. I should have looked at the measurements. The silverware does not fit in my drawer organizer and all of the spoons are way too large. The bigger forks are also too long. I will be returning to purchase smaller silverware.
I thought I was ordering the same ones as I‚Äôd bought before. These are much thinner and feel much cheaper than I was hoping.
"Look good, hold up in dishwasher just not sturdy at all."
"The strength of the silverware is great, very hard to bend, nice big spoons and forks. The problem though, is they are not all that comfortable to hold. Kind of too narrow towards the top which brings a weird imbalance to them that I didn't like. I do like the bigger spoons and forks for things link stirring when I am cooking and for dishing out sides. I'd say these are more like serving silverware then they are eating utensils. Don't get me wrong, I like them alot for the way you can like say.. scoop up a big serving of mashed potatoes and a nice scoop of a side pasta or something like that, but I guess I just prefer my usual set of silverware here at the house for eating with. No complaints about the butter knives though."
"We got this full silverware set to use since it seems we're always running out of the silverware we already have and our other silverware is a bit older also. Our kids have been using more silverware and losing it all over the place too so we decided to get another set of extra silverware to use. This is nice looking, handy, and useful to have around. They're pretty sturdy, decent, and nice quality knives, forks, and spoons. It has salad/dinner forks and soup/serving spoons and knives. They are pretty easy to clean and send through the dishwasher as well."
"I got these because we needed silverware for our RV. I love them! They are nicely weighted and feel good in the hand. This is a sign of a nice set of silverware. They don't feel cheap, no sharp edges left from molds. They are smooth, comfortable to hold, and stainless! They stay looking great without having to clean like silver. When the time comes I would replace my household silverware with this set. It's simple design is exactly what my minimalist self loves!"
"After decades of using the silverware my mother got me back when I was in college (and of course losing pieces over the years), it was definitely time for a new set.  This silverware set is very pretty. My daughter commented on how ‚Äúshiny‚Äù it is. But the individual pieces are huge. The large spoons, for example, are so big that they will not fit into the correct spot in my standard silverware tray. I can't see any of us eating with them, but they'll be great as serving spoons - seriously. The small spoons are so large that when I eat my cereal with them, it feels the same as eating with the large spoon from my original set. Similarly, we will only be using the small forks. And while we use the knives for spreading peanut butter and such, we wouldn't use them to eat with. Then again, we're vegetarian, so we're all about Forks Over Knives, anyway!"
"We are helping our granddaughter set up her new apartment and were happy to find 40 Piece Stainlesss Steel Silverware Set for 8, Mirror Finish Basic Flatware Cutlery Set on Amazon. These pieces have a nice weight to them and are attractive. They wash well but will show spots if you don't allow them to dry well in the machine or dry them by hand. These are shinier than other sets I have seen, but it gives them a modern look. I like that there are 8 of each....very functional."
I'm very satisfied with this silverware set. I was looking for a set with teaspoons and tablespoons and this set has a lot of each. They stay shiny after lots of washes in the dishwasher and I'm sure will last me a very long time.
"Definitely has a mirror finish and that is it for decoration. These are a very simple plain set which is fine by me. I love the smaller forks that come in the set, something I actually have never had so a nice addition. These would be great as a gift for a college student or a first apartment. If you are looking for fancy and embellished then these are not for you."
I bought these as a gift for a male friend who desperately needed flatware. He loved them! They are perfect for a man. Large and heavy.
"These are a nice weight, nicely made, and their smooth finish makes them a nice complement for any dinnerware. We got the polished version and they look great!"
"Simple set of flatware. I think it is a good price point, especially if you needed to buy several sets for a large gathering."
"We got these for a vacation home. They are actually pretty nice, nothing fancy and the price is right."
Great quality
"My nonprofit is hosting an outdoor dinner and we could not face using plastic ware or flimsy wooden disposables, so we decided to get some inexpensive flatware. We only wanted one fork, one spoon (and one knife) per guest (120 in all) rather than the typical ""set"" of one knife with a large and small spoon and a large and small fork. Who needs all that for a BBQ? We also wanted them to be better than the ""flimsy"" quality you get in really cheap flatware. This flatware was perfect for us. They spoon is exactly what you need for soup or stew (or chili in our case), and the fork has nice long sturdy tongs for stabbing meat or salad. They are also a good medium weight that feel substantial in your hands. I would not buy them for everyday use in my home as I like a heavier weight and rounder feel in my hand, but then I paid $50 a place setting for my stainless steel flatware. Having said that, this flatware is just as nice as many of my friends have in their home. It is also a simple design that can be dressed up or down with your plates and decorations. I am sure it will last for years to come. Now, I just hope the knives I bought to go with them (from another vendor) are as good!"
Picks up food as you'd expect
My kids lost them after a short time so good value since I have to keep replacing
they are what they are and do what the are supposed to do
I love them so much I ordered another set
These are great! Not cheap made
"Good value, sturdy and comfortable design to hold in your hand"
Me encantaron
Very happy with this product
Everyday use
Very nice set
üëç
These are useful but I hate how the spoons are only big. I prefer the smaller ones.
Its nice quality but the spoon width is bigger than expected.
"I wanted to like it for it's sturdiness and seems good quality, but only 3 stars as I'm disappointed and should have trusted what other reviews have said. The edges are really sharp. I like how thick the forks and spoons are but not too comfy even when holding it as edges all around are SHARP. Not a happy camper here! See second pic in comparison to my decades old Oneida.. it's thinner but has smooth edges and really sturdy."
Spoons were longer handled (like a stirring spoon for tea). Not an American sized teaspoon. Also large spoon part.
okay for normal dinning.
"They look so cheap, very disappointed."
Great for the price
"Wow! The picture does not do it justice!! I am so glad I purchased these! I have never seen such beautiful silverware in my life! I noticed as I was putting them away, it barely kept my finger print, that is how beautifully polished and high quality they are! Thank you team Briout! And the beautiful Thank You card in the box!! Now that is real customer service!"
"Bought as a gift for my sister, and she's very happy with them. They're durable and hold up to moderate abuse. She's got a household of kids, so anything that can stand up to that must be good."
"I love these. They are really plain, but they have a nice weight to them and a good price. We bought them for our camper. The only reason I rated them a four star (and I may come back and give it a five star after I've had them for a few months) is that they came with a warning not to leave them in water or food as they could rust. They are supposed to be stainless steel, soooo the rust warning is concerning to me. But, we'll see. I'm not planning on leaving them in water or food, but I will be watching for rust."
I was very pleased with this silverware. Wasn't sure what to expect as they were reasonably priced. Very nice looking. Sturdy and we'll made.
Beautiful set. So glad I purchased this set.
They feel pretty sturdy not at all cheep and flimsy. They work wonderfully for there intended purpose and are easy to clean and haven't shown any signs of rusting. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. üòä
"Decent, inexpensive flatware. No sharp edges. Decent weight. Comfortable to use. I bought for my picnic bag but will probably buy another to fill in my kitchen drawer."
This set of silverware works good for my camper
Great design sturdy and great for big families.
"Very nice set of silverware! Came quickly, and no issues with them in the dishwasher!"
Looking it
"I am very pleased to say, I love this setü§ó"
Love this set
"The utensils are sleek and long, and the addition of salad forks are a bonus."
I‚Äôm happy
A bit lightweight and small for man hands but good overall value
Family liked it
Love this flatware !! Simple yet elegant!!
Nice love it
I like my order.
Very nice quality
Really good heavy but not too heavy utensils
I love it
Surprising quality.
Looks great!
"Bought for my son to take to college, great value."
Very nice
I use them for thanksgiving simple elegant
"Nice, low cost flatware set."
Good for the price!
Very nice pieces
Nicer than I thought.
Bueno y barato
Very nice and good price
Bought it for my daughter & she is very happy with it.
Home use
Very happy
"I do not believe these will hold up past a year, maybe two, and should probably return them. My youngest kids like the tiny size of the smallest fork and spoon but I do not. They‚Äôre too small and the larger fork and spoon are too big. They‚Äôre not heavy in any way (step above your cheap flatware in a restaurant) and fingerprints show up easily. Again, I should return them but I have waited two weeks to receive them and my youngest kids love the tiny forks and spoons. Definitely would not recommend the purchase of these.  Updated: after having about a week. I‚Äôm returning flatware. The tiny fork and spoon, the handle bend and weight just are not satisfactory."
Had to get a rotary tool out to dull the ends of the butter knives because I cut myself on one of them!!! I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to return these though because I like everything else about them so far. Can‚Äôt beat the price.
"High quality set. Not packaged for a wedding, but if you're looking to purchase silverware, this is a great set. I am super picky about the size of my silverware, I like mine on the smaller side, and these and definitely on the bigger side. Great for guys. I still like then though."
"The set is very basic, but at the same time they work very well. so far they are still shiny and easy to clean. I haven't had any of them stain so far."
They rusted in a few spots and I haven‚Äôt had them long. Other then that they‚Äôre great.
I love this set... But I am not a fan on how big the forks and spoons are. I like smaller silverware. But they are very nice
Very plain jane but great for those who are just starting out. Serves their purpose and affordable
Okay
Not unhappy that i purchased sturdy silverware
"The package was totally broken, but everything is fine without that problem. Also, I don't know what is black residues inside in bags, it's washable and fine....."
"I ordered two of these and one if then was missing two spoons. Posted to company but they never responded. It is good flatware, the company just doesn't care if you are getting what you ordered"
Cheap not good quality
Sigh... the tea spoon is way too big and the spoon to use to eat with is also the same.
This set delivered quickly and is exactly as described.
Well no small spoons to use.They are all to big to eat a bowl if cereal with
Do not buy this product. I had the set for only 2 weeks when it started showing signs of significant scratching that I haven‚Äôt had with other silverware. Although the look nice they are defective. Tom
Checked all the boxes! Quality/ Balance /Simple Elegance For Crazy Cheap! (& Mom loves them!)  (Would like to get more teaspoons For Ice Cream & Long Tea spoons to match)
Very sturdy. Much better than I thought they would be.
I absolutely love them.
These were a gift for our daughter and her new place. She loves them!!!
"Guys, for this amount of money I wouldn't dare to expect this quality. There are amazing!!!"
Exelente producto me encantaron ü§©
Do NOT waste your money. This silverware set is rusting after literally one wash!!! So cheaply made
"I waited a while before doing a review for these to simply be certain that they could hold up/last for more than a month with the insanity that is at any given time 2 teens and 5 grandkids. They have indeed. I've put them thru the dishwasher and we primarily handwash everything and these beauties dry perfectly. They've got ""heft"" to them; to mean you know you have one in your hand and not some flimsy thing. I really love this set and am beyond thrilled to have ordered them!"
Used them for a bday party and was going to dispose of them after. Decided to keep them after all. They are sturdy and great for any occasion.
"Bought these utensils for the break room at work. Super nice, sturdy, great price."
So shiny
Basic and beautiful. You cannot beat the price.
Beautiful! Just beautiful üòç
Love this set! We have company over and my 20 price set wasn‚Äôt cutting it. I‚Äôve run these through the dishwasher about 30 times since I‚Äôve had them and they are holding up nicely no scratches like my other set
These are such great value for their price. They work well and I haven‚Äôt experienced any rusting or weird edges. I would definitely buy these again!
So for the price and how much you get they are great. It‚Äôs what made me want to buy them. But they arrived scratched and although it‚Äôs not the biggest deal but it does make them look cheap if you really pay attention. This is just out of the box so I‚Äôm worried about how much they will scratch after using them in general. But if you‚Äôre looking for cheap silverware they are still usable out the box.
A pretty nice and value for the money you spend these are fairly good quality for the price I was expecting them to band easy but they hold their shape they're really a good deal
You get what you pay for. Need a bunch of new silverware go for it don't have to worry about kids messing up these ones. Kids keep bending spoons on ice cream.
"I was doubtful for the price. Wonderful bright, shiny, Nice balance and weight! so far I have sold another on it. My teens each ""barrowed"" from my old silver it was past time to get a new set. Truly love them even after using them a bit!"
I had the cheap Walmart silverware that rusts and plastic silverware until I saw the price of this was basically the same as the cheap Walmart silverware. In the past I paid over 5xs more for less pieces. And as it is stainless steel it shouldn't rust.
So very pleased with this product! Very good quality! Would definitely buy again!
"This product exceeded my expectations. Quality, durability, dishwasher safe."
Good for everyday use. The utensils have some weight which is nice and they are finished off well.
Good set with good weight to each piece and sleek design. They work well and are a fraction of the cost for what you get compared to other utensils.
Love this product. Use them everyday. Wish I had known about them sooner. Definitely recommendable.
I chose these because of the smooth transition from the handle to the blade or to the tines or to the bowl of the spoon. It is so much easier to keep these clean than those that have sharp corner or edge there.
Wanted a set for my RV works great uniform feel well made
Awesome value for the price. We are a family of 5 so we need a lot of quality pieces that didn‚Äôt break the budget. This works perfect.
"Great price and best price I might add that I could find in stores and on Amazon, perfect number and set!"
Very beautiful will surely will recommend it
Great deal for the price
Great
I told you I liked it.
This silverware was great for the price! Do not seem cheap at all. They are very sturdy!
I like the size
A good purchase its value is awesome
"Nice weight, easy to hold,"
Very sturdy set. Looks great.
These utensils are sturdy and of great quality. Very happy with purchase.
Great quality.
Love them!
Pleasantly surprised at the quality!
Loved them as soon as I pulled out of box. Light weight. Simplistic.
Light but sturdy flatware. Great for travel and outdoor use rather tan plastic flatware.
These are a little bigger than my others but very nice quality and lots of pieces. Seems like we keep losing forks so i hope we dont lose these. lol
Everything is as expected
Good value for the money. Needed an extra set because with kids in the house my utensils kept disappearing üôÖ. So far sturdy and good quality. Very happy with this purchase.
Good quality for the price
Good value
"Sturdy, worth the cost, simple design"
"This silverware I b have ordered is for everyday use. Very, very sarisfied with quality.  Thank you Barbara Cotter"
Very good just as indicated
Look good
"Great set, great price, much nicer than expected."
"This set is a keeper!!! Nice and heavy, so comfortable and smooth. Might just have to buy another ‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£"
The silverware set is excellent especially for the money. It is nice and bright. Sturdy and the structure is easily held with hands.
They lasted so far and I'm happy.
"This set is beautiful & high quality. A great value, exactly what I needed!"
I like that they
Balanced and comfortable to hold
I absolutely liked the product.
Fast and perfect for what I need
Very good quality
Great pieces well made for the price
Good silverware at a good price
Love the quality for a low price.
I recommend this product at 100%
Great price sturdy and enough for the whole family.
Solid set for the price. There is not a huge difference between the size of the small and big spoons. The small spoons are definitely not teaspoons. Not a big deal though.
"Rusted the very first time it was run through the dishwasher! I have included a couple photos, but these are not the only pieces that rusted - many more did as well. I am extremely dissappointed."
"Very nice flatware. Surdy, nice finsh and appropriate size. I knocked down one star category due to incorrect order. Too many small forks and not the right amount of small spoons. Amazon had this corrected right away and order is complete. Make sure you count all pieces when they arrive."
Got them for a wedding gift
Very nice set and not pricey.
"Great product, great price! They feel very expensive, and don‚Äôt tarnish!"
"I loved these spoons, very sturdy (they do not bend) and so many for a great price!"
Wasn't great quality
Very please with the quality and value of this silverware.
These appear to be solid pieces of flatware. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Each piece came in an individual plastic sleeve. A pain to unpack and wasteful.
"The item itself is pretty good, looks as is advertised in the picture and they all come individually wrapped which is good because it avoids scratches during shipment but the package to the item was poor and before I even opened the box they were spilling out of its original package into the shipping box. Too many heavy items for such flimsy original packaging. Other than that though the item itself is good and is as advertised."
"This set is super original which I loved. However, after only a few months, it‚Äôs already rusted on half the pieces. Most of the spoons are rusted and a lot of forks in between the spikes. Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get ahold of the seller. But super sad. I won‚Äôt be purchasing again or suggest it to others due to what happened with my set."
The flatware in this set seems to be made of poor quality. A number of pieces are tarnished when simply opening the package and they will not shine. VERY DISAPPOINTED  We returned this set and ordered another.  John J Hogan
"These are a value for the money. A little light for my taste, I like a little heavier"
The quality of this product is good for the price. However the large spoons and small spoons have the same size bowl. It may have said that in the description but I was used to a smaller spoon having a smaller bowl so I was disappointed in that manner.
"You often see silver or gold flatware, but I feel it's rare to see this black set. It's stunning next to any flatware set. I've run it through the dishwasher multiple times and there is no discoloration. The steak knives are super sharp, great for cutting meat, or accidentally slicing fingers :( (user error) Great sturdy set, highly recommend."
Very nice looking looking when you get them but after a while the rust and tarnish wud I can return but can‚Äôt because of time frame.
"This set was very pretty, I did return them though from my own misreading. I thought they would be matte black. No fault of theirs though, super glossy and beautiful and annive heavy weight silverware"
"I was pleased with the quality of this utensil set. The finish looks really nice and it has a nice shine to it. All of the utensils are sturdy, and I was really impressed with the serrated knives. I‚Äôve only ran them through one or two dishwasher cycles at this point, but I‚Äôve not noticed any damage or fading, fingers crossed! But I think they are lovely and they were just what I was looking for for my kitchen."
I like the long thin look of these utensils. I also love you get steak knives with it. They are kind of weighted in the hand which I like. They are fancy and when they are cleaned they do not have spots dried on them. They are matted but have a flicker of sparkly bits in there. I like the length. My husband is a big guy and they do not look dainty in his hand. He also approves of these. I will probably buy another set. These would be good as a house warming gift. They're sexy :D trust me!
The handles seem a little longer than normal silverware. The whole set is good quality. Steak knives are very sharp. I believe because of the color you can see water spots but wipes off and has a good shine. I would buy another set. Worth the price
I did an inistal wash in the dish washer which is explicitly said to be safe in the description and all of the butter knives rusred right away. After a few more washes we started seeing it on the steak knives and then on a for here and there. Absolutely will not recommend to anyone. I will be replacing these as soon as possible. I have only had them for a month and half the set is rusted.
So far so good. They are beautiful. I always get complements. They are so much better than the traditional silver. Great buy.
Great silverware set.
I bought these right before Christmas because I‚Äôm changing all my things in my kitchen black and my mom loved them. I love they are dishwasher safe. Love the look. 100% recommend.
Love it‚Äôs a true black easy to hold
Great value
I wanted something black when we remodeled our house !! These are perfect !! Need to order more !! üòÇ
I‚Äôm very happy with this product and for the price!
"I really like these things. I like the way they are made, the way they look in the utensil drawer and how they look in use. Good purchase!"
Nice product
"It's good, nothing else to say. It's not exactly black though but very nice."
Didn't realize how much I would love this set of silverware
I love the look and they feel very sturdy in my hands. This was what my plate was missing!
Substantial flatware. Very happy
This BLACK Silverware Set is definitely one of my favorite gifts to myself. Stirling Silverware is old school. It was time for something new. I love it!!
They are absolutely perfect.
Great supplemental set. Inexpensive and sturdy.
Very nice and sturdy
"Needed new silverware, The weight is so light and the sheen on this set is Awesome."
Beautiful set that includes everything you need for everyone from a bachelor to a family of four
Elegant flatware that is a nice finishing touch to your dinner table.
"These are fabulous! They look elegant, feel nice and sturdy not cheap and best of all they‚Äôre dishwasher SAFE!!! Item was exactly as described and arrived earlier than expected."
I love this dinnerware set! I never thought I would say that dinnerware is elegant. It;s a great value.
They're just dope
This silverware is balanced. A slight bend near the handle gives comfort to use.
Very pretty!
"S√∫per lindos, muy bien empacados y muy resistentes Un producto sensacional"
"Love these black silverware. These work exceptionally in the kitchen, are sharp and preform great."
The smallest fork and spoon are smaller than expected but still a great set and I‚Äôve loved having it!
I love this set of silverware. Great quality and value. I will be ordering another set.
"Exactly as advertised, perfect weight, great quality"
Loved the silverware! Looks very modern.
I like the color match color plate set
Great product!! I love my new utensils set!!
Love love love
I like it product
"great set, love it"
I like the gloss it has and that it‚Äôs not a dull/dry black
Like
"After 3 months if use, I got tired of pulling out utensils with damaged finish and bought a replacement. The seller claimed that these are dishwasher safe, but clearly they are not."
"I was skeptical at first, but very happy with this purchase.  If you are looking for a true black as listed, don't get this set. They are a dark gray/gun metal color which is why I took one star off. I actually like the color and don't mind. They are sturdy/heavy like normal stainless steel flatware and easy to clean. My favorite part are the steak knives which are hard to find in a set like this for more than 4 settings.  Exceeds expectations and totally worth the money!"
It's not really black like advertised. It's more of a dark gray. Other than that it's good
"Soooooo, ultimately I‚Äôm really in love. I bought these as an overall house gift for my home for Christmas. Right out of the box, I was very impressed. The matte black finish is to die for. Super elegant. There‚Äôs two sizes of spoons and forks, which is a must. In the reviews I had read that the steak knives rusted on other buyers, if left in the sink. I haven‚Äôt found that to be the case. No rust for us 3 months in of everyday use. The set has been run thru the dishwasher time and time again with virtually no issues. My only complaint overall is that some of the pieces have gotten dinged/scratched up. Now some of the pieces have silver showing thru where it‚Äôs scratched. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, and not noticeable unless inspecting the silverware. For the price, you get a good amount t of silverware that is beautiful, and sturdy for the most part. I love the product."
"As many of the other reviews have said, the product rusts after only one or two washes. I don‚Äôt know what the deal is, the temporary dollar store utensils I was using prior to this didn‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm really bummed."
Absolutely love this set BUT I ordered this one because there was supposed to be two different size forks. I only received ONE size fork and my missing smaller forks were replaced with double the amount of steak knives. I would have given 5 stars had I received the correct amount of everything pictured.
"I usually put my washed utensils on the drying rack. However, with this black kit, the surface is covered with visible water spots. So the utensil looks dirty when it is not. My solution now is to dry them by hand."
One of the pieces came chipped. I requested a new knife but was given a credit instead. I really like the looks of it. Tired of the stainless steel stuff.
This product said dishwasher safe! Bought on July 11th and my steak knives are rusting!! Very disappointing. Such pretty dinnerware yet so disappointing. So sad.
"I love the color, but they run on the small side. Maybe they're supposed to. I was a little surprised by it."
Not too shabby‚Ä¶ the steak knives aren‚Äôt the best though
"They are very light, look nice.  Even they are light but they hurt my palm since their handle ends are little bit sharp.  Not recommend!"
Even after hand washing; I have to completely dry and polish them
"Really liked these when I ordered them. They are very light weight however they are not sturdy. The fork pieces bend when cutting meat and holding it with the fork, and they dont last if you use the dishwasher. The coating comes off and then they rust. no bueno."
The duality is not what I expected for the money. The metal is cheap and bendable on forks. Does look like a matte black and just looks very cheap. The knifes almost feel like plastic knives like disposable knives. I‚Äôm returning item because I don‚Äôt even want to deal with owning these. The only reason it gets as high as two stars from me is because they didn‚Äôt break.
I hand wash these and dry them as soon as they are clean. Started rusting. Where's the warranty??
I‚Äôm not a fan of these. The forks are actually sharp and poke me. The finish on them easily rubs off. I also just personally don‚Äôt like the way they feel. The big spoons feel to big and the little spoons are to little. I wish there was an in between. I have literally gone back to my cheap Walmart silverware because I just don‚Äôt like these.
I liked it until we ised them
I received my order today and got steak knives and butter knives only. No forks or spoons!
I love these but the black on them is starting to come off after a couple months.
"Felt like these could be easily bent. Also spoons had very minimal depth on the curvature of the spoon so I think if you were eating something with a more liquid consistency it would not be easy to eat with. But they do look very nice, and this was a great value, just not sure they would hold up well over time so we returned before use."
"Good quality so far (I‚Äôve only hand washed) but I expected a more matte black, it‚Äôs a glossy dark gray."
"Spoons are small, very light weight."
The forks and spoons are great! The knives rusted in the dishwasher.
"Color coming off and rusting already, less than 3 months"
"I no longer have to eat with my hands! After 36 years of being a neanderthal, I can finally eat like a civilized human being. I find the shiny metal to be quite fascinating, not as fascinating as fire or the wheel, but still seems to captivate my attention. The cavewoman cleaned these utensils and they still have a luxurious shine to them. These dinglehoppers are pretty simple and serve their purpose. One to poke things, one to dig things, and two different size hair brushes! Me love!"
"Great looking set, very shiny and elegant looking. They also feel pretty sturdy in your hand. No signs of rust or wear, we have taken special care not to soak for long periods. Of note - each piece is individually wrapped upon arrival, be EXTRA careful removing the wrapper from the knives, they are surprisingly sharp and haste may lead to an accidental finger slicing :("
I've been using them for 3 months and just realized that all forks and knives edges are rusting or the coating is coming off... It definitely does not seem sanitary to use them now.
Bought these and the forks immediately started rusting after 1 week of using. Super disappointed.
"I have more expensive flatware that I don't really like. On a lark I decided to buy this. It's cheap. I like the shape of it better. It fits in your hand and doesn't have pressure points. So far, in my dishwasher, I don't see a bunch of rust like I've seen in other flatware sets I've had. But like I said, It's cheap. The knives seem pretty stout, but the spoons and forks are thinner and are not as nice. But, that's not saying they are bad. If I was just starting out... perhaps a college student, or getting my first apartment, then these would be just fine. Amazing value if you put it in the right context."
Rusts easily. Cant understand the 5 star reviews. This is a scam.
"First of all I want to clarify that this experience that I lived with this set of cutlery may not happen to you in the future, and I hope that this never happens to you. Firstly in the first washing in the dishwasher the cutlery acquired some stains that I could not clean with anything, I want to clarify that I use a good detergent and do not use hot drying in my dishwasher. Second and worst of all, my husband and I at the time of eating our dinner the fork hurt our lips, and we noticed that the forks came with imperfections in the metal that literally cut, they left us some small wounds but nothing serious. Absolutely I did not have a good experience buying these cutlery."
Don't buy. The knives rusted almost immediately.
"I was looking to replace flatware that I'd been using for years and was hesitant to order flatware online without feeling the weight before purchase. However, this flatware exceeded my expectations! It was carefully and individually wrapped when it arrived (as to not be scratched) and came in a carefully packaged box.  The weight of the flatware was solid- It is not filmsy or bendable at all.  I washed them in the dishwasher before use and they came out extremely clean (no water spots!)."
"The forks and teaspoons in this nice basic set were larger than I expected, but as soon as seller Lianyu learned I wasn't completely happy, they quickly said: ""We would like to fully refund your order without returning the set as our compensation to your unsatisfied shopping experience."" Sure enough, they did. I hadn't even asked nor expected that!  Now, as for the flatware: It's way better quality than I expected for this reasonable price. Good weight, nicely balanced, smoothly finished edges. The knives are great: They have small teeth, so you can use them for cutting meat or slicing steamed brusssels sprouts, as well as for the usual spreading butter or jam. Have used the tablespoons to scoop ice cream out of the carton; they don't bend a bit.  We use the set daily. Handwashing is quick and easy. Soon will be getting a second set, with smaller dinner forks and teaspoons, to add to it.  A good company to do business with, imo."
"I have been using odds and ends for flarware in my single person household. It was not a big deal, but with a friend coming for the weekend, I decided to upgrade. I could not find anything worth purchasing in local stores. I did not need extra servong pieses; I just wanted the basics. This set was perfect for me. It has four pieces each of the pieces pictured: 4 knives, 4 soup spoons, 4 teaspoons, 4 salad forks, 4 dinner forks. The set is shiny; it has the weight of a more expensive set."
"A couple came with a couple dings but let's be real, after a month or two of use we would expect that anyways. They are lightweight and on the cheap side - but cheap done very well. I bought them to get by and it will do that far better than my old series of 5 sets that I had strewn together. (For some reason I have a fork gnome who steals one per month) . They are nice enough to get by. Itll work. Thanks, guys.  UPDATE MONTHS LATER - I think the set is very attractive and worth the buy. If you need to look good for a cheap price these look great and function well."
"If you have kids ( I have 5) and you need more silverware becuase they have carted it all off to the backyard treehouse, under the beds, and forts in the closet... then this is the perfect product for you! Its quality and doesnt bend easily. I love the simple design and the weight of the pieces. I will most likely be a repeat buyer.. becuase kids."
"The silverware set came missing one dinner fork. Other than that I am pleased. They were packed nicely, inside the box they were wrapped individually, bundled by type and then wrapped in bubble wrap. They look and feel like a quality stainless steel service should. The design is simple, clean and highly reflective, lacking all ornamentation (I'd be happy to never see another spoon handle made to resemble a bunch of flowers or some fanciful family crest). I've sent a message to the seller about the missing fork, I hate to return things. I doubt they have my fork just sitting there waiting to be reunited, but who knows.  Aug 7 2019 Update : Seller responded quickly and, as I didn't want to return the set, offered to compensate for the missing fork. I'm happy, and would have no problem buying from them again."
"I have these expensive plates and wanted a cheaper option for silverware and these were perfect! I am sorry the color does not show well in the picture, these are truly a rose gold finish. Good weight to each piece. I only wish the packaging was different, maybe a matte black in case of gifting."
"After my separation, I had to move out of my old place where we had nice, sturdy Crate & Barrel flatware. Because I was buying so much new stuff, I was trying to be, well, economical about it. Enter the LIANYU 20-piece silverware set.  While I wouldn't use any of this to cut a porterhouse or fend off an intruder, it is perfectly acceptable silverware for eating sad bowls of dinner cereal or buttering old toast. (When I can afford butter.)  It cleans easily and I haven't managed to bend a piece of it yet, so I'm calling it a win."
"You never know what you might get when you order these types of things online. I loved them from the minute I opened them. They are sturdy, are easy to hold and came through the dishwasher just fine.  I am picky about the pattern of utensils in regard to how one is able to hold them. Patterns or any designs or anything weird that hits the area between your thump and first finger really drive me crazy. This set‚Ä¶ no problem and they look nice."
"i shopped around & reviewed many sets of black silverware. these came recommended by someone i know. i wanted a good looking set by shape & one that the finish wouldn't flake off. these look nice & we'll see about durability. i do dish wash them, but have only been using them for about a week. also, they're very light & don't feel solid in the hand, but that's not such a big deal for me. i ended up ordering 2 sets."
"I got these when I moved and they're a good simple set of silverware. Hardier and heavier than I thought they would be. But let me tell you. I don't know what dinner that dinner knife is prepared for but I'm gonna go ahead and say anything. Someone make a tough steak? No need for a steak knife, just use this bad boy. I didn't have any other knives or silverware to speak of when I got these so I was using the dinner knife to chop vegetables and I took a chunk of skin of on two separate occasions (something my old admittedly dull knives probably weren't capable of), and once again while I was just washing it. 100% would not give it up."
"I bought another slightly different set before this one which is not so shiny; but it's ok. I love the change from ""silver"" utensils to black. Everything feels nice in my hand. It may seem kinda funny, but I like the salad forks a lot because they are smaller and will work really well for little people. They are shaped like the dinner forks. My old set had salad forks that were kinda short and stubby and the points didn't even work well for salads. Better for desserts...."
"Bought these due to price. It was a great buy. Got them on sale, and when they came in, we were impressed. I also got this pattern as I had a similar one but pieces missing. This set is heavier and sturdier than our old set. They are close enough to our old set to deal with every day, but if we need to look good we pull out these as they are much nicer."
"I was expecting a lighter, lower quality than this product is. Surprisingly, it looks much like the flatware I have now which cost much more. I got it for my husband to use in a rehab center where they served meals with plastic utensils and it was exactly what I needed--sturdy, comfortable to use, and not so expensive that it would matter if it got taken out on the facility's meal tray by mistake."
"All of these rusted. The knives rusted first, then the spoons and forks awhile after. I have no clue how these have 4.5/5 stars. Don‚Äôt buy this garbage. It‚Äôs literally unsafe to use rusted cutlery. I‚Äôve now added some photos of what I‚Äôm talking about. Don‚Äôt be like me and see the few reviews about rusting and buy them anyway. These will rust. It might take a few weeks or a month but they will quickly rust. You‚Äôll be buying silverware a second time, if you do."
Goes great with my royal Albert dinner set. Very pleased. Bought them for a dinner party I was hosting at home for some special guests. They were perfect. Each piece was packed individually. Nice to hold sturdy and heavy in a good way. The color is proper gold and not dull gold. They paired well with my royal Albert old country roses dinner set. Washed with hand and let them air dry. Good to go for next dinner party. Highly recommend
"This set is perfect for our household of two. We live simply and this set fits with the casual vibe we have. The individual pieces are medium weight, heavy enough in the hand that they don‚Äôt feel cheap but not cumbersome. The sizes are fairly useful. The large spoon is quite large, and I find it useful when adding ingredients while cooking or when I convince myself it‚Äôs healthy if I only eat just one (albeit giant) scoop of peanut butter straight from the jar. I was surprised that the knives are sharp enough to slice through meat with ease. I put off buying a set of steak knives for now after experiencing the performance of this set. Service for four is perfect for two moderately lazy people who don‚Äôt like to do dishes after every single meal. I‚Äôve had the set for about a month, and I see no signs of wear and tear. Overall, I am very pleased with this set, and I doubt a better value can be found!"
"This is a substantial flatware set. Every piece is well balanced, has a beautiful polished stainless finish , and the overall appearance of this set is equal to any nationally recognized brand name. I have used and cleaned this set a number of times already and it all comes out wonderfully. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants a well dressed table. Follow the care instructions that are included. They are the same care instructions that come with any quality set. You can't go wrong with this."
I debated wether to buy these or not since there were so many mixed reviews. I am very pleased with them though and recommend them. I have left them in the dishwasher and soaking in the sink and all states of drying over the past 3 months and they have not rusted. They are shiny and feel heavy and high quality.
"Exactly what I wanted and I am not disappointed. Short story? Great colour and good packaging. Exactly as indicated.  Breakdown: The packaging ensured as little shifting as possible to avoid scratching the pieces, all of which were individually wrapped in a thin film for added protection. Despite this, two of the knives had *very tiny* scratches.  At first, I was concerned about the contents since only 4 of the 5 types were shownon the front face, but the small forks were within the rest of the package. All 20 pieces are there.  The pieces have a black finish and shine very nicely at some angles (just like most utensils). I tried to capture that in the picture, but I‚Äôm not the best photographer.  All-in-all, pretty solid pieces. I‚Äôll definitely buy again if I need more in the future.  EDIT: Bought again :) I will update once more if the quality should differ."
"Picked these up as I thought they looked good. Absolutely not disappointed with my purchase. In fact, I purchased another set, and will probably end up ordering one more. Love the look of these, and the quality, so far, has been good. No chipping, no issues in the dishwasher. So far, they've all been great."
"I thought a 5 piece serving for 4 at this price would turn out to be flimsy and not look fine at all. My mistake -- it is well made, easy to hold in your hand, and knife has a serrated edge which is excellent for use with meats. Because of Covid we find we are using the dishwasher more often and keep running out of silverware. This pattern though not exactly like ours goes with it fine."
I bought these utensils maybe 1 1/2 years ago and they still look great. I don't know if cheap spoons deteriorate but these certainly don't. I've had no issues and think they're great quality for the price!
"Table Spoon is more like a Shovel !!!! but it's great for Ice Cream Right? was leery of the black stainless but I definitely recommend them over plain jane stainless!! they match my Kitchens Black stainless appliances to boot!!!  they do great in the dishwasher, and I use a soft microfiber towel to dry them. and I got the matching black wire mesh utensil drawer and its perfect for my cabinet"
"These are a great addition to our kitchen - the matte black is super unique and they are a good weight without feeling flimsy. Plus, the price is excellent for a 20-piece silverware set!  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition - my only issue was that each piece was individually wrapped in clingy plastic so it was kind of a pain to get everything out.  Pay attention to the washing instructions and dry thoroughly, as they do get pretty visible water spots."
""
"I bought two sets since I knew I‚Äôd go through dishes way too fast for just one set and am glad I did. I was pretty surprised at the weight and design for these as I was kind of expecting a little cheaper feel so I‚Äôm very happy with that. Very nice feel to them, sleek look, and I‚Äôd say better than pictured. I do wish they had just come in a larger set but maybe that‚Äôs normal for silverware? I like that it has the two sizes of forks and spoons. I‚Äôd buy again and recommend."
"I purchased these as a starter set for my new home. In my 42 years, I'd never been cut by basic dishware much less a ""butter knife"". I sliced my thumb open twice on these things. Once while opening and the other while washing. I learned to respect these knives as if they were ""real"" knives.  CAUTION: Butter knives are VERY sharp. Know this in advance and all is well.  I would recommend."
"I ordered the black ones. Love them EXCEPT they came with chips in the paint. The black is chipping off and I can see the silver underneath. very upset about that. It came like that right out of the box, without even being used.  **update** the seller has fully refunded my order and spoke about checking all of their inventory to ensure this doesnt happen in the future. Great customer service. I am now happy"
"These are great for everyday use. I wouldn't recommend for entertaining. These tend to scratch easily. After two weeks I could see giant scratches from a distance. The finish around the edges is not so great. This is very visible in the forks. I dont have a dishwasher so I dont know how these wash in it. But when washed by hand and left to dry, there are huge watermarks. So definitely wipe these down after washing."
I haven't had any issues with these eating utensils. I wanted something in black to match my plates and they are perfect. I haven't had issues with them but follow the directions and it says to not leave them in water etc. so I'm paranoid and wash and dry them immediately. So if you're on the go and want to leave them to soak then might not be the best product for you because the instructions say it can be harmful to the coloring to leave them in water.  So far so good and again love the color!
"If you are looking for something to keep you from having to eat with your hands, these will definitely help a civilized diner. They transport food from plate to mouth spectacularly. Wonderful!  I will say the spoons seem rather large, but they will still do the trick."
"The entire set was actually better quality than I expected. They have a good weight to them and don‚Äôt feel cheap at all. Very easy to clean. When using very hot water, they dry very quickly without water spots on them. They don‚Äôt seem to scratch easily, either. I will probably order another set to fill out my silverware drawer now that I have found a good set to use."
"I got my first set of this silverware over a year ago when I moved into my first apartment. It fit the budget and looked great. I've purchased two more sets since then so that I have a matching service for 12. They feel great in the hand, not too heavy and not too thin. All pieces wash amazingly both by hand and in the dish washer. I get compliments on the utensils from guests and none of them believe that each set was only $20. Better than any other budget set you could find in a big department store."
"These utensils have a great weight to them and are nice and sturdy, yet have a sleek modern look. The working ends have a nice shape and are not too big or too small. The knives that come with them are surprisingly sharp for ""butter""knives. The only down side, is they water spot out of the dishwasher, so a quick rub with a soft towel after the dishwasher is a good idea if the spotting is an issue for you. (only takes a few seconds) I am very pleased with this purchase!"
"Simple and elegant but super bright for its price. Lightweight but super clean and shiny, will make your table look bright and modern with this look.  There are no frills decor on this- forks and knives are pretty sharp which is good for meats. Spoons are good- does not leave weird residue after you wash unlike some other silverware. Does not need polishing."
I have been searching for black flatware for several months. Single sets at retail stores were going for $25 each! I decided to roll the dice with these and I am glad I did. Absolutely beautiful and I have gotten many compliments on them. Easy to clean. Highly recommend. They look more expensive than they are!
"Very good quality, even better than those at much higher prices. I bought my second set immediately after I received first one. They are looking so good and sturdy. Strongly Recommend! It will be perfect if serving spoon could be bigger, and provide options like higher price to add cutting knife and serving spoon with strainer"
The black finish is elegant. I‚Äôve had guests make many positive comments on the unique style of these silverware. Very happy with my purchase. I had the opportunity to contact the seller and they were great in handling a small issue I had with one piece. Highly recommend these!
I like this set of silverware because it looks an feels like silverware that would cost much more than what I paid. This has no short comings that I can see. Feels great like a very high quality products for a much higher cost. I truly recommend this set of silverware to any one who wants a great quality set at a reasonable price.
"I needed to replace my silverware after moving and thought the black color looked nice. Several months later I've had no problems with the black coming off or getting scratched (I don't hand wash them), and I've gotten many compliments on how cool they look. I will say the large forks and spoons are a little large for me and I generally stick to the small ones, but guests are fine with the larger size so it works out."
"This is a truly beautiful set of flatware. It's sturdy but lightweight. In all honesty I am considering to return it and for the simple reason that I am stating I would also consider marking the rating down to a 4. You can see in the picture, the LIANYU soup spoon is on the right. The LIANYU teaspoon is in the middle and the teaspoon I was hoping for and expected is on the left. Had measurements been provided in the description or an image, I would likely have not bought the set."
"I needed cutlery soooo bad, because we just moved. This set is wonderful. Affordable and it holds its shiny appearance. Over joyed w/ this product. I would definitely purchase this set again!!!"
The bride and groom to-be seemed to be happy with this product
"wanted a new set of cutlery to use everyday, this is well made & i feel it will last. came very well packaged i am pleased with this product, highly recommend thanks"
"Wow. I am amazed by this flat ware. At first I thought after a few times in the dish washer the color would come off or look different. Not the case. It looks really good, super different and elegant/ modern at the same time. They are pretty heavy and good to hold. I get compliments all the time when I have friends over for dinner. I love it!!! Would highly recommend this"
It truly is a great value. Since I do not put them in the dishwasher they have stayed shiny like new now for a long time.
"My silverware arrived yesterday and I snapped this picture after taking them out of the dishwasher. I think the simplicity makes them even more attractive. When I decide to increase to an 8 piece setting, I will reorder. I love the simple classic design and I like to eat with them too! LOL"
"Very good material and grwat size. We are very happy‚Ä¶ my husband is fussy with silverware, so was worried about using this for everyday use. He had no complaints!"
We had a cheap set of silverware for when my husband and I were dating and just starting out. We shopped around and decided we needed an upgrade. We love this silverware. Now we just need to purchase this same product again so we have enough matching silverware for when we have company
"When I moved cross-country a few months ago I didn‚Äôt bring along anything that I could just easily purchase again for cheap; needless to say, my silverware was one of those that didn‚Äôt make it. This set is a great replacement‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt expensive but looks good and that‚Äôs really all that matters. Would buy again!"
"We've had this flatware for close to year. They've been through the dishwasher dozens, perhaps hundreds of times and every piece still looks brand new. No scratches, no stains, and no discoloration. The gold tone flatware we've had in the past has not lasted very well, but this set is extremely durable. If you want a gold tone flatware, this is the one to buy."
"I was skeptical when I first ordered this set but thankfully they were better looking in person, soft metal material makes it nice to hold, almost a matte finish but still has a slight shine which I love. Easy to clean! I‚Äôve only had this set for a month but so far they are very reliable and durable!"
"After looking around, I settled on this silverware set because it seemed to be the best quality for the price point. They were packaged very well and have a good weight to them. Don‚Äôt feel cheap at all, smooth finish. Great starter set for the price point. No complaints"
"Great basic set of flatware. Super sturdy, strong. Simple design. Sleek. The only downside was the excessive packaging, but it paid off and I'm not about to dock points from being overly cautious. Very happy with my purchase."
"This silverware came packaged well. Each piece was in individual plastic, then grouped and wrapped in bubble wrap. Do take care when opening the knives - they are very sharp. The set is nice for everyday use. Each piece has a good weight to it, sturdy. Instructions for care come with the silverware and the seller sends further instructions for making it last. I‚Äôm very pleased with this product."
Overall this black silverware set looks very nice and is very sturdy. We have no issues using and no issues cleaning. Mine have been in the dish washer many times and they look very good and handle well.
"I haven't purchased flatware in years. Found these for a good price and ordered them. They arrived quickly and look nice, feel nice, are sturdy and I expect they will last for many years to come. I appreciated the care to detail in that each piece was enclosed in its own wrapper. Very nice simple set of flatware for my new 5th Wheel RV."
"This is sexy. The mirror black is just, yes. Don't ever but stainless steel again Personalize every aspect of your life. Stop out the box, be you, be original. I did. I love these. Piece the puzzle together with some cotton napkin, placemats, napkin holder, and table runner with candles, shhyyyyt. Play on player. Approved by (single) Dad."
"This is my favorite set of silverware. The weight is well-balanced in the hand. They're strong and sturdy, won't bend or break. Easy to clean and they don't spot. I also love how minimalistic they are. They're so affordable, I ordered 2 sets so I have enough in case I ever have 6-8 people here for a meal."
"This is a high quality set of silverware. I was a little reserved at first when deciding on whether to make the purchase, due to the price. I simply did not think the low price reflected the quality. I was very wrong. Lol  I am very happy that I made this purchase, as this set is fantastic, and I will be purchasing more soon."
Shiny and reliable cutlery. I've been using them for years and they don't even have any scratches on them.
"I spent a good week doing research before deciding to go with Amazon for a flatware set... and I was patting myself on the back for making that choice, once the product arrived.  I was taken back and leary at the numbers of bad-quality reviews I was consistently seeing for name brand 18/10 stainless steel flatware, as well as reviews mentioning rust. I didn't find even one review against Amazon for these issues. And by comparison to name brands, this 65-piece, service for 12 set was certainly selling at a very reasonable price as well. The look, size, luster and strength of this set is 5-stars, all the way. Simply exceptional!"
"I moved into an apartment and needed a simple set of utensils. these arrived well packaged and pretty nice, honestly. I immediately washed them and put them into the draining board to dry. the next morning each of the four knives were rusted along the serrations. I used a scrub sponge to scour away the rust and realized, stainless steel should not rust... I can live with the issue and am doing so, I was a little surprised at this. the spoons and forks have been excellent."
The worst purchasing experience. You will be disappointed. The worst design.
"These were well priced, good shapes and sizes, but they just don‚Äôt hold up. After 2 rounds through the dishwasher, the knives have rust spots. I‚Äôll have to buy a new set after only having these a couple of months. Not impressed."
Started rusting after a month. Cheap Chinese stainless. Not pleased and won‚Äôt buy amazon basics again.
"I love this flatware! Seriously amazing deal, just a ridiculously good value, so I figured I would order a set because I had 3 mismatched sets of flatware in my drawer. These pieces are much heavier and sturdier and better quality than my previous flatware was, including the Oneida set that was my ‚Äúnicer‚Äù stuff. And the matching set of serving pieces are so nice. I don‚Äôt feel embarrassed about my mismatched forks and spoons anymore, these are nice enough for guests and sturdy enough for every day. Love it!"
"I'm just ""ok"" with the pattern. It's simple, well-done as far as consistency, and pretty low-key. We're getting these before the listing page is even done, so I couldn't see details of the pattern til they arrived. I don't know what pix they'll end up using, so I've added a few of my own.  The reason I'm still giving it 5 stars is sheer quality of construction. These are *nicely* done. Good solid metal, no wimpiness at all. The tines on the forks aren't real thick, so there's no worry about them shredding your food ;) but they're still very strong metal. I'm frankly very impressed with the quality.  The serration on the knives is a great compromise of cutting ability or more delicate things like buttering toast without trashing it.  The spoons have good sized bowls in the more elongated style.  I enjoy using different patterns in things like flatware, glassware, and other types, so I won't be getting more of these, but I will definitely be putting these in for our every day use, and I'll update if any issues pop up."
"Took a chance on this - the price was too good not to, and I have to say I'm delighted with this flatware. I like the pattern, they're sturdy and so much better than the junk I had before which cost much more. This set is a winner."
"Received my order today, 01/03/18. Came on time. Packaging was nice and compact. The utensils themselves have a nice heft to them. Does not feel flimsy, feels high quality. Each individual flatware came wrapped in plastic sleeves. Overall, a good value."
"Unlike many, I have strong opinions about Silverware. I had only 4 place settings of some very nice, high quality, heavyweight Gorham 18/10 Stainless. I love that silverware ! I don't like flimsy, cheap diner type silverware. I bought another set from Macy's (International Silver) and was totally disappointed. Very light, no balance or heft and a pattern that actually dug into your had at the butt end of every piece. I wrapped it up and donated it. I was going to go all in and buy US made Liberty Tabletop (old Oneida brand) for almost $300 for a 12 setting set. I glanced at Amazon Basics 65-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Silverware Set with Pearled Edge, Service for 12 for 1/5th the price. Now, I want to be patriotic and buy American, but I can't justify leaving $200+ on the table. I bought the Amazon Basics set and could not be more pleased! First off, the pieces are HEAVIER than the Liberty Tabletop pieces. They are big and the pattern (Pearled Edge) is done tastefully and virtually matches the Gorham I have. I know it is 18/0 and not 18/10, so the shine will not be as pronounced, but for dinners in which you are not expecting the Queen of England, these are wonderful. Thanks Amazon, excellent value!!"
"Happy with them in terms of quality. I have not observed rust, discoloration, or bending of these utensils since purchased and used 3 years ago. Always toss them into the dishwasher without issues.  They are a bit heavier than some of the flimsy kinds, which I like. The tea spoon is larger than a typical one for stirring, which I like as well. It‚Äôs definitely not a delicate set of utensils and more heavy duty."
"If this logo was not on knife, I could give 5 stars. I can't use AMAZON BASIC things for my important guest. For daily use purpose, it is great."
"It is a little bit like buying a ""cat in a sack"": I bought the 65 items silverware set on amazon.com and it went straight to the recipients in Poland for their 60th wedding anniversary (I live in the USA). My purchase was based solely on the customers' reviews and the number of 5-stars the pearl edge set received for balanced weight, luster quality and even edges. I am a little bit worried it may be rusting, though. I hope that the recipients will be pleased and will not experience any problems during the time they will have this set.  I chose this gift for their 60th wedding anniversary for two reasons: it is a 60+ piece set and each fork, spoon, knife, etc. symbolizes one year of their marriage, plus there are bonus five serving spoons. Then, the price was only a little bit over $60. which also symbolizes a one dollar per each year of their marriage. Even though a price cannot be put on these 60 years, I'd rather spend the money on durable goods than on sixty roses that will wilt after a week or two (the shipping was an additional cost, of course). Then, there is a large family and the tableset for twelve is not going to be enough, so I am glad that there is an imprint on each piece, I learned from other customers, says AmazonBasics. That way, if anyone ever will want to order for themselves, there is the name.  I am waiting for a verdict coming up next week as to what the celebrants, who are like my adopted parents, thinks of this present.  I also ordered, to go with the silverware, a set of 12 Utopia Kitchen Cloth Napkins in red, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L1IHY22/. They got good reviews. Red color is versatile and can be used the 60th Anniversary Celebration, for Christmas, Valentine's Day. It simply looks so elegant and beautiful on a white tablecloth."
"As a bachelor, you tend to pick up only what you need at any given moment. That includes flatware. You can go to a big box store and pick up a knife here and a fork there, and you can buy in small quantities for a buck or two. After a while, when you realize that you need to grow up and you could possibly entertain a guest or two, you look for a decent and economical solution.  This Amazon Basics 20-piece flatware set is perfect for someone who needs something for themselves and can still host a small dinner party for family and friends. I bought it along with the serving set and it's just perfect for my needs. The weight of each individual piece is hefty and feels good in my hands and, of course, you can eat food with it! What more can you ask for?  Amazon Basics has become a trusted brand for me. Anytime I'm looking for something to use around the home, I always check to see whether Amazon Basics makes one. If they do, I always give the item serious consideration because the Amazon Basics brand has helped me be a better housekeeper. üôÇ"
"As a single parent of a teenage daughter, I've been using disposable forks and spoons for far too long. With only one income, I just wanted and needed some decent silverware/flatware at a reasonable cost. After looking and reading reviews for what seemed like a week, I settled on this set from Amazon Basics. As far as bang for your buck, I'm not sure these can be beat. There wasn't a blemish on this set when received, and they feel pretty sturdy/weighty. Whether they rust or not, remains to be seen, but I don't expect these to be any worse than any of the similar brands I looked at. Will edit if anything changes, but happy for now."
"I love it, you can't beat the quality for the price! I was tired of using my old thin silverware, when stirring food, as it would cause mild discomfort to my hand. This silverware is much thicker, and my other silverware was not the super thin flimsy stuff, and this is even thicker. I read the reviews prior to purchase where a lot of customers reported inaccuracy on the quantity they were to receive, quality control may have stepped in since then, as I wasn't missing anything. It also is very shiny, looks like very good quality and you simply can not beat the price and I also loved the different styles to choose from. I went with the scalloped style."
These are an excellent value. We have been needing more utensils for a long time. Saw these and decided to buy.  For the price you can't beat these.  Other reviews mentioned the Amazon basics trademark on these. Doesn't bother us one bit.  The trademark is located on the back of the handles as well. So it's not incredibly noticeable. Not sure why it would be an issue for some at this price point to be honest.  Will update my review if I see a decrease in quality.
I don't know if anybody else has this problem but I will randomly have some of my forks and spoons go missing. There might be a leprechaun stealing them out of my house because otherwise I don't know where they go. So just to restock my drawer I bought these and They are what you would expect. I think they are better quality than the cheap ones you can get at Walmart and they seem like they will last longer. I'm very happy and I would buy these again
"WoW! $20 spent expecting something to get by on for day to day use. I was planning on using this set until I could get something with a better name and also what I thought would be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. Boy was I wrong!! This set will, I imagine, last a good many years. It‚Äôs heavy but not uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt have big hands , I‚Äôm small boned but have long fingers. I was actually looking for a set to use the Salad forks as my go-to daily use. The knives are amazing. Have a beautiful cutting edge and I don‚Äôt even reach for the Steak knife anymore. It has a beautiful design, exactly what I was looking for!! For the Money it‚Äôs a Win-Win on this purchase!!!"
"For the price, I am thoroughly impressed. My partner and I moved into our first apartment about 6 months ago and we started with a $20 silverware set from Target. It was okay, but ultimately flimsy and cheap. The spoons bent and the edges weren't very smooth. These are heavier weight (but not so heavy that they fall out of your hands), sturdy, and smooth on the edges. I really love them, and the scalloped design gives it a really classy and timeless look. Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. I will note, though, that one of the spoons had a chunk of some black substance that flaked right off, but I washed every piece before using any of them and everything was fine!"
"I have two teens. For some reason, my silverware gets lost when they do dishes. As a result, I needed to replace my Oneida set and did so with two of these. They're well made, easy to clean and have a good weight to them. They are a bit heavier than the Oneida I had, but it's not enough of a difference to make a difference.  Since my kids apparently throw silverware away when they don't want to wash it, they're grounded and I'll be buying a couple more of these sets to have on hand for next time."
"These are good quality for the money, but the sizing is off. My original set has teaspoons that are actual teaspoons. The Amazon basics ""small"" spoon is in between my big & little spoons and really too big for my kids. I am going to keep this set because we need replacements and I don't want to keep buying tons of different sets, but if you are particular about sizing I would order a small set first to see in your house first."
"Running a kosher home, having separate cutlery for meat, dairy, pareve (and Passover versions of all three) can get very costly. Especially when you‚Äôre hosting lots of guests for meals. These extremely sturdy, beautiful utensils are superb value for money. I‚Äôve now purchased two sets!"
"These are actually doing their job and then some. The logo is lame but we're not trying to impress people so I'll let it slide. They are heavy duty which is great in a home full of neanderthals, which we have here. The bigger spoons are HUGE. I honestly didn't know what on earth I was going to use them for until I saw the afore mentioned neanderthals shoveling my beautiful chili into their mouths with them. Gross AF to watch but they're pleased with amount of food they can paddle into their mouths with them. Seriously, it's nasty so I'll spare you the details of the horror I've witnessed. Anyways, nice product. Spoons disappear here and I noticed you can buy them separately. Yay!"
"These are good quality clear plastic warehouse. They could easily be hand washed and reused if needed, like if you were camping or hiking. They come in 4 or 5 , I forget which exactly, packages of complete sets. So if you were eating outside with just few other people you could pull out one of these packages and you'd have what you need. Good choice."
Great set for the price and I love that they don‚Äôt have nickel. The picture is of them after more than 20 times in the dishwasher. Not to mention they have sat in the sink over night many times without rusting at all. They do have a few water spots but I love them especially for the price.
"It was very easy to hold and it looked very clean and presentable in general so I knew it was pretty high quality. There are different models to choose from and delivery was also on point. It comes with knives, spoons and forks for a family of four so if you need more or less, I would still recommend this product and overall, I think it's worth it!"
"I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I like these. I'd had the same silverware set for years, and while I wanted to replace it, I'd been putting it off b/c I didn't want to spend a lot of money and it wasn't absolutely necessary. I ended up ordering the 65 piece set with the rounded edge, and I'm really pleased with it. It's heavy enough that it doesn't seem cheap, but not so heavy that my kids have a hard time with it. While I wish I had a few more of the serving pieces, the larger sized spoons are big enough for me to use for most things so it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase."
"Wanted this set because I was cleaning out the drawer in my kitchen with the utensils and realized how mismatched they were. Just bits and pieces of several different sets - with parts that have gone missing over a number of years. So I wanted to start over with a new set. These were on sale and looked to be something that would be decent enough for every-day use, so I got a set. More than adequate for me - and I think I may order another set just so as to have enough for eight settings. I'm happy with my purchase."
"I am impressed, this is nice stainless ware. Its pieces are heavy duty and crafted very well. I wish Amazon would come out with specialty pieces like serving and slotted spoons and forks to match this set. I would buy!!! See you around AMAZON !!! Even though Amazon has come out with several new pattern designs the traditional Scalloped Edge is without a doubt the nicest one. A fine set of flat ware. See you around AMAZON !!!"
I needed new silverware but it can be so expensive! Did my research- and this one had good reviews. IMO you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs not high end- it washes well in the dishwasher- and I love the variety of sizes of the forks and spoons. Totally worth it!
"1 year in they look as good as new. Put then through dishwasher nearly every day and leave soaking in water in sink after every meal. No rust, so seems like a winner. Read the descriptions, only one of the sets actually mentions being high quality stainless steel!"
This was perfect for what I needed and priced right. The utensils are wonderfully light and shiny. I'm a single person who hadn't bought any in years and was down to a couple of mismatched forks and spoons. These are perfect. I like that they're much lighter in weight than what I owned before and they honestly look fabulous.
These were purchased to blend with my existing Oneida flatware which is no longer sold. I was pleasantly surprised how sturdy and well made each piece was and discovered each piece actually weights a little more than my Oneida ones. If I hadn't already bought 2 sets I would definitely purchase more! You will not be disappointed.
"When I first ordered this set of flatware I was in awe of how wonderful they are. They are the perfect weight, look appealing and are right up there in quality with some of the higher end brand names but a fraction of the cost. I ended up buying a second set within a day or so because I love them. They are easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I‚Äôve had no issues with rust or anything else for that matter. It truly is nice to seta good looking table."
"I didn't expect much for 20 bucks but I'm very impressed with the quality. Highly polished, thick, hefty and sturdy. You'd have to drive over them with a truck to bend them. Seriously good stuff!"
"I love this silverware set. You get 65 pieces for less than a dollar each and they are all good quality. I live alone and I don't entertain, but I'm weird about the pattern/weight of my flatware and these are perfect. The last set I bought was way too heavy and I didn't like using them. I also love that I finally don't have to worry about running out of utensils before I fill up my dishwasher."
I've been using these for 6 months and the spoons still transfer cereal to my mouth without talking back to me. The forks also stab watermelon without prejudice. It's stainless steel kitchenware.....
"For years I had a hodgepodge of different utensils and far too many. I decided to donate the old stuff and looked for a nice set that didn't cost a lot. I went by the previous reviews and decided to order them. They're very nice looking, sturdy and they wash very well. My daughter said she's happy we have pretty utensils now."
"These were heavier than I expected for the cost. Ended up buying two sets because the first one we had sent to the wrong address and it was easier to just buy a second set; technically I could have returned but since the fault was on our side and I have two family members who need flatware, I kept both and now two of my kids have the same set.  These are a lot heavier duty than the inexpensive thin ones I originally set up house with longer ago than I'm going to say!"
"The set is very nice. The pictures doesn‚Äôt do it justice. They are very shiny, the matte parts are very nice as well. The utensils feel heavy and sturdy. They are very easy to clean. I like to hand dry them as soon as they go through a rinse cycle to protect the shine and quality but, it‚Äôs not necessary. They are very good quality. Did not disappoint."
"Like the weight of each piece. Knives will cut fruits, vegetables, bread and some meats. Probably not sharp enough for steak but did a good job on ham and turkey and brisket. We have only used for a week so I gave this a 4 star for durability because I really don't know. Easy to clean a 4 because the knives did not clean completely in dishwasher but I don't know if the dishwasher was not packed right or if it is a problem with the knives themselves."
"I needed a new silverware set for my apartment, and AmazonBasics seemed to present a good option. I was a bit hesitant since some of the reviewers described an unsightly ""AmazonBasics"" label printed on each of the silverware pieces -- I have to say, while the label is there, it's not very noticeable to me in real life. What is most notable is how light these pieces are; it took a little getting used to, but I'm happy with my purchase."
"This flatware was purchased for use in church fellowship hall for celebrations and family parties. it is very attractive and sturdy, and does not have a cheap institutional appearance. Excellent quality at a reasonable price."
"With a 2 year old, our flatware disappears all the time. When I realized we only had 1 spoon I ordered these. These are super heavy and very durable. I really love that it came with serving utensils. It's just the 3 of us (bf, son and me) but we do have a large family and invite people over all the time and this set gave us 12 pieces for each item (big spoons, little spoons, big forks, etc). Totally love and worth the money. Buying a set for my sister and her new husband."
"Been using these for 3 months now, and I can‚Äôt express how awesome they are.  Good in the dishwasher. Easy to hand clean. Strong utensils. Bang for your buck."
"Its surprisingly difficult to find a simple, contemporary flatware set without spending a fortune somewhere like Crate & Barrel. Was initially a bit skeptical about the quality of the set, but then realized it was the same as the set we'd be using in our share house for years - and that had held up very well! We love entertaining so this is a great sized set for us, and amazing for the price! Thanks Amazon!"
I was very impressed with this very inexpensive flatware. My granddaughter just graduated and is getting her own apartment and needed everything so I got her this and also the Amazon Basic dinnerware set and I am very please with both items. They are of a very good and heavy quality. I was shocked since they were not that expensive. They don't look cheap either. I think she will enjoy both things and will have a nice way to set her table. Everyone will think she paid a big price for them. I would definitely refer my friends to the amazon sets.
The silverware have the perfect weight extremely durable and easy to clean I couldn't have asked for a more affordable set of silverware. I highly recommend
"These are some high quality silverware. I'm impressed. They are nice and thick, not flimsy like others. Shiny & easy to clean. I like the style of the butter knives. slight serrated edges. I would buy these again. They are a great value."
"Nice set of basic stainless steel eating utensils. Every restaurant should be judged on it's flatware, if a restaurant invested in this flatware I would be impressed. They have a heft and feel to them. The forks tines are not going to bend if used for side cutting. They should double down and sell them in sets of 100."
I have found that Amazon Basic products at least the ones I have purchased are pretty good value as far as quality goes. This tableware is no exception. I recommend this to anyone in need of a set of silverware. Shipping was fast and the packaging was adequate.
The product was exactly as displayed. The silver matte finish and the design are exactly what I was looking for. The price couldn't be beat. Certain individuals in my house don't always look before turning on the garbage disposal and for this price I can easily reorder as needed.
This dinnerware set is perfect for the new college graduate. The utensils have decent weight for flatware and have not stained.
"This set is very sturdy! My husband accused me of spending a small fortune on such nice silverware! Then I told him the price and he was shocked! LOL! Highly, highly recommend."
"Great utensils! Looks more expensive and high quality than the price would suggest, very sturdy and made with stainless steel. I like that this comes with several sizes for the spoons and forks, instead of some of the flatware sets that only come with one size of utensil. Sometimes I was cheaper utensils and they end up rusting but these are still sparking after a few months of use. I purchased the scalloped edge version and it's nice enough to even use for a dinner with friends in a pinch."
"I was looking for inexpensive cutlery that was still from a brand I had heard of since they are touching all the food I eat. I decided to go with the amazon basics option and so far they have worked very well. No problems going in the dishwasher, no issues with bending or denting. They might not be the utensils I go with long term but for a young professional or college student I think they are a great choice."

Was a much better quality build and a much cheaper price than some of the other brand names. Better quality and much better price.
They are not too fancy but yet not simple. Great feel and balance to them. It is not easy to find a comfortable fork? i know that sounds silly but it is not easy. Love these.  Gloria
"This silver set is the best! They are light weight, yet wide and grippable. They are also well-balanced in the hand. The spoons have a wonderful round bowl shape with less of that ovular extension. Milk stays in the bowl better with your cereal. The fork tines are nicely curved and long enough for the curvature. Put simply, this is the best silverware set I've ever used in my 53 years and the price makes it the best value."
"I have bought lower end silverware in the past and they have felt light and flimsy and would probably bend under the ice cream scoop test. However, these are pretty heavy, feel durable, and have had them for a couple months and notice no rusting like some other cheap sets.  This is a durable set, well worth your money."
"This silverware set surpassed my expectations 10-fold! What a beautiful set at an amazing price! I purchased the pearlized set (the one with the dots around the edges), and its very appealing to the eye. I love the weight and size of these utensils too, they feel great in the hand. I've been very pleased with Amazon Basics products, and very happy with the price versus quality!"
"A great set at a great price! They're heavy, and look like restaraunt quality. If you're on the fence, go for these!"
"I was getting tired of the cheap ones sold in my local stores. Either their cheap and break so you have to buy more often, or they're more expensive than what silverware should be. These are a more decent price without being the garbage I find locally. They clean easy too!"
"This is a pretty nice silverware set. They're not flimsy nor too heavy. None have scratches so far (I've been using them for a few months), and they're easy to clean."
The metal prongs on the forks will bend under almost any pressure and the squared edge of the prongs makes it hard at times to clean between the prongs. Value for the money this is still by far a HUGE winner
"Bought some replacement spoons a few months back and was very impressed with the quality and style. My kids even commented on how much they liked them, so when I noticed we were short on forks, I bought this combo to make them. Again, Great quality, heavy enough that they don't bend and hasn't lost its shine!"
"I am picky about silverware; I like them to have a certain weight or heftiness to them. Tasked with getting more silverware for my roommates, I went with this affordable option and have been pleasantly surprised.  The silverware has a nice weight and great balance, possibly even better than my $60 set that I have for myself. The one complaint I have heard around the house is that the large spoons are too big. They are considerable bigger than even standard big spoons, and are really better suited for serving than using for cereal. Maybe if you sipped soup out of them they would be fine, but they are a bit big for the average mouth otherwise."
"Great quality for the price. I hate that it says ""Amazon basics"" on the side, but that's the only complaint. People complaining about rust, all you gotta do is scrub it off after washing it, if it appears. I've seen a few spots now and then and I just wipe it off."
"** update ** I have been using them for a while on all temps, foods, drinks etc with washing them quite frequently and the color is still just as beautiful as ever. No fading, chipping, or discoloration. I am so happy and ordered a second set. If you‚Äôre contemplating buying them or unsure over another brand buy these. I love them and so happy I got them. So unique and beautiful. The second photo is after some use the first photo is fresh out of the package.  Ok so far it seems sturdy, the color is beyond beautiful and goes great with my matte black dishes. I am in love and these utensils are amazing! Will update after some use to see how they hold up."
After washing SEVERAL times this is what happens. I ate food using these several times before realizing they were continuously releasing a black soot-like-substance. I tried contacting Amazon support about the matter and they did not understand *at all* how serious the problem is. DO NOT BUY.
"Love my new silverware! I searched high and low for black silverware and was nervous about finding something that was truly dishwasher safe and good quality overall. So far, this set has hit the mark. They have a nice weight to them, have held up in the dishwasher after nearly a dozen washes, and just add some edge to my dish ware. I can‚Äôt speak to long term durability however. Some people have remarked on the water/finger marks that get on these, and while that‚Äôs true, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs anything severe. They can be wiped off and frankly if you‚Äôre worried about every little mark on your silverware 1. Don‚Äôt get black and 2. Be willing to spend more than $30 on it. We love this set and from our experience thus far would definitely get it again."
"These are so beautiful! They arrived super quick and were well packaged. They are decontamination matte black, I‚Äôve already washed them and the held up just fine. I‚Äôve not used them to eat yet but they are worth the money! They look just like the ones at target that you pay 20.00 for per place setting!"
I got three sets of these living in a house full of 6 people. They get washed in a dish washer often and so far have lasted pretty good. I'm impressed. One got scratched from hitting it with a knife so just be careful and they will do you good !
"Wow. I am amazed by this flat ware. At first I thought after a few times in the dish washer the color would come off or look different. Not the case. It looks really good, super different and elegant/ modern at the same time. They are pretty heavy and good to hold. I get compliments all the time when I have friends over for dinner. I love it!!! Would highly recommend this"
"I couldn't find what wanted in the stores, so I decided to try these. They are awesome. LOVE the matte finish and the weight quality makes them feel much more expensive than they were"
"Love the unique color of matte black. The pieces are oversized, which I like, and the weight is great. The handles do leave a little bit of a print when handled, but no more than traditional silverware does. Will be purchasing a second set to keep on hand!"
I have been looking for cool black silverware everywhere. Everywhere was about $20 for a five piece set. These were 20 pieces and for less than any where else and they are awesome quality
"It‚Äôs a nice silverware set. It has a good weight to it and holds well in my hand with a comfortable grip. It‚Äôs also been through the dishwasher a bunch of times by now, and holds up nicely without weird water marks. Doesn‚Äôt bend. I‚Äôve had some silverware sets bend pretty easy, it would take a lot to bend it. Overall extremely pleased with this set-would buy again."
"Used these to complete our Diner en blanc table at DC‚Äôs event 2019. They were perfect. Loved them! They looked so nice and I was surprised by how much I liked them ...I wasn‚Äôt planning on using them at the house Bc I just wanted them for the event, but now I plan to use them for special occasions like Thanksgiving or if we have friends over for dinner! I hand washed and dried them after the event and haven‚Äôt used them again but they looked fine after. Hope they will last!"
"Better than expected. Heavier and sturdier than pricier brands I've purchased in the past. Read reviews on gold flatware thoroughly, because I noticed a lot of people reporting gold layer coming off on different brands, even pricier ones. The finish is satin-brushed pure yellow gold, not too tan or orange like some gold housewares."
"Everything about these are amazing - the color, durability, sturdiness, ability to clean. I would say they are even more sturdy than regular ""silver"" flatware. But, water spots show up VERY easily, so I would NOT recommend having these dry lying down. If you have them drying while upright, then 95% of the time there will be no water spots. I washed a knife and laid it down to dry and when I came back it was FULL of water spots, so I've made sure never to lay them down to dry again!"
"I was SO excited about the appearance of this cutlery when I received it, but after having these for less than a month the rose gold color is already wearing off and I can see the stainless steel coming through. I‚Äôm so disappointed but luckily I noticed it while I could still return them."
"Excellent quality! Exceeded expectations. We have used these several times (not our every day silverware, but have brought them out every time we‚Äôve had company), sent them through the dishwasher, and they look beautiful. One thing to note is that they do show watermarks more easily than your standard shiny silver will, but that‚Äôs not a reflection of the product quality, just the nature of the color and finish. Get yourself a quality rinse agent for your dishwasher or dry by hand, and you‚Äôll be very satisfied!"
I wanted to buy some flatware to use when I had company and these were such a great price for what I feel is good quality. Recently we remodeled our kitchen with black and white cabinets. I absolutely love these!
"I waited a while to do this review because I wanted to see how they age. I wanted to give honest feedback, and I can honestly say I 10/10 highly recommend this set. I love them! They‚Äôre beautiful even to this day. I‚Äôve had them for months and they‚Äôve held up with no issues. They‚Äôve received many compliments from friends and family and now I‚Äôm starting to see more and more people getting them. They‚Äôre very luxurious and elegant at our table. They mesh well with any set, I‚Äôve changed bowls out and many different plates in my set and they match everything. I hope this review helps the next person."
"Read several reviews of this flatware before buying that talked about the finish wearing off, so we only bought one set of four. We've been using a single set of all 5 pieces for the past 30 days, and have been washing them I. The bottom rack of the dishwasher and mixing them in the drawer with our stainless utensils. So far I haven't seen a single scratch or chip of the finish on any piece, and they've been used daily. The quality is very good. Not quite as heavy as our old pieces, but each utensil seems very strong and well made, and look as new as when we took them out of the box. I plan to test the other 3 sets for the next few months, but I won't hesitate at this point to order a few more boxes down the road."
"I‚Äôve had these for a year exactly, and they have held up soooo well. Some of the reviews talk about easily bending and color fading or coming off. I have not had any of these issues at all! The go through the ringer at our house. I have two teen boys and a toddler boy who can destroy anything that gets in their hands. These still look brand new. I even put them through the heavy wash in our dishwasher machine everytime along with other sets of silverware that most likely bang against them. They feel very sturdy and heavy like a set of expensive silverware. No different since the day I opened them a year ago. We have lost a few but I blame that on my teens lol I‚Äôm going to buy the champagne gold color next. Love this set of silverware!!"
Love this flat ware. Perfect color and easy to match with. (Placemats are from CB2)
"Before I got this flatware I noticed some mixed reviews, so here is my contribution. Got one set in December 2019. Immediately washed and put into use. It‚Äôs been a couple of months and I‚Äôve since purchased an additional set. These are holding up beautifully! They get used. They go through the dishwasher all the time. They sit in the sink and soak. We don‚Äôt treat them specially; they are everyday flatware and get treated accordingly. They are surprisingly weighty and substantial, which we did not necessarily expect. The finish is lovely; smooth, not totally matte, but not too shiny either. They do tend to spot a tad from the dishwasher, but that‚Äôs probably our machine‚Äôs fault. We love these!"
These were a gift for a wedding shower and the bride and all the guests loved them. They are a nice weight and the color is really pretty. Definitely better quality than I expected for the price. I might even get myself a set!
I'm obsessed with my set. I read some reviews about black rubbing off after repeated use etc but mine have held up great! I've had them for about a month now and they get put in the dishwasher on a daily basis. If all continues to go well over the next few weeks I will order another set.
I purchased a set of the silverware for my wife for Christmas in the Matte black. And she absolutely loved it so much that she made me order another set so that we could get rid of all of the old silverware. It has such a great sleek look to it and it is actually very easy to clean. Although I will state that I have only hand washed them we do not run them through the dishwasher because we are afraid of the finish being washed away so we hand wash and dry these only. But overall impressed with the quality and excellent look of the set. Definitely have gotten several compliments on them as well
"If you have been looking for black silverware, I highly recommend. They look beautiful and better than I could have imagined. I originally bought one set to make sure I would like then as some reviews state they are not completely black, which is true. When you look at the not straight on, they do appear black, but if you look straight in it almost has a gray undertone. Regardless, I loveeee. I think I actually prefer that too now. One thing I knew prior to buying black silverware and you should too, is that it is best to hand wash and drying right away. These are dishwasher safe, and I have dishwasherd them, but I ended up hand washing afterwards as I could see water spots on them. If your dishwasher is better at drying, you may not have that problem. It was not a lot and not on everyone but I am kind of ocd. These are beautiful, I just bought my second pack!"
"I purchased these a month ago and waited to write a review on them so I could really test them out. First off, the matte gold is perfect. I was nervous it would be too ‚Äúyellow gold‚Äù or too bronze. Nope, color is spot on. I also wanted to purchase a set that felt expensive ‚Äî this set has a weight to them so it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre about to break your fork when you eat AND feels luxury. Since I purchased I have hand washed and ran the set through the dishwasher. No tarnish, no flaking of the finish, no scratches. If water spots bother you, takes a simple towel shine. Highly recommend!"
"I love having gold silverware hehe. ^^  Only complaint I have is the balance of these. They're more weighted on the handle end compared to my other silverware, and so if you hold it in your mouth for a while they will start to poke the inside of your mouth. Not a huge deal but kinda annoying in that case."
"These came in a tiny little box I was surprised they got 40 pieces in there. They feel sturdy, like good, heavy quality. I noticed that they seemed slightly more silver than I was expecting. They‚Äôre still black but not as dark and not quite as matte as I thought. Still pretty though. I washed them and even wiped them on a white towel to check if any color came off. It didn‚Äôt. I will say that they show water marks really visibly so if you have a crappy dishwasher you might want to make sure they dry well. I couldn‚Äôt even really polish the water spots off. I went out and bought a finishing rinse to prevent water spots. Hopefully it works."
"I have had this flatware for about two months, and it's great! The knives, soup spoons, and dinner forks are big and have weight to them. I like holding them in my hand. I also like the teaspoons and salad forks. They are small and dainty, but they also have weight. I find it a pleasure to eat with all these pieces. They are in excellent condition. I noticed one tiny rust spot on one knife, but otherwise perfect. I'm very happy with this purchase."
I really like these. They have the right weight easy to clean no spots. I thought they were a great price. The Matte is a nice touch too. I bought three sets during a lightning sale. Well worth it.
I already get so many compliments on these!!! Love the unique look and very durable. They get washed in the dishwasher nearly every day and they‚Äôve been used for about 2 months and have held up super great! I will say you can see watermarks when they aren‚Äôt dried but that doesn‚Äôt bother most of the time that is easy enough to take care of.
I bought these for a picnic and given the price didn‚Äôt expect a lot as far as quality or strength but I was pleasantly surprised. The silverware is very sturdy -not like the cheap stamped stuff you sometimes get in less expensive restaurants. The color is a a true bright blue and after several washings has not faded or chipped a bit.
I can‚Äôt think of any reason someone would need black forks but they sure do look cool :) I just got them so I‚Äôll let you know if they fade or kill any of us with toxins
"Initially I was concerned about the black coating wearing off, but fast forward three years and they look the same as I got them. Well worth the price tag. The only gripe I have with them is that I bought 1 set originally then I bought more a couple months later and you can tell a difference in the coating between the two sets. Not that big of a deal as when they're lying on the table they all look the same."
"This is my second reorder. Somehow, the gremlins have lost spoons, and forks, but we have lots of the knives. I like the smoothness and the shape of the spoon bowls. A nice heft to the utensils and the sides and tines are polished no sharp edges. Very easy to clean and wipe to a polish. I don't use a dishwasher, so can't speak to that."
"I love the beautiful subtle color of the matte champagne. They look gorgeous next to my white dishes. I've put these through the dishwasher a couple times and it's been holding up great. I think the weight is perfect. Not too heavy and not too light. I have 12 sets for two of us, but I think I will order one more so there's plenty in the drawer for guests. I think it's priced decent at $39.99."
"I have built a custom kitchen, people take pride in kitchens and I do in mine. The set its a perfect addition and it match with the kitchen colors. The set came individually wrap, then have a nice weight on it that make feel like quality."
"Ordering another set because I love these so much. I've had them for 4-months now and they still look just as nice. I only use the dishwasher and noticed that if I use an off-brand dishwashing soap there are a lot of watermarks. However, when I use Cascade I do not have that problem. Highly recommend this product. It is a dupe for the flatware at Target that is double the price."
"When I first went to go buy these, I saw a few 1 star reviews saying these utensils weren't sturdy and the black coloring had chipped off. I was really trying to look for black utensils that would go well with my black and purple plate set, and the only place I could find anything black they were sold as single pieces and didn't come in a set. So I took the plunge and bought these and I love them.  I've been using them since November and they still look great, there hasn't been any chipping or discoloration. I think my only complaints are that you can see watermarks on them after drying and they aren't quite as black as in the pictures but they are still beautiful and worth it."
"This is a beautiful set, very distinctive looking and well designed. It is incredibly beautiful and the price is very reasonable.  I cannot speak to how durable this set is because I am saving it to use after a move. But I have heard from a youtuber that it is durable so I'm hoping that's the case."
"Good quality silverware. My husband loves the color black and when we moved and lost our silverware drawer, I decided to get fun with the silverware. Hard water is pretty apparent on black cutlery so just be prepared to hand wash again."
They have a good weight to them. They have a classic look and look much more expensive than they are. Great gift idea! They do look like the Magnolia ones at Target.
"Finally a black matte set that does NOT chip! Beautiful finish, sturdy, have a nice weight, and they don't chip! I was worried about using dishwasher based on another set and reviews of similar sets I have read. Our set has been in the dishwasher many MANY times and still look brand new!"
"I have bought a few sets of cutlery over the last year or so and have not been happy. they either feel cheap or the metal is cheap and rusts easily. These are the full size and weight you want, similar to something you would expect in a normal restaurant quality setting. i have not had them very long, but there are zero signs of wear thus far."
They're just like regular set but blue. They're holding up prefecture and I personally like the blue. The only draw back is 3 packs are needed to fulfill the needs of 5 family members
"I have had these for a month now, and they are absolutely beautiful. They look, feel, and appear high end but are completely bud jet friendly. Gorgeous set!"
"I have been using these for 2 months and they have not bent, faded or chipped. We put them in the dishwasher daily and they wash really well. The quality is competition for a very expensive set. I get so many compliments on them that I‚Äôm planning to replace all my silverware with a second set."
These matte gold place settings were perfect for my daughter‚Äôs bachelorette dinner. I put the in the dishwasher and there were no issues.
"Everyone I show them too thinks they're plastic at first, then I hand them one and they go, ""Oooh, I like that."" I love 'em. I haven't had a problem yet and they look really elegant. I have white dishes and a black dish drainer and a black and white kitchen so I have the black ones. They look nice even when not put away. They're kinda cool actually, I'm over the old style ""silverware."" These are so nice."
"I've always had the regular looking silverware in times past. This time, I went with the charcoal colored silverware. It goes well with my new dishes, glassware, and is a nice accent to the red apple decor that I have in my kitchen. I really love this silverware."
This is a nice addition to the utensils in my house! My family normally use the boring silver looking ones so I wanted to spice things up by ordering a black set of utensils. I feel much more cooler eating with these.
I received these as a wedding gift and absolutely love them. I have seen different reviews of different brands where people say they have placed them in the dishwasher and they have tarnished however these have held up wonderfully. Definitely worth the purchase.
We absolutely love this silverware! We had our eye on some black silver from target but it was only sold in a 5 packüò© so glad we looked around and found this üòç Great weight and doesn‚Äôt tarnish at a much more reasonable price!
I got this set for my son for Christmas and it is absolutely beautiful! I always watch my grandkids and seem to run out of silverware quickly so I thought I‚Äôd get another set for them he loved it so much he‚Äôs getting an additional set.
"I've used these several times and they are doing well. I love them, highly recommend Update: just bought a second set because I love them so much"
We were surprised how sturdy these were. My boyfriend was very impressed and the color is beautiful. We might order another set but in black next time. I put them in the dishwasher once when I first got them and they did well. Its really a great buy for a good price.
I don‚Äôt hesitate to commend this product. Pretty good quality. We use them everyday and I‚Äôd like to purchase more. First time to buy these type of utensils online and great that this item impress me.
"These feel so high quality and look so nice. I can‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher though since I have very hard water and they come out looking crazy with white spots, ugh lol. I just hand wash them but to me they‚Äôre worth the extra hand washing haha. I‚Äôm holding up a black plastic spoon in the picture to compare the color. Literally identical in color!!"
"These are absolutely gorgeous, feels heavier and very sturdy. I‚Äôve wash them a few times, both in the dishwasher and by hand and have not had any issues with color changes or scratches."
I love this cool gold silverware! It looks so classy and pretty. They're very well made and sturdy. It's easy to clean and they look great afterwards. We ordered two so it lasts for awhile. Love it!
"This silverware set is prefect, great weight, shape and size for all utensils, goes great with our kitchen aesthetic and dishware"
"This silverware is so beautiful and versatile. It fits perfectly with my dinnerware set, but would probably be suitable with many others, particularly modern designs. I like the matte finish and the fact that it cleans so easily. I bought a second set."
"Quality flatware for a good price! The matte black is a beautiful color, much better than was expected. I have run these through the dishwasher several times and have experienced no chips or fading yet. I love how there is also a matching serving set as well. I am very impressed!"
"As the title says, i love these for the color mostly, but they are actually sturdy and easy to clean which is a huge plus."
"I love the black flatware. Silver is plane, but the black i feel is unique without being flamboyant. The matte is perfect for these. The do end up with spots going through the dishwasher, so i tend to hand wash mine. But i love these so much!"
This blue ware is great. It matches my blue dishes and does not lose it's luster after washing. The only bad experience was when I went to order more they were out at the time. This tableware is worth the investment. I love mine.
"They look good and are made very nicely made. Sturdy, and pretty heavy weight. I have had them for months. The color has not faded. I do not have a dishwasher in my apartment so we hand wash these. So far so good."
"Nice solid silverware. We have two children and these go through the dishwasher daily. After over a year the color still holds up, although they do spot easily. We have zero complaints, especially for the price."
If you love dark stuff or just love being unusual this is for you. Obviously after A LOT of washing it starts to fade but it takes a long while.
I love way this flatware has held up!! I have had it for approximately 2 months. It is used daily there is zero tarnishing!! Each piece still looks brand new!!
"I buy myself a lot of stuff. I have iPads and computers, all kinds of devices and junk. But for a few years now I‚Äôd get ice cream and my spoon would bend. Terrible right? ‚ÄúWhy you got a iPad and cheap silverware ‚Äú idk. But I fixed it. I made myself some ice cream and my new spoon didn‚Äôt bend. When I made myself a grilled cheese the other day I didn‚Äôt have to search high and low for a knife they were just there. This is such a simple thing that I‚Äôd been neglecting for years. You need it. Buy it"
"I didn't need anything fancy, just standard day-to-day utensils, and these certainly do the trick. They seem to be good quality and I like that the set came with steak knives. So far we are happy with them! One small thing, be careful because the tines on the forks are sharp!"
"I* like everything about this set of flatware, including as a bonus, 4 quality sharp carving knives that I use everyday just as cutting knives for fruits, veggies or other things needing a good clean cut! And the butter knives are also so pleasantly wide and flat that I no longer need a special knife just for spreading butters or jellies etc,,!"
"One other buyer commented on the size and found them uncomfortable. I don't think so. They are well balanced. There was also a comment about the chamfer on the ends digging into one's hands. I really don't see how that's possible either with long handles. I was brought up to hold a utensil with the fingertips and thumb, not palm it. Very nice looking set, simple and elegant. If you want 'dainty' though, this is not it."

Shockingly this is a pretty sturdy set. Would definitely recommend
"Este juego de cubiertos me encantaron, por el valor que pagu√©, fue mas de lo que esperaba. Los recomiendo mucho."
This set was a gift that the recipient enjoys. I liked the fact that it also contained steak knives as well as butter knives.
Wouldn‚Äôt expect such good quality for such an inexpensively price product. I have only had this set for a few days but so far I am happy with my purchase.
"Really nice quality, thick and heavy. Bought it for my AirBnB. Quality set of flatware. Steak knives are what you'd find in a good steak house!"
I ready did love this product. I even ordered 2 sets. Really nice. Good quality and very fast shipping. Thank you!
"Very happy with this set. I bought it because the set included cutting sharp knives, not just butter knives. Good buy!"
"Metal doesn‚Äôt really hold its structure too much but it bends back. for the price, its pretty good. other small downside is that the knifes metal is slightly above the handle"
This is my 2nd set....my daughter is moving into her first apartment and she loved mine so I purchased hers. They keep a great shine after washing and I love the big spoons and small forks.
Just your basic set of flatware. Good quality set for inexpensive price. Pretty good steak knifes included.
"Buen producto, buena presentaci√≥n y calidad"
Basic silverware but has nice weight to it and I will probably get another set
The silverware is very nice sturdy and it looks very elegant the set is really worth the money I was not disappointed!!!!!
Good value for the money. Especially with the included steak knives.
Pleasantly surprised Love this set Very good quality
"Got for my mother in law as a Christmas gift and all silverware is still in great shape. Easy to clean, sturdy, and no chipping away of the pieces."
"Sturdy, easy to clean, great price. I am very satisfied."
Pretty good for price. But spoons and forks are quite sharp on the edges and cut my inner cheek while eating. Sliced it right open!
"I bought this set for my son, & when we opened the box I loved this set of silverware so much that I ordered another for myself!"
The flatware set was exactly as ordered. The qualit is impressive and it lays well on the table.
This set is lightweight without feeling like cheap restaurant silverware - perfect for our camper.
The silverware is very pretty and sturdy. Even the steak knives seem to be of great quality!
Nothing is wrong with these even with daily heavy duty dishwashing.
"Great value. Nice-looking, good weight and size."
Perfect for replenishing my silverware collection.
"Good value for money, nothing fancy just simple silverware and they feel like they will last a while"
Good quality for the price.
"Good set, all in place"
Excelente producto 100% recomendado.
Made to last
They work. Good. Cheap. Fast shipping
I am shocked by the price and the quality of the utensils!! Amazing buy!! When they arrived they were all separately packaged and ounce I pulled them out of the bag she shininess of the product wow!! So nice!
Needed a new set of silverware for new apartment and bigger quantity of utensils to have on hand for guests.
Good
Gift for Grandson
Like it all
Couldn't be more pleased with these utensils!!
I was surprised at the quality of these. Great purchase. Heavier than I expected and well made.
"Heavy, but the kind that means long lasting, not weight wise. Very sturdy, nice set."
Perfect for me. The small forks and small spoons are smaller than I expected. Thoroughly enjoyed so far.
This silverware was delivered within 24 hours at a reasonable price. It is a quality product and I recommend it.
I bought this set for my daughter for Christmas. They were much heavier and better than the sets you see in the store that cost way more. It was an added plus they came with sharp steak knives as well. She was very happy with them!
"Very sturdy silverware. All individually wrapped one receiving. Very easy to clean, great value."
It‚Äôs an amazing price for what you get. I‚Äôm going to order another set!
Love the size differences. Very sturdy wash great too.
Good product at a good price
"I like it just fine, thxs üòÅüëç"
The quality was so good! I didn‚Äôt expect it to be so nice and sturdy. I haven‚Äôt cleaned them yet but I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôre easy to clean
Have had no problems with this silver ware. Good quality for an affordable price.
Like
They are great use them every day now for a month
Perfect for what we needed at the office Fantastic price great quality.
I love how sturdy they are and the amount I got for such a great price.
Easy to care for
Good value for the money.
Love the silverware minus the steak knives. One wash in the dishwasher and the knives look like they have rust on them. But the other pieces have held up nicely - hoping the steak knives are just a fluke!
"Easy to hold, and extremely sturdy. A great buy!"
Good product
Nice quality set. Nice price too.
Like everything from sturdiness to the value
Great price and Quality I would totally buy it again.
Great quality
worked great and good value
It took a while to arrive but it was certainly worth the wait! Great product for a great price.
"I‚Äôve washed the set twice and so far it hasn‚Äôt tarnished nor has it bent or anything. Pretty good product, especially for the price!"
"Got tired of looking at my mismatched everyday flatware so I bought this. I am very pleased. They are plain, straight and not fancy pieces, but they have a nice weight and feel balanced in my hand. They are nice and shiny and look really good in a place setting. The size of the knives is perfect for spreading butter on that toast and the spoons and forks are also nicely sized. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase. If the Queen is coming to dinner, you probably wouldn't want to use this flatware, but for everyday family use this is durable and perfect."
"I bought a second set since I was so pleased with the first one. The spoons don‚Äôt bend if you‚Äôre scooping ice cream so that‚Äôs a huge plus in my book. Also, if you don‚Äôt have a dish washer, like me, you will appreciate the fact that the water marks are minimal if left to air dry. They can easily be wiped with a towel to make them shine!"
""
"I really like this set for the affordable price, sample in design, but functional with comfortable hands, knifes cuts well and spoons can hold enough amount of liquid. they're not too big though. The items can not be bent by your curious little ones."
"I LOVE this set. I was missing a few pieces of my old set so decided to renew and love them so far. These clean up just as nice as they did when I bought them, I have hand washed and dishwashed and they come out nice, maintaining color and shine.  I find these to be a good value so far and by how they are fairing I expect to have then for a while"
"Love the smooth designs and very easy to clean and polished. It's a quality made and probably double the thickness from what I have/had. 40 PCS weighted almost feels like 60PCS. Therefore, it should be shipped/packaged inside a box but not a thin envelope. The product box gets damaged a bit on the top and small cracks in the bottom. Suggestion to the seller/manufacturer: Double the thickness of product packaging material to minimize the damages from the shipping and handling."
Awesome quality silverware set I wanted something that I could replace the old silver this set was perfect piece very easy to clean great price very durable and worth more then what I paid for them
Satisfied with the product. The utensils have a nice premium feel.
"I searched all over on Amazon for a nice cutlery set. I originally wanted a black matte set but settled on these and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I have washed them multiple times in the dishwasher (we have hard water) no water spots, no peeling of any sort, and no rust. Still so shiny."
"Just received my order a day ago. Seems like a nice set, a little lighter than I prefer but all in all appears to be a nice sturdy set for the price."
This is a very solid set of silverware. The set is large enough for a family and guests. Comes clean easily in the dishwasher. The pieces look very nice as well.
"This silverware is nicely weighted, great size and has a lovely shine. Excellent price."
"Wow, impressed as to the smooth, elegant and large matching set of silverware. Even arrived early. Can't wait for company..."
This flatware will most likely last 25-30 years.z
Love the set.....beautiful to use daily
Awesome!!
Great buy! Highly recommended
Sturdy and easy to clean
This flatware set is very durable and clean cut‚Ä¶you get a great bang for your buck‚Ä¶ I highly recommend and will probably be buying a second set just to have more quantity!
Perfect starter set for anyone who likes to entertain.
The flatware is high quality at a fantastic price! Very pleased.
They have a clean and timeless look.
"Shipped quickly, boxed really easy and product is excellent."
"Love this starter set , easy to hold , easy to clean it up ."
"So far so good. I like how shiny they are. Dishwasher safe. I always use a dishwasher and they have been safe with the use. So far no rust,which was a big factor when looking for a purchase. The quality seems good. They're not flimsy but not thick and heavy like fine dining. I'd say they're like in between type. I like the 2 different size spoon and fork options. I like a smaller fork but big spoon to eat with. The larger spoon is big. Even a bit bigger than I'm used to. The smaller fork is good for me as I still have never used the big fork yet. Overall seems a good buy. I'd purchase again."
"I love the sleek design, feel good in my gags, wash great, sturdy and stays shiny with washing. I gave 4 stars because I don‚Äôt like the size of the large spoons. I cant use the large spoons for eating, the are too wide and big to fit in my mouth. Not sure what i can use the large ones for, maybe I will find a purpose in time."
"I just got the flatware today. The weight is lighter then I anticipated, except for the knives. And the large spoons are too large, almost serving spoon size. The teaspoons are not teaspoon size. They are larger. Because the larger spoons are almost serving size spoons, I returned it."
love it
Packaging was falling apart on arrival. Ordered two sets and one was missing the knives. Had to get a refund for one set and re-order. So far so good. Have run three dishwasher loads and the utensils came out fine.
Use them when I run out of silverware..
I was very disappointed in the quality of the set it certainly marks a change in Amazon orders. Before you can expect better quality when you ordered from Amazon
Ed
"Lighter, thinner and lower quality than I hoped for."
Pretty expensive and cheap quality
Its a good quality spoon set. feels perfect in your hand. Its easy washable and didn't lose its shine.
Love them and looks like they will last a long time.
Looks just as described. I loved this set and it is very nice and shiny
"I have been searching for a nice silverware set on Amazon for a long time to replace my current set. I came cross with this product. The design looks nice and the price is affordable, so I decided to give it a try. I received the product rapidly. However, the box damaged a little bit because shipper packed the item poorly. I opened the box and found the silverware are made of high quality material and looked very shiny. I cleaned them by using dishwasher and there was no residue on the surface-very easy to clean! I will overall recommend you to give this set a try."
Great value for your money
they look very quality
"Very sturdy, I like these silverwear set. The sizes are perfect fit in my utensil holder properly, and it is very easy to clean. Way better than my previous ones. Really happy with them! Highly recommend to get them."
To be honest these are bad quality. They don't feel sturdy and scratched from every day are very noticeable.
Simple yet beautiful designed silverware. It‚Äôs also surprisingly solid. The silverware is not bendable and you can see it‚Äôs going to last a long time. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for simple and contemporary silverware that isn‚Äôt going out of trend.
"As described! Simple and pretty, and nicer/more-formal than the ones from Ikea. And great customer service!"
"Just as described, just received it a few days ago. Looks pretty good to me."
"These were perfect for my girlfriend and me. If you have 3 people, you may wanna get more if you care to use only the big utensils. We have been hand washing them. so I'm not sure of your experience with the machines."
"I have been needing a good set of affordable silverware for quite awhile. I have looked at all the normal department stores and of course found my best deal here. This set is sturdy feeling, it isn't a cheap feeling piece of silverware at all! It feels as though you have paid twice what these are priced at. I have run them through the dishwasher a bunch of times and they still look as though they did when I first opened them! The normal dinner forks are large enough , to get a good size bite out of and the salad forks are a perfect size. The teaspoons are a decent size, perfect for cereal and/or soup. I will say that the tablespoons are a little large , yet still plenty usable. I am planning on getting another set before our next family gathering. The price is amazing for the quality that you are getting for these! Highly recommend!"
"Love this set , easy to hold , was easy to clean it up."
Im very sad. Started the return. Only 4 days used. Rust on most.
18/10 stainless my arse! This garbage flatware rusted severely THE FIRST TIME it was washed. Caveat emptor.
"The knives are not 18/10, they are 13/0 says it on the knives. Hence the rust reviewers ate complaining about."
"This is a beautifully simple design, with a nice heft. The soup spoons are a tad larger than I like but I have decayed soup spoons so it‚Äôs okay. (I‚Äôm weird about soup spoons). 180/10 chromium to nickel rating is supposed to be excellent for flatware. I just received them and we‚Äôve just used them once so I can‚Äôt rate durability. Can I just say the finish is perfect for casual or more elegant seatings and the simplicity of design- that is, no design, is perfect for any taste. The VALUE is beyond- looks a lot more expensive than it was. If your table needs a ‚Äúlift‚Äù, this is perfect. ‚ù§Ô∏èLove‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Beautiful set, would definitely buy again."
These are gorgeous!! And I like them even better than the WMF ones we used to have!! Highly recommended! Feels great in the hand and have a good weight to it. Looks and feels more expensive than it was. Packaging is not super fancy but I would have loved to receive this as a wedding gift etc too!
"During a long distance relocation, I got rid of most of my household items and had to repurchase at the other end, so I went for economy. This flatware was the least expensive on Amazon and I'm very pleased. Would have liked iced tea spoons, but that's okay. Strongly recommend."
We needed these bad. My children have a habit of throwing away all of the silverware when they put their plates in the trash. So i bought these. Smart and not so smart now some are missing. Im going to hide the rest and only use for holidays lol its a really nice set though
"These are legit 18/10 stainless, otherwise know as 304L stainless. I scanned 10 random utensils with an XRF scanner in my lab and all were about the same. Attached is a picture where I ground into one about 1/16"" of an inch and scanned it, to make sure it wasn't somehow clad with a thin layer of 304. Everyone saying these aren't 18/10 needs to check their dishwasher for bare steel that would be causing rust."
For the price it‚Äôs unreal how amazing these are. Nice and heavy. Not like school cafeteria silverware. I would recommend these to everyone.
I expected this product to be ‚Äòcheap‚Äô because of the price but I was pleasantly surprised. This silverware has a good weight to it and they are larger in size compared to the cheap ones with plastic handles that I had. I‚Äôm very happy with this set.
Sturdy beautiful and nice weight in hand -would purchase again!
"Excellent weight and size even for us (in our 70's) They have been through the diswasher at least 20 times and look brand new. I ordered 2 sets of ""service for 8"" because I wanted two sets of the serving pieces and at least service for 12. I highly recommend this flatware."
This is perfect! I got them for my daughter and sil for their 20th anniversary. I live with them... they didn't have much silverware. That is very heavy duty. They will last a lifetime. Thank u
I just moved to an apartment and needed to outfit the entire unit. This flatware was a great addition.
Knives are ‚Äúrusting‚Äù within 4 weeks. Not usable. Do not buy.
Was really impressed with the quality upon arrival.  However...  The review about rusting is absolutely correct.  Rusted first use. Makes no sense. Stuff from the dollar store doesn‚Äôt rust like this garbage.
Beautiful set of flatware. Heavy duty and durable with a sleek simple design. I love the sizes of each item and they are simple but still classy.
Great every day silverware. I like this set.
"I will admit these are pretty heavy since it's stainless steel and very thick. Personally, I like it but some of you may want something thinner.  The only damage any of the utensils have taken so far is when I dropped a spoon into a working garbage disposal. A few cuts into the edge of the spoon but nothing sharp."
Very sturdy. Feels like you have something in your hand that won't bend.
"These are absolutely beautiful. They have the look of hand-crafted, hammered pieces. But they are also elegant and durable. I‚Äôm in love with them."
Great flatware set for the value. Butter knives and forks are even sharp!! Beautiful art on the handles! Great idea if you need more flatware!
"Very nice sturdy silverware set. I haven‚Äôt had/used the set long enough to determine how long it will last, but no rusting so far."
"I cannot believe the price I got these for! They are very sturdy and thick, no rough edges and wash easily. Love the brushed metal look as well."
Totally like the product. Very simple and elegant design. Adds a certain flavor to the meals.
I love this silverware. I ended up coming back and got more for my adult children. They are beautiful and heavy weight.
"Bought on a deal of the day deal, so price was awesome! Loved the set, except for the knives which were not 18/10 like the rest of the pieces, which other customers had stated in their reviews. We just used the knives we already had that were 18/10 and not the ones that came with it. Otherwise the look and feel was nice, just what we were looking for!"
These were a requested gift. Sturdy. Sleek. Simple design to compliment anything.
"Like some others, the knives have started rusting where Stone and Beam is embossed in the blade. Sending back as I've had this set for less than a month. Cannot be 18/10. stainless. Will try a replacement set and see if they last a bit longer.  Returned and Amazon replaces them without issue. Replacement set is rusting worse than the first set. Going to work on getting Amazon to replace this set, too. Kind of disappointing cause the set has a nice weight and size to it."
So far they are great!!!! Love them!
Heavy weighted and beautiful design... real quality.... great value for the monwy spent
What a great item. Way better than I expected.
Washed them left to dry And they rusted NOT GOOD AT ALL üòí
Very nice weight. Good value for the price and would buy again.
good quality and heavy pieces. very happy.
"This silverware is great, I loved it so much that I ordered the second set"
Good set for great price
"Nice set, very shiny."
"When it came time to retire my IKEA silverware, I was skeptical about spending a hundred dollars for adult looking silverware but these were best of both worlds!"
good
Loved these.
Very solid pieces. Great price.
Great silverware.
Very good price abd good quality
absolutely love the set. My order came in short 1 spoon but for the price I paid and quality of the silverware I didn't care that much.
"No dislikes, well made, good value."
"I really like them! And, at the cost I paid...they were a steal! The weight is very, very nice! And they have a lovely finish!"
This flatware is gorgeous. It has a good weight in your hand and doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. Very glad I purchased it!
Love them
Very elegant. I like it. It's not lightweight though.
They are very durable and strong
Purchased this set for my beach house- only to discover they are much nicer than I expected- so I kept for everyday.
"very heavyweight flatware,"
Great value for the $$$$$
"I love this silver ware it‚Äôs the best that I have ever had. Thank you very much for your wonderful product, I would recommend this to all of my friends and family."
Ordered this for our vacation home and was very surprised that they're so sturdy! Very pleased.
Like very much.
"Replaced my (many years old) Flatware set and chose a little more expensive one. Purchased this set and it was delivered Jan 5th. Now the knives are rusting/tarnished. My return window closed Feb 4th and so am not able to return the set. Pretty disappointed! These are not the most expensive since I planned to use them for just everyday but I did expect them to last more than 5 weeks. Description clearly states: ""Durable stainless steel will outlast many trips through the dishwasher"" and ""Durable material Made of 18/10 stainless steel and available in a variety of finishes and trims, our silverware sets are durable as well as elegant. Rust resistant and dishwasher safe for everyday use and easy clean up.."" Would not recommend at all! UPDATE: After speaking with a customer service agent Amazon did approve return and refunded my money."
"Was hoping that maybe Amazon would have addressed all the complaints about the knives, so I took a shot. Right off the bat I noticed the knives were stamped with ""13/0"" while everything else was ""18/10"". Put them in the dishwasher and the knives has rust spots after that first wash. Disappointed that Amazon would misrepresent their own products like this. These will be returned."
Love silverware. Great for a first home starting out.
So I have to start out stating i was rather disappointed that it only came with one butter dish knife. I ordered this set thinking it would have multiple but it did not. That being said I‚Äôm quite impressed with this silverware set. It‚Äôs sturdy and they‚Äôre easy to clean. I never really thought that silverware was worth spending money on so we always had the super cheap ones from Walmart. However now I see why folks spend a bit more on silverware than I typically do.
Very durable and easy to clean
"This is a nice, quality set of flatware with just the right amount of weight to it for both casual and holiday dinners. The brushed silver has a low sheen, elegant look that goes way beyond the price of the set. I ordered a 45-piece and then ordered the second 45-piece when I saw how nice it is. With several ""rust issue"" reviews that deal mostly with the knives, I'm hopeful that they (as well as the rest of the set!) hold up, as I really love it so far. UPDATE: Flatware has been used for multiple dinners and everyday use, gone through dishwasher many times, and comes out spotless and has shown no sign of rusting."
Solid thickness and look great
"These were on sale so I figured why not? Amazon usually makes good products from my past experience with trying some of them and when these arrived they looked nicer in person. I quickly went to the knives and the previous reviews are correct they are not 18/10 all the rest are but just not the knives!? Weird but for this price it was a great deal, so I got another set for my son and told him to hand wash the knives (dishwasher use bleach which I think causes the rust issues) and he said np, he hardly uses butter knives anyways. So be forewarned regarding the butter knives, if in the future they correct this issue it will be an even better value, but for now it still is a good deal when they go on sale."
"This silverware was nice and sturdy - pretty heavy, which is great! I bought it for a wedding gift, and when I unboxed it, I was very tempted to keep it for my own family's use. Very nice quality!"
"Honestly I bought this when I accidentally clicked the buy now button. I have been shopping / looking around for a new set of flatware for quite some time and was very seriously considering a set from Crate & Barrel. When I accidentally bought these I decided to let them arrive and see what they‚Äôre like. The size is okay, a bit bigger and heavier would be better. My husband is a big guy with big hands and he likes to have something substantial to hold onto when using flatware. As far as the appearance goes I think they‚Äôre kind of cheap or tacky looking. The little design at the bottom of the flatware is good and would have been just enough decoration but they decided to add a rope texture all the way around the sides. This is the part I dislike. Not classy, simple, or clean looking. I plan on returning these this week. For this amount of money I have to have something I love."
"I could not believe that these silverware would be any good based on the price I was getting them for. I bought them anyway because I needed silverware badly and there were quite a few pieces in this set, so I figured I could just throw pieces out as they got rusty or whatever. Turns out, I just happened to be extremely lucky in that I found these when they were during a huge discounted sale. They look fantastic and feel great in your hand. I haven't yet experienced any rusting on the knives and I've even had these sit in water for a few days. I will say that they tend to dry spotty. I hand wash all my dishes and let them air dry. If spots really bother you, I would suggest drying these with a towel after washing."
"I just got this flatware this week, so I can't yet attest to its sturdiness overtime. However, it feels good in the hand, well balanced for chasing pasta around the plate. It has a nice, clean, simple look to it which will go with pretty much every kind of place setting. And it washes easily, due to the lack of decorative stamping or etching. Really quite pleased, especially as I got them at a sale price. I suspect I got a steal of a deal."
Love this set! We have company over and my 20 price set wasn‚Äôt cutting it. I‚Äôve run these through the dishwasher about 30 times since I‚Äôve had them and they are holding up nicely no scratches like my other set
These are such great value for their price. They work well and I haven‚Äôt experienced any rusting or weird edges. I would definitely buy these again!
So for the price and how much you get they are great. It‚Äôs what made me want to buy them. But they arrived scratched and although it‚Äôs not the biggest deal but it does make them look cheap if you really pay attention. This is just out of the box so I‚Äôm worried about how much they will scratch after using them in general. But if you‚Äôre looking for cheap silverware they are still usable out the box.
A pretty nice and value for the money you spend these are fairly good quality for the price I was expecting them to band easy but they hold their shape they're really a good deal
You get what you pay for. Need a bunch of new silverware go for it don't have to worry about kids messing up these ones. Kids keep bending spoons on ice cream.
"I was doubtful for the price. Wonderful bright, shiny, Nice balance and weight! so far I have sold another on it. My teens each ""barrowed"" from my old silver it was past time to get a new set. Truly love them even after using them a bit!"
I had the cheap Walmart silverware that rusts and plastic silverware until I saw the price of this was basically the same as the cheap Walmart silverware. In the past I paid over 5xs more for less pieces. And as it is stainless steel it shouldn't rust.
So very pleased with this product! Very good quality! Would definitely buy again!
"This product exceeded my expectations. Quality, durability, dishwasher safe."
Good for everyday use. The utensils have some weight which is nice and they are finished off well.
Good set with good weight to each piece and sleek design. They work well and are a fraction of the cost for what you get compared to other utensils.
Love this product. Use them everyday. Wish I had known about them sooner. Definitely recommendable.
I chose these because of the smooth transition from the handle to the blade or to the tines or to the bowl of the spoon. It is so much easier to keep these clean than those that have sharp corner or edge there.
Wanted a set for my RV works great uniform feel well made
Awesome value for the price. We are a family of 5 so we need a lot of quality pieces that didn‚Äôt break the budget. This works perfect.
"Great price and best price I might add that I could find in stores and on Amazon, perfect number and set!"
Very beautiful will surely will recommend it
Great deal for the price
Great
I told you I liked it.
This silverware was great for the price! Do not seem cheap at all. They are very sturdy!
I like the size
A good purchase its value is awesome
"Nice weight, easy to hold,"
Very sturdy set. Looks great.
These utensils are sturdy and of great quality. Very happy with purchase.
Great quality.
Love them!
Pleasantly surprised at the quality!
Loved them as soon as I pulled out of box. Light weight. Simplistic.
Light but sturdy flatware. Great for travel and outdoor use rather tan plastic flatware.
These are a little bigger than my others but very nice quality and lots of pieces. Seems like we keep losing forks so i hope we dont lose these. lol
Everything is as expected
Good value for the money. Needed an extra set because with kids in the house my utensils kept disappearing üôÖ. So far sturdy and good quality. Very happy with this purchase.
Good quality for the price
Good value
"Sturdy, worth the cost, simple design"
"This silverware I b have ordered is for everyday use. Very, very sarisfied with quality.  Thank you Barbara Cotter"
Very good just as indicated
Look good
"Great set, great price, much nicer than expected."
"This set is a keeper!!! Nice and heavy, so comfortable and smooth. Might just have to buy another ‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£"
The silverware set is excellent especially for the money. It is nice and bright. Sturdy and the structure is easily held with hands.
They lasted so far and I'm happy.
"This set is beautiful & high quality. A great value, exactly what I needed!"
I like that they
Balanced and comfortable to hold
I absolutely liked the product.
Fast and perfect for what I need
Very good quality
Great pieces well made for the price
Good silverware at a good price
Love the quality for a low price.
I recommend this product at 100%
Great price sturdy and enough for the whole family.
Solid set for the price. There is not a huge difference between the size of the small and big spoons. The small spoons are definitely not teaspoons. Not a big deal though.
"Rusted the very first time it was run through the dishwasher! I have included a couple photos, but these are not the only pieces that rusted - many more did as well. I am extremely dissappointed."
"Very nice flatware. Surdy, nice finsh and appropriate size. I knocked down one star category due to incorrect order. Too many small forks and not the right amount of small spoons. Amazon had this corrected right away and order is complete. Make sure you count all pieces when they arrive."
Got them for a wedding gift
Very nice set and not pricey.
"Great product, great price! They feel very expensive, and don‚Äôt tarnish!"
"I loved these spoons, very sturdy (they do not bend) and so many for a great price!"
Wasn't great quality
Very please with the quality and value of this silverware.
These appear to be solid pieces of flatware. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Each piece came in an individual plastic sleeve. A pain to unpack and wasteful.
"The item itself is pretty good, looks as is advertised in the picture and they all come individually wrapped which is good because it avoids scratches during shipment but the package to the item was poor and before I even opened the box they were spilling out of its original package into the shipping box. Too many heavy items for such flimsy original packaging. Other than that though the item itself is good and is as advertised."
"This set is super original which I loved. However, after only a few months, it‚Äôs already rusted on half the pieces. Most of the spoons are rusted and a lot of forks in between the spikes. Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get ahold of the seller. But super sad. I won‚Äôt be purchasing again or suggest it to others due to what happened with my set."
The flatware in this set seems to be made of poor quality. A number of pieces are tarnished when simply opening the package and they will not shine. VERY DISAPPOINTED  We returned this set and ordered another.  John J Hogan
"These are a value for the money. A little light for my taste, I like a little heavier"
The quality of this product is good for the price. However the large spoons and small spoons have the same size bowl. It may have said that in the description but I was used to a smaller spoon having a smaller bowl so I was disappointed in that manner.
"Honestly not sure why it‚Äôs necessary to spend more than this on a cutlery set! I was worried these would be lightweight and seem flimsy for the price but they‚Äôre not and they feel perfect to use, look good, and no issues. So far I‚Äôve hand washed and used in the dishwasher - the instructions do say to clean and dry to avoid rusting but I‚Äôve never had that as an issue with cutlery. I‚Äôll update if necessary!"
"Order just arrived, unpacked, and ate my first meal. Packaging was as good as it gets, with individual utensils sheathed in plastic. I especially like the size of the small fork and spoon. The finish on the set I bought years ago from IKEA has dulled. The finish on the new set is a mirror finish that I assume will dull over the years. For my purposes the set is perfect, a good value for a product."
"I was nervous to order because of the previous reviews, but have had no issues with them rusting. We bought them months ago and am writing this review because we‚Äôre ordering more. Our toddler throws them away sometimes because he‚Äôs learning clean up his spot at the table!"
"These are fabulous, for the price especially! They're decently heavy & don't have any sharp edges. My only complaint is that the teaspoons are about the same size as my tablespoons, & the tablespoons are much bigger.. Closer to the size of a serving spoon. But other than that I'm quite happy with these!"
"I definitely made a good purchase, I honestly thought it was goin to be a cheap material because of the price , but it‚Äôs the best utensils I bought, I like the fact it comes in different sizes , also the material is very very good , nothing cheap . I made a second purchase for my sister‚Äôs new home and they loved it ."
"I was desperately in need of silverware, so decided to order this set. I am very pleased with it. It‚Äôs beautiful and serves the purpose for what it‚Äôs intended for. Also, the price was right! Highly recommend!"
I never would have expected this quality from an inexpensive set. Was impressed and shocked how nice they were
I now have a couple sets of this silverware. They keep their shine and do not rust or spot. Very good value.
"Great bang for your buck. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect at the awesome price, but I was more than impressed."
"Surprisingly good quality for the price. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this set, but thus far they seem sturdy. I‚Äôve had then for 2+ months and have yet to get any noticeable scratches or chips. Great buy for the price point!"
I wanted to get rid of my old utensils since they were made with more than one part which after years led to rust. These are great one piece silverware that won't rust if left in the sink too long.
These were bought for our camper and worked out perfectly.
Muy buenos! Recomendables y de una sola pieza
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èVery good item to have and use
I'm so excited to have this set of beautiful silverware and at such a reasonable price. They feel very sturdy and durable and I expect to use them for many years to come. So far have been great to use and cleaned up easily!
"These are so great for someone starting off in a new place. The ""big"" spoons are a little big, so I use them as serving spoons. Other than that, I love them."
"Sturdiness, price, size of set"
I wasn't expecting this quality because it was such and inexpensive silver set. But I'm glad I got them and would buy again.
The spoons were too big for your mouth and forks were to long but if it‚Äôs your first set it‚Äôs not too bad!
To think at this price this is real stainless steel my new granddaughter in-law is going to love this I packed it in my suitcase for my trip to the wedding
None
The utinsels were individually wrapped. They have a nice weight to them. They also have a nice sheen to them. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase.
"Better than advertised regarding appearance, sturdiness‚Äî good in dishwasher too"
"Really sturdy, great quality no sharp edges and ao far no stains. Great value for the price."
"Perfect if you're just looking for some extra utensils at a good price, and not trying to impress anybody...or maybe they would! They've been holding up in the dishwasher for weeks."
Great set. Feels quality for the great value.
Grandson & his new wife loved them. It was on their registry
the packaging is very compact and they are sturdy and clean. great purchase
These replaced a similar 4 piece setting that I never liked because the pieces were so heavy. This setting has a very nice weight. Just what I wanted!
Great utensils for the price. So shiny and sturdy And a variety.
The eating utensil and the color is excellent
Reasonable cost. Attractive silverware. Satisfied with the item.
left in the sink a couple of times and still can be shined clean. good balance on them
"Good, leaves water marks easy but if you dry with a tea towel it stays nice"
Does what is needed
Awful product. After a month of using them I had to throw them away. They smell like metal. Very disappointed
Good quality
Loved the silverware. Good value.
"Excellent weight, polished and good mouth appeal. Well worth the price."
Purchased for my rental apt great weight and finish for the price
Nice set for the price a must buy if need
Good quality
for the money nice and sturdy I like you will not be disappointed
I love these! They are very sturdy and stay shiny like they are brand new each time they are washed.
Excellent quality.
I love my silverware. It‚Äôs very trendy.
Good quality item at a good price.
Very nice looking
they feel expensive and look so nice. absolutely great for the price
"Product made from good material, works perfectly."
It's worth the price
"Used item for eating cereal, serving spoon."
Great Product
Nice set!
Perfect set!
"I liked the design and the weight of them but I had to send them back. The bigger spoons were way too big to use practically, leaving you with only the 4 smaller spoons which are too small for soup/cereal. On top of that, about 90% of the forks had sharp burrs/imperfections on the ends of the tines."
These are very thick and shinny and appear to be good quality. Then after a few washes they tarnish badly! Already after a month I am throwing them out.
"The only issue I had with this item, once I got it I read the paperwork which tells me they can't stay in water/ be damp for any length of time...other than that I like the purchase. Haven't encountered any issues as of yet."
"These are great for the need of utensils, but keep in mind that these are not some high end long lasting item. They have been great in washes and no issue whatsoever. But they feel a bit light and bendable. Recommended for the price range and quantity provided."
"This silverware set is pretty, yet durable. The pieces are lightweight and sturdy. I‚Äôve only owned this set for a few weeks and I‚Äôve washed the pieces in the dishwasher with no issues. So far, so good!"
These spot SO easily no matter how quickly you dry them out of the dishwasher. Once they spot it‚Äôs so hard to get off. They were super cheap so some issues are to be expected. Otherwise really nice looking silverware.
"This is a decent silverware set with a decent weight for the price. Unfortunately, one of my small forks was already bent when I got it. It was packaged well and the box was fine without dents, so I guess it came from the manufacturer like that. It's still a good set considering what you pay for it."
"Heavier than expected, pleasant surprise. Little scratches on a few but not bad. Great price"
Great set and good value for the money. I needed to supplement my existing silverware and this was more than enough. Recommended.
They are pretty good but must be dried as soon as washed. It is mentioned on the box.
"These look good , but are lightweight and feel kinda cheap. Ok for just basic silverware but nothing great, but for the price they are ok."
Good for the money
All silverware was good except one fork that was not fixable. Bummed because we needed the forks for sure
Set is nice quality but the tips of the forks are like DAGGERS.
I like the product but table spoon is huge
I bought this set based on the positive reviews. I could not be any happier. They are heavy in the hand and well balanced and feel as though they will outlast me. They are used daily and are washed after sitting in the sink until I run out of spoons and put in the dishwasher almost every other day. I have had them about 2 months now and they are still looking new. I already ordered another set to be used in my other house and am considering yet another smaller set for the RV. I could not be happier and recommend this heavy duty flatware set. I ordered a ‚Äúused like new‚Äù set as a second set but this set of flatware arrived and had no larger spoons included. I contacted Amazon and they sent me another new set the very next day at no cost. Thank you Amazon. Buy with confidence.
"These are very nice. smooth edges with a nice feel in the hand. The set of 12 just means there are lots of forks and spoons to go around for us as my kids could care less which size they get. The finish seems excellent. So far they've been through the dishwasher a couple dozen times without issue. So far we are very, very happy with this silverware set."
I purchased this flatware for a vacation rental property. These utensils are heavy and elegant. They withstand continuous dishwashing and continue to look new. We liked these so much that we purchased additional sets for our home. DefinItely recommend!
I am very satisfied with my silverware. It is very sturdy and smooth and does not hurt my fingers. I am a diabetic with sore fingers from finger sticks.
"This silverware is really nice and substantial! Very affordable. Easy to clean. I‚Äôm a bit of a silverware snob. After reading reviews I decided I will give it a shot. Much to my surprise, it‚Äôs heavy, sturdy and pretty! I may get another service for 12!"
The heavier utensils were recommended as a help with my tremors. They helped by keeping needing a firmer grip on the utensils. Great styling
"After being disappointed with multiple sets of silverware, I am happy to report that this set is perfect. Each piece is a substantial weight. The knives are serrated and can cut meat easily. They wash beautifully. It‚Äôs just a perfect set! I‚Äôm so happy I ordered them!!"
"This seems like nice, sturdy silverware! I don't think my husband will be able to bend the spoons scooping ice cream like he did with the cheap old stuff I replaced!ü•¥"
"If you need everyday dinnerware buy this set. High gauge stainless steel. Elegant, no tacky design. Excellent value. Dinner knife is serated and the steak knives very sharp. I left 6 place setting in my kitchen drawer and placed the other 6 place setting and hostess set in my lined dinnerware case. Don't hesitate, just purchase."
"These are well designed and crafted, reasonably solid without being clumsy in the hand. The metal seems up to the task, and we expect to get many years of use from this set. We are very satisfied."
"We were surprised to see that the under side of these were not rounded like the topside. We are otherwise thrilled with the quality, but may return because the edge of the bottom side is uncomfortable."
I have not always loved flatware I‚Äôve gotten on Amazon. This set is a winner - bought this as a Christmas gift and the recipient ordered a bunch more because she loved them too.
"No issues after three months, awesome set and lots of pieces."
If you want a beautiful sturdy set of flat wear this is it:) Heavy pieces & dishwasher safe . Smooth & comfortable to hold.
The fork tines are sharper than other silverware that I have owned. The knives are sharp but not dangerously sharp. love the quality and the sturdiness. This is great value for your money.
Very happy with product
I want my money back! This is a lot of money to spend on something I could have got for $10
"Hard to find silverware online, but this set has a really nice weight to it, and they are well balanced. The only downside is the finickyness of the mirror finish, but I still thing their worth it."
I bought these to replace another set I bought and this one is fabulous!
"I am impressed! The silverware has a simple elegant design that is easy to hold and cut meat with. I examined every piece and they were all flawless (i.e. no imperfections). And, the silverware is not heavy, although it‚Äôs classified as heavy duty on Amazon. Loved the great price!"
"I really like nice sturdy flatware. My sister-in-law had these and I loved them so much that I ordered one set and then, a couple weeks later, a second set for myself. They are simple but elegant, a really nice weight, and dishwasher safe. And the price can't be beat. I highly recommend these!"
"Very heavy, shiny and simple. They will slip off the plate due to the weight but I am very happy."
Very happy with the quality and heft
They are heavy and very sturdy. Arrived well package and in great condition. It was a worthy purchase. Love it!
"I like the weight and the style of this cutlery, it's a good value for what you get."
Actually very happy with this purchase! Very sturdy utensils. Easy to clean.
"Love, love everything about this silverware set. I was a little wearying of the quality and durability because of the price, but don‚Äôt be fooled. You won‚Äôt regret it, just get it!"
This stainless steel was an excellent value. The icees are sturdy and dishwasher safe. They come out of the dishwasher very shiny and spot free
"Very nice utensils! Good size, nice heavy feel, and they are very easy to clean. Easy to hold in your hand. Very sturdy. Don‚Äôt think you will ever bend them."
I love them! Very high quality and a pleasure to use
Accurate written description. Nicely heavy in the hand.
Nice sturdy feel
Great silverware I love the Finish
"it is very sturdy, had clean lines. I like it"
Good weight and beautiful finish. Would definitely recommend!
Serves my everyday needs and seem to be as advertised.
Very sturdy and beautiful. Cleans up perfectly
few of the edges where sharp but I took a nail file and smoothed them out.
The product is not as heavy duty as advertised.
"Very well packaged. I hope it will keep its shine after several uses. In the coming months, I will know more about this"
Very sturdy
love this set!
Nice heavy flatware
Much heavier than my old silverware and much sturdier
Perfect size and weight. We like heavier stainless. We get compliments on them. Just beautiful!
Thinking about buying another set. Well worth the money for every day use.
Very good
Sturdy. Classy and simple look. Great price for quality product.
sturdy and easy to hold
"Excellent feel and weight! Made with 18/0 stainless steel, so dishwasher safe."
"It's beautiful, sturdy and has a nice weight to it."
Love this!! very sturdy!!
Just right amount of weight and wash up really nice in dishwasher
Heavy duty and May order additional ones for kids
Very good quality...nicely priced as well.
These are not lightweight they are a very nice weight. I wasn‚Äôt sure when I ordered them but pleasantly surprised. My son is moving and so I may have to buy him a set. I think they are a better quality for the price then you get at any retail store
Loved the shine!
It came with only 11 knives.
"So I had purchased a well-reviewed set of name-brand black silverware prior to buying these. The 1st set, the black just came off with simple washing. Note, I do not have a dishwasher...so just hand-washing was ruining them. With that frustration, I settled on these. I have had ZERO issue with these, as I tend to wait to review a product until I have had a good chance to use them for awhile. SO, if you are unsure about all the black silverware out there - I would strongly suggest looking into these. They are durable and stunning."
"Perfect flatware for daily use. Sturdy, large and not lightweight like other stuff I have. I just hope the spoons don‚Äôt all disappear like my last set!!!"
"Very nice quality of silverware. Does not water spot. Great, simple design. Good price."
I am in LOVE with this set. I bought two to have enough sets for my amount of plates. And love them so far. It's been a couple of months and they clean up just as nice as they did when I bought them. Still the color and shine I look for. And still just as sturdy.  The value is really where I am happy. These were the best valued set I found and at first was worried.... Thinking they would fall apart or the finish would disintegrate.  So far I was wrong. Good set.
The flatware is heavier than I thought it would be. They come out of the dishwasher shiny with no spots. I was concerned about that and relieved. They are a good set for the price
"This flatware is well-made, sturdy, and looks nice on the table. Has had multiple trips through the dishwasher and so far all is well. Very happy with this purchase."
""
"Basically all we wanted was a matching set of flatware because we had a bunch of mismatched knives, forks and spoons from years of marriage. For the money I spent I wasn't expecting anything more than that __just a matching group of flatware! Therefore you can imagine our surprise when we got this product. The sets are beautifully made and look very nice! When washed in the dishwasher none of them spotted or stained! They cleaned up nicely. I feel like I am stealing a little bit because the price was so low! Highly recommend this flatware!"
"II have tried several flatware sets over the years; they have always been flimsy and bend just by looking at them. Until now! Packaging was perfect! No scratches at all! Each utensil was protected, but not to the point where it will take you more than a few seconds to remove the protection. Very nice weight! I will admit that I've never seen a spoon (not the teaspoon) this large. But for me, it's perfect! I highly recommend!"
"I am absolutely amazed by the quality of this flatware! So much quality for under $40.00. First of all, it is beautiful, shines like real silver. Secondly, it is the quality you would expect from a highline not this price point. It is heavy, not cheap stamped on the back flatware.  I bought the 45 piece 2 days ago and turned around and bought the 40 piece today and threw all my old flatware in the trash.  I expect this to be the last everyday flatware I will ever buy."
"I had been looking for heavy-duty silverware with longer forks for a long time - these fit the bill perfectly. They have a good heft to them without being too weighty. I love the size of the tablespoons - almost serving size really and the teaspoons are as big as my old tablespoons. I know some folks said they were too big, but they are exactly what I was looking for. I wish you could buy the forks separately - would love to have another set for that reason but don't need the rest of them. Anyway, I'm happy, happy, happy and if you have hesitated about buying these - don't! Buy them. One more thing, I've put them in the dishwasher many times and they come out perfect."
"Neutral styling maybe modern if anything, clean lines, nice weight, a bit big not for tiny hands but not overly large. Knifes are offset so can cut through without striking your knuckles. Finish is nice shiny looks very nice. Great for everyday use and after a few dishwashes still looks nice. Great value"
"I was very impressed with the thickness and weight of this set. They are a much heavier gauge that the set they are replacing. They may be a little larger than my old set but are by no means bulky. I have used them for a few months and I have not found any that are sharp, rough or have any problems with the finish. I have a black porcelin sink, dinerware set and appliances which they match well. A very attractive set. They do need to be dried or my very hard water will spot them up pretty good however, the same is true with my black sink, dinerware and appliances which I am drying anyway so I would expect nothing less. The fact they look so good after washing and drying them makes drying them seam less of a hassel. I'm very happy with the set and would order again."
Purchased this set to replace our missed matched flatware. The set was complete and I inspected each piece. The pieces are medium weight and sturdy it is a good-looking set. I will pdate in a few months to rate the quality.
"This flatware is beautiful and simple. It can go from everyday dinner table to your elegant Christmas party. The weight of each piece is perfect, not to heavy and not to light. Fits comfortably in your hands. My favorite, the salad fork, is not too big and too small it's just right. This set cleans up well too. We hand wash our dishes so I cannot speak to dishwasher effects. My husband actually said he liked the flatware too...his review...""its not busy, it feels right in the hand."" You won't be disappointed."
"I wanted to wait for some time before I reviewed this tableware. Some of the reviews said that these russt easily, but we have not had any such problem. These are very nice quality items. My husband likes a little heavier tableware (must a guy thing), and he really likes these. They wash up easily and have maintained their original luster after hundreds of washes, both by hand and in the dishwasher."
"I was looking for everyday silverware. I didn't want anything too ""fussy."" When I found this, I liked the design and I liked the price. As an added bonus: the knives actually cut! Usually, all table knives are good for is spreading. These knives aren't going to cut your finger, but they do cut a sandwich without smashing it. This was a wonderful added bonus!"
"I was a little apprehensive buying new flatware sight unseen, but I was really quite pleased with this set. It is way heavier than I thought which was a concern that I would get some flimsy lightweight stuff, not these, they look like they will stand the test of time and will not bend. And just really pretty."
Was very happy with this order. The flatware was heavier then I expected. It came fast and was pack very well. I am proud and happy to give this as a gift. Thank you and will recommend. you to friends.
"Smooth, clean, and weighty. I was surprised by the quality of this cutlery. I've used them for about one month now and I continue to be pleased with the quality. Do not hesitate to buy! A++"
"These are great...You get 8pcs of knives, serving spoon, regular spoons, dinner forks and salad forks. They are sturdy and just the right weight."
"I purchased this set. The pattern was the closest to my current silverware set. It doesn't weigh in my hand as my current silverware does, but it is sturdy, and looks durable, and I think will be a great value for the money. I have been looking for additional pieces to my current silverware and I look forward to using using this set for family dinners!"
"Just started using them, had costly French silverware , course it is all made in China. :((( but like this set, just better NOT rust, as one reviewer stated above. Will be continued......"
I am so very happy with this purchase. I read some of the other reviews and almost didn't order. Silverware has been put in the dishwasher several times since I purchased and it's still beautiful. Sturdy and has some weight to it. Very pleased!
I've been using this flatware for about 2 weeks. There are a good weight without being too heavy (the reason I got rid of my last set). Great size. So far holding up well to dishwashing. Very pleased so far.
I was looking for something different to match my new dishes. This silverware set is it! Sleek looking and functional. Durable and wash well in the dishwasher. Color shines through with no problem of discoloration. Bought additional sets. Also have received lots of compliments.
Love these stainless steel set the best ever strong don't bend cleans great stays shiny wash after wash and the price wow! This set will last me until I will Expire! Timothy Ellis
Amazing for the price! They feel like high end silverware but for a fraction of the cost. These are a nice addition to our camper!‚ù§Ô∏è
"Durable, shiny, classy. Looks more expensive then they are. Includes great care instructions to keep them in new level appearance. Very happy with product."
"These are probably some of the sturdiest and durable sets of silverware. I was extremely surprised. They are very nice, absolutely love them!"
"I love how shiny and comfortable everything is. I can't believe I got this nice of a set for what I paid. There's only one thing that I was disappointed in and that was the size of the salad forks, but I don't really use those so no big deal. Delivery was fast and it was a no hassle deal. I would recommend this set and this seller."
I bought these for my travel trailer. Love them. Strong and nice looking.
I had to buy anew set as the movers lost our silverware. They are nice looking great price
"I like the size of the utensils, the feel, the weight, I am glad that we purchased these. Worth the money."
This flatware is perfect for my family. The flatware is abused and still holds up like new.
Weight of the utensils Is very important to me. I don‚Äôt want the handle to be too thin you think you might break it and I‚Äôm not really fond of too much art on the end of Your utensil. I purchased this blind faith from the Internet and got just what I wanted
The bottom of the flatware is wide enough that I can put in my dishwasher and it doesn‚Äôt get stuck in the bottom of the rack. Beautiful. Very pleased.
I was surprised at the quality. Sturdy and a good weight which is important in silverware.
"I was so surprised at how lightning fast my order arrived - like, one day! Very nice silverware. Good price too."
Very pleased with this set. They do not appear cheap but instead are sturdy and appear as if they'll last for years.
"I use the flatware for everyday use. The utensils are attractive, highly polished, and sturdy. A good value."
Liked the design. Subdued but attractive.
"They are very well made, and doesn't feel cheap."
Stainless flatware set is very nice. Flatware is sturdy and dishwasher safe. Very satisfied with our purchase.
I was pleasantly surprised to see the high quality of this silverware and I like it very much. Came well packaged too.
"These came on time and were perfect. Not too heavy, well balanced, good sized teaspoons that appear too large but are great, knife is serrated so it cuts well. Would but again for sure."
Good silverware at a good price. Comfortable to use.
Beautiful set of silverware. Very sturdy. Great quality.
Great quality for the money. Purchased two sets as we always run out between wash cycles. Nice to be able to get a nice set of utensils without the extra pieces you never use.
"I haven‚Äôt used these much as yet, but I like that they are Plain because food won‚Äôt get lodged in between some design, etc"
"I haven't bought a new set of silverware in YEARS. I researched this brand and if course, found it on Amazon. Very, very happy! Easy to clean, sturdy and pretty."
"Looks good and works well, has a good feel to it, i would have preferred shorter handles, forks feel like long handled shovels."
This is a good set for the price. The pieces are large enough and heavy enough. The finishing is good.
Great quality!
"This silverware set is very sturdy. ""Feels"" like the more expensive brands. Is nice because it is a very neutral pattern so goes with everything and comes with a lot of pieces. Very pleased!"
Great silverware. Sleek looking. Would recommend.
"The quality of the whole surpassed my expectations, the price was very reasonable too, I have recommended this to my friends."
"As ""The Kids"" moved away (finally) and got my regular silverware together, I saw that I was missing a lot of them. This silverware is at a great price and very well made. Good weight, all well rounded edges and color as advertised. Just go for them, don't search any longer."
Was thinking it was going to be 'light' but it has a good feel and is sturdy to use. Very happy with our choice.
The flatware arrived as described. Hopefully they will continue to look as nice as they do now.
"We just received this so cannot rate on durability yet, but it matches our current silverware perfectly."
Flatware worked out great love the long & short forks. So far still shining! Would buy again.
Beautiful and classic set.
I‚Äôve been using for a couple of weeks and this flatware is holding up beautifully. It still looks new after several washing in the dishwasher.
The silverware is a beatiful collection for being a plan design
Perfect basic set of silverware. Large and small forks and spoons
Awesome set for the money. Heavy duty and sharp looking too. Love this set. Great value
A gift for my daughter and she is so pleased with them
"Very impressed, sturdy & shiny. As far as durability don‚Äôt know, they were just put out a few days ago."
I loved this set of flatware utensils. Very good quality and strong.
Highly recommend looks good and nice quality. I was getting low on forks and spoons somehow the had disappeared with two teens. I found this to be a good deal. No complaints.
Much better than I'd thought they'd be for the price! They don't feel cheap!
The bigger spoon is almost like a serving spoon

Love the weight and sturdiness
"Update edit: Contacted the seller, they explained that the knives don't have the same finish in order to keep the edge and need to be hand-washed. They sent out replacements in a timely manner, and my set is no longer rusted. Very happy with my purchase.  I really like this silverware, but with the first wash, all of the knives rusted. It's very odd because none of the other pieces rusted, just the knives. And not just one or two, every single knife. I specifically bought these because they were advertised as 18/10 steel and would not rust. The finish on them seems to have come off or been scratched."
"I am always apprehensive about buying things I want to last from Amazon, it's hit or miss from some of these brands. These turned out to be a worthy purchase! The quality is excellent, definitely 18/10 because of the weight. So far no rusting, discoloration or stains from dishwashing. We love the hammered pattern which is unnoticeable to the touch when in the hand. No sharp edges or unevenness. They have slightly scratched from daily use, but they are faintly visible, just a natural part of owning silverware (or anything). My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that I don't like the brand logo printed on the back of the silverware, but that's just my personal preference."
"Short and simple ‚Äì this set has vastly surpassed my expectations.  My first impression after opening the box was how gorgeous the hammered handles are. I absolutely love their finish and design. Being that it was just about dinner time, this was a perfect opportunity to put them to the test.  The utensils are sized just right, and their weight was just perfect. This set feels heavy, but not overly heavy and definitely didn't feel flimsy. Also, the utensils are significantly more comfortable than my Mikasa set.  The knife was well balanced and surprisingly sharp. While this isn‚Äôt a steak knife (I would not be surprised if it cut through steak!), it was much better than I would have expected from a stainless dinner knife.  This is a phenomenal set at a great value. I love the finish and design of the set. The quality is on par or better than some fancy boutique sets that cost more than double, especially since some of those are nowhere near as comfortable as this set. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to regret not ordering the 40 piece set."
"This is a lovely set of stainless flatware. Every part of the individual pieces are smooth, the hammered finish is gorgeous (and bright/shiny if that is what you are looking for). The set is oversized, the spoons have larger than typical bowls so factor that in. Each piece is heavy. Much more weight than I expected. If you are looking for a heft, a shiny textured modern finish, and larger-scale set of quality, you might want to give this set serious consideration if it fits your criteria. Also, it came in a quality well-made box with each piece in a plastic protective sleeve, so if you are giving this as a gift you can be proud of its presentation. It does NOT include serving pieces but I didn't want them, so that was a plus for me."
"I never thought I would be raving about a set of silverware at 20 years old but I LOVE these! So clean, such a nice design, caked on food comes right off. 10/10 recommend this set. They also match perfectly to the silver hammered knife set that Cuisinart sells!!"
"I like this flatware very much. It is heavy, well balanced and even the knives don't show any sign of rust on their sharp blades after many passes through the dishwasher. The very shiny hammered pattern goes around the entire handle of the spoons, forks and knives. I highly recommend."
Loved the look and feel. Very heavy and well crafted. Will be buying the serving pieces next. Wide blade on knife makes cutting and spreading butter or jam easy
I like the weight. I hate cheap flimsy silverware and this set is beautiful. Definitely would make a very nice gift. I don‚Äôt put the knives in the dishwasher like the manufacturer suggests. It‚Äôs held up great and the hammered look is really pretty.
"These are great. There beautiful, sturdy a nice weight but not heavy, the spoons are a great size for cearial"
"High quality and well packed. The size of the spoon and small forks are much larger than what I used to. Probably American have larger then Europe... For me, the spoons are almost as a size as a regular cup, see attached image. At the right, other brands small cup and small fork."
"Love this set. Sturdy, stylish, great quality"
Love this flatware!!! The hammered look is beautiful
We love this set they are beautiful and sturdy. Already ordered the serving set.
Great quality. Pretty.
"So far so good, comes out nice from the dishwasher."
Beautiful and sturdy.
Nice and heavy. They are beautiful!
Beautiful hammered stainless dinner ware. Looks better than most everyday ware. Real class!
They were nice.... heavy ! Look pretty.. however! They rusted ! The very first time I washed! I wouldn‚Äôt buy . You can find better for the same price if not cheaper  Update! Since I‚Äôve left this review I‚Äôve revived a email from the company and they informed me that the knives were not 18/10 because they need their sharp ridges . They apologized And offered to send out new ones .
My mother had these and liked them so ordered
"Hudson Essentials claims their stainless steel silverware is 18/10, but it seemed much lighter in weight than the Crate & Barrel Mesa version or the Oneida Cabria version. The Hudson dinner forks are quite big and the salad fork is too large as well. The serving pieces are huge and the cake server and cake knife are gigantic! It's as though the pieces were made for basketball players with very large hands. Also, the hammering is not consistent. It should be more defined. If the lighter weight, the large size of the pieces and inconsistent hammering are not a problem, it could be a worthwhile purchase as it is much less money. I ended up getting the Oneida Cabria which looks and feels better, but has issues as well."
"I absolutely LOVE this set! I hesitated buying for a couple weeks after reading a few reviews that said the set rusts. However, I loved the look and thought I would buy and see for myself. I purchased nearly 3 months ago and I haven't had any rust at all. I never soak them but I do put them in the dishwasher with no issues. They come out looking flawless and beautiful every time!! They are substantial and have decent weight to them...they do not look or feel cheap!! I highly recommend anyone thinking about getting the set to just buy, you won't be disappointed! I first ordered a set of 8 and loved them so much, I bought another set of 4!"
Love this priduct high quslity
"This company has excellent customer service and integrity, and for that reason alone I would buy from them again. I had an issue with the first order and they contacted me on their own to correct the situation, and sent me a replacement immediately. The replacement set was perfect. I can only imagine that the issue I encountered with the first order was uncommon. This set is gorgeous and well manufactured with a substantial weight to them. The finish is sleek and shiny, and they wash up beautifully."
"Really good flatware, solid weight and edges are soft - cheap flatware has sharp edges on the handles but these are nicely rounded just enough. I threw everything in the dishwasher except the knives and no sign of rust in first wash. I am heeding the seller's advice to hand wash the knives because the serrated blades are not 18/10."
Already rusting in some spots .... save your money complete junk
"So far I am very happy with this silverware. I have been using bits and pieces of several sets and to open my silverware drawer and see this beautiful silverware is so nice. I read that some folks said that the knives rusted, well I have seen no sign of rust as yet. Every piece is shiny and worth the money."
"After watching my flatware disappear mysteriously over the years, it was time for a new set. Upon the reviews of this Hudson set, I took a chance and ordered one. This set exceeded my expectations. I love eating from these durable, beautiful utensils everyday. They are gorgeous."
"I bought this flatware in October. The butter knives are all scratched upon the tips, apparently from going through the dishwasher. I have never owned a set of tableware that did this. I would send them back if I could. Buyer beware."
This is such heavy and nice flatware I always read the bad reviews first and if I can live with them I will buy The is worth the price
"These are great I love them. They are very sturdy, and thick. Way better then the cheep Wally world ones. BUT if your wife is anything like mine and she likes the ""little forks"" vs the big forks. This set has little forks that are actually the same size as the ""big forks"" she doesn't like. And this sets big forks or ""dinner forks "" are massive. But, I like them just fine."
I‚Äôve had the flat wear for about six weeks now and the pieces remain a shiny today as they did on day one. It‚Äôs well-balanced for your hand and the weight is perfect. I didn‚Äôt think I would like the hammered look as much as I do. I‚Äôd recommend this product. My only negative is that there were no serving pieces included.
The weight and feel are exactly what I was looking for. The nice restaurant feel but at home. The texture is enough to grip but not so much that it is distracting. The weight is enough that you know you do not fear bending the fork or spoon if you apply pressure. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
"Love this set! Would buy again, now looking forward to purchasing the service set as well! Beautiful for the price, truly a mirror finish. Lovely on my table!"
Some of the pieces are rusting on the handles after dishwasher use. This seems really odd for this level of stainless steel. This is after probably half a dozen washes at most.
"Good looking, and seem to be a good value for the money, however I have only been using them for a couple months. I will be monitoring. Also, the pieces have nice weight to them and are as pictured, if not more pleasing in person."
"Wow, that is the first word out of everyone's mouth when they see them. They are very thick, sturdy and stylish! It is a huge bonus that these are dishwasher safe and do not discolor."
I‚Äôm extremely satisfied with this flatware. It is beautiful and well-made. I would recommend to anyone who may be on the fence about whether or not to purchase these utensils.
"Have ""used"" for 2 weeks now. Quality throughout the set is excellent. They have been through the dishwasher 4-5 times now and look as good as new if not better. Very happy with my purchase. I have no problem recommending this product as I feel I got my moneys worth."
These are much nicer than any set I have sever owned!! Heavy set and does not bend like other sets do. Also very nice looking. Hammered design on both sides of every piece.
"Great set! Nice and sturdy, heavy enough they don‚Äôt feel cheap. Had held up well with daily use and dishwasher."
Love my silverware. So much wish I had known about this I would have been ordered them years ago. I have been telling everyone that I know about them. Hopefully they will order them some. So Thank you very much. Oh buy the way the people that have seen them think that I have paid hundreds of dollars for them. Until I told the real price they said I have to get me some ....!!!üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüëèüëè
Fantastic product. Nice and sturdy. No give at all. Spoons pass the hard ice cream test! I found a box of service for 4 at Khols for more than double what I paid for this service for 8 at Amazon. Excellent product and an even better value!
I love this silverware! This silverware set looks even better in person than the pictures. They feel really good in the hand. The weight and thickness of each piece is perfect. This silverware is a great value for money and I would definitely recommend it.
"We really like this set so far. Very heavy duty and rigid. It has been thru several wash cycles in the dishwasher with zero issues thus far. My review is based on one month of ownership, but we are very satisfied."
This flatware has an excellent feel and quality. So far it has held up well and does not get water spots when washed in the dishwasher. We are delighted.
"You never know the weight when you order on line but this set of silverware was stylish, heavy and beautiful."
"Really nice set of utensils. I love the heavy feeling and hammered look. Some ppl have posted that the knives are not dishwasher safe and rust. I dont own one so I can't say, so far hand washing has been fine and easy to clean."
"Great set of silverware. Shiny, heavy-duty, smooth edges, firm fork tongs. So much better than the stuff I was coming across in stores. Love the hammered finish."
they are much more elegant in person. love the way they feel when you hold them. the hammered finish is gorgeous in the light and it is very smooth touch holding the fork and knife. makes everything taste much better ; ) so far it has been the best bargain for stocking our beach rental
"We have used our new set for a week and we love the quality! This set is stylish enough for guests but still durable enough for every day use. The teaspoons are a nice size bowl, perfect in my opinion. As a different reviewer stated, the size and weight feel good in your hand. I am very happy with this brand."
"I received a set of these, and it looks like I received two completely different finishes. One is shiny and one has a brushed finish. The spoons arrived with dings in them and damaged on the outer rim where you'd eat from. Disappointed and returning these."
Comes out of my dishwasher bright and shined like new
This set is gorgeous! It‚Äôs better than what I expected. Good value for the money. I‚Äôm about to purchase the matching serving spoons ü•Ñ because I plan on using this set for a long time. Very very satisfied with this purchase.
This cutlery looks refined and is strong enough to be used everyday. Does not get spots after drying.
So pretty and a perfect weight. I even ordered a second set.
"Quality built, nice design. A true pleasure to look at"
"Heavy weight, nice balance, and nice looking. Perfect for use in our motor home kitchen."
I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews stating problems with rusting of the knives. I have seen no evidence of this after several dishwasher cycles.
I was very pleased to see the weight and high polish of this set. Attractive design as well. Overall a good purchase.
Denali is a better product. Bigger utensils.
This is great flatware. Great feel. Beautiful look.
Very nice finish and quality. Nice and heavy
"I like flatware with a bit of heft. But not heavy. This is both. The flatware is of good quality, functionality and design. No rust issues. Flatware cleans well in dishwasher. I think I would have spent more money on a quality set like this, so I see the flatware as a good value. We haven't experienced any problems or dislikes."
Set looks great and good value but the knife blade has some give to it and you can bend it with little effort.
I love these. They‚Äôre cool looking and sturdy without being too heavy.
So far the flatware is awesome! It is really pretty and very sturdy!
We are very picky about our flatwear. Cheap lightweight flatwear can ruin a meal. This is beautiful and affordable and excellent quality!
"Great product. I wish they offered a serving set that was an exact match. I bought the servers that comes in a satin finish but there was not an offering to match the mirror finish of the flatware. Love the flatware, though!!!"
"Design wise, a couple of corners on handles could be softened"
Lovely place setting I like how our dining table looks with these place settings
Love them!!
"Aunt Deborah Stole my Black Silverware Set  Decided to pick up this unique flatware set for eight to use at a recent dinner party. No one in my family has ever seen stainless steel silverware with a mirror polished black finish before that day. My uncle was the only relative who didn‚Äôt care for them. He said the mirror polished made them look fake. Have no idea what he‚Äôs talking about? Think my uncle Ray drank too much Corn whiskey that morning.  Each piece in this set has a nice solid weight to it. Beautiful flower laser pattern on the handle adds an air of subtle elegance especially in a formal table setting. The steak knives deliver that final shock factor to anyone seeing them for the first time.  Wish they came packaged in a wooden case, instead of a paperboard box. Product presentation is important to me.  My aunt Deborah really like this flatware set a lot. Didn‚Äôt realize how much until the next day when I noticed the paperboard box I put them back in after cleaning was missing. Told me she‚Äôll bring them back in a few weeks. I don‚Äôt believe that for this isn‚Äôt the first time she covertly ‚ÄúBorrowed‚Äù something from my house. Been two years since she appropriated our stainless-steel stockpot in the same fashion.  Just keep your eye on sticky finger relatives if you happen to pull this EUIRIO 48-piece black silverware set with steak knives out for a family get together. Don‚Äôt even lend it out for you will never see it again. I promise you that."
"This silverware set is not poor quality but it is not top quality either. Back is just stamped ""Stainless Steel"". There's no logo or brand name. Each piece is fairly heavy and certainly not prone to bend. Knives have the pattern on both sides. Other pieces, only one side. Steak knife handle seems to be made out of some sort of plastic resin. Rivets in the knife handle are well done and heads are flush with the handle. The blade is completely serrated except for the last 3/8"" at the point of the blade.  It seems like this set first had the black finish baked on. The intricate pattern is etched in and therefore reveals the stainless steel finish below. It is a cool look. It will be interesting to see if the black finish scratches or wears off over time. It looks great right now."
"This really weighty tableware. It is not delicate but it is somewhat inspiring. It is not exactly French, nor is it American British Crown influence Victorian. It could have a little of the Muscovite in the design. It even brings forth a hint of the rustic flavor. e sense that it can go with almost any table cloth.  Easy To Clean:  I have used and washed every piece in the set at least three times and it is holding its own so far. I have not really been careful as I wash. Just load the sink with it add my detergent hot water and scrub each piece with a paper towel wad. Noting rubs off and the design is perfectly flat which adds to the ease of washing.  The color has a only the slightest hint of a blue cast so I thought how wonderful to team it up with a set of Mikassa dinnerware that I reviewed.e of months past. (see IMAGE) My only regret is that it did not have a set of butter knives to complete the set perfectly. You can do a simple formal table and do a formal setting with the addition of a butter knife set and ther addition of a bread plate or larger saucer. Ah well, it is not a fault since the seller did not mention a butter knife or include it in the description, It would be nice to know whether a butter knife is available.  STURDINESS:  Again' let me reiterate, it is heavy tableware. It is not dainty and it is not likely ever to bend while in use. The word here is sturdy. I rather prefer the more rugged table utensil and would probably prefer the serrated dinner knives to cut my meat rather than the steak knives that are part of the set. By the way, those steak knives are well made with full tang and three rivets in thke handles of each..  I like this Euirio 48 piece black flatware set with steak knives...a setting for eight. It is a keeper. Order the set and have fun creating striking table settings."
"I love this silverware set! The unique style catches everyone's eye and it adds a layer of beauty to the table. Everyone has silverware, and I've always kept my eyes open to find a way to add some flare, to something that seems to always look the same as what was in my great grandmother's house. This set surpasses anything I could have imagined! Not only are they beauty pieces, they are fully functional. I had some bronze silverware that I was using and I was always told the pieces looked nice, but the salad forks and tea spoons were more like baby utensils and the soup spoons were very flat, not functional. That is not the case here! Every piece is beautiful and functional, even the steak knives are really sharp! The only concern that time will tell is how the pieces hold up through washing. I've been handwashing them and they look great, but I'm sure that my kids will end up getting them in the dishwasher. Also, I'm not sure about sharpening the knives. Still, wouldn't give these up for anything, I love the unique style and the functionality makes these a steal!"
We got this to use in our new home. We decided to start over with a whole new set and this one looked like a great way to do that.  It arrives ready to wash and use. The set also comes in a gift worthy box.  It seems to be well made. The pieces all feel balanced in our hands. The flowers are etched in so they should last as long as the utensils do. The etching is still smooth. There is no hitch or ledge.  They have a nice mouth feel. They were comparable to our stainless steel set to wash.  It is very beautiful in person. We would buy these again.
"This is the most beautiful silverware set I have ever owned. Although I am using them for everyday use, they are pretty and elegant enough to use for a fancy dinner or with your china. They are easily cleaned and seem to be holding up well to use. I love the sizes they give and the quality of each different one. I also love that the set comes with steak knives because usually sets like this do not. I love that it's pretty but also sturdy and they don't feel super light and cheap like some silverware does. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this set."
"This silverware set is gorgeous and they are great quality. These would be amazing to use when you have dinner guests over. They will definitely be impressed with this silverware.  This set includes: -8 Large spoons -8 small spoons -8 Large forks -8 small forks -8 knifes -8 Butter knifes  That‚Äôs 48 pieces of silverware all together.  Overall, I got all of my pieces of silverware and this set looks as advertised. I have no complaints."
"We were surprised how much we liked this black flatware set! It's really different, yet has an elegant look to it.  The surfaces have a nice, smooth feel to them.  Ours arrived nicely packaged and free from scratches or defects.  At Amazon's current price of around $50, you're really only paying about a dollar per piece. Seems like a great value to me.  Highly recommended!!!"
"This flatware set is gorgeous! I love that the pattern is even on the steak knives, that is honestly delightful. They did not lose their luster or any color/pattern when running them thru the dishwasher either!"
This silverware set arrives well packaged with each piece in its own plastic sleeve and is easy to unpack and start enjoying right away. These pieces are so much prettier in person than the picture. They are beautiful pieces of art. They are comfortable to hold. They are a nice weight and not too thin. We love them so very much and highly recommend them.
"These look really unique. I do put mine in the dishwasher, but I‚Äôm careful to only use a soft sponge on them too. They do eventually get some scratches. Nonetheless, they look great and we use them everyday.  Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
"Got these to replace an old set i got from Walmart that had been losing pieces. The designs on these are absolutely beautiful. The pictures online didn't really do them justice. I'm hoping they hold up to wear and washing, but so far so good. They're also thick, sturdy metal, not thin and cheap."
Cutlery so stunning you almost don‚Äôt want to eat with it. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. Well made and a high quality set. This would make a great gift but the packaging is not the best so maybe repackage it with a pretty box and it will be the most awesome gift ever.
"I love this set. The design is beautiful. Well made, sturdy. Look and feel great"
Pretty little pattern. Nice balance. Attractive silverware. Matte set.
I only have good things to say about this silverware set. The design is very luxurious and beautiful it is such a nice quality design that is unique and sophisticated in the design. The black background with white roses is amazing and adds so much character to my kitchen. The pieces are all full sized and each item is well made without scuffs or damage. The material is Stanless steel and beautifully made. This set is designed for special occasions and should be handled carefully for best use. It is recommended to handmade and not use steel wool or hard detergents. These should be dried right away after cleaning. This set is amazing and I love that it has matching steak knives. Buy these if you need a beautiful luxury set for dinner parties or entering. This set is nice enough to be in your China cabinet.
"We've been mixing and matching a couple sets for years now, so seeing this setting for 8 was great. Not only does it include a full set for dining for 8, but there is a beautiful pattern. These have a nice weight to them and seem very well made. Been through the dishwasher a few times now with no noticeable wear and tear other than where two knives hit each other on the serration. I do have a concern about longevity with the finish, as one of our knives new already came with a blemish, but so far no new blemishes. The steak knives seem to have a poorer finish than the rest of the set, so with good care hopefully will hold up as well as the rest of the set. I love the way these look and feel and bought a second set to save for the big get-togethers with family/friends."
"This set of flatware (blackware???) is stunning. I have a black and white decor in my kitchen and dining room. For holidays or seasons I add of touch of color too. But for this occassion I stayed with black and white only. Guests were dumbfounded by this set. I think they spent more time admiring the pieces than actually using them.  Each is properly weighted so they do not feel inexpensive. The design does not chip or rub off. Each is very comfortable to hold regardless of gender or hand size. The steak knife cuts through a thick cut of beef with ease.  My only complaint is how they are packaged. These beautiful utensils deserve to be in a nice wooden box, not jammed into a thin piece of cardboard. If in a nice box they would make a fabulous wedding gift."
"- Made in China  I've been seeing this set for at least a year and a half, flooding in from the foreign Alibaba-esque resellers. I thought it was busy but pretty but just never took the plunge. Saw them again now and finally decided to try them.  These are the same as all the rest in a couple of areas but happily better in a couple of others.  First, the 'active' edges, while not as smooth as most real brand flatware, is still much better than usual.  The table knife also is perfect. Not too much serration, having it only on the one side, and the butt end isn't too sharp.  Unfortunately the butt end of everything else is rough. Not enough to cut but can be irritating.  The steak knives are also terrible. Huge, wide serration, much too strong. Rips and shreds instead of cuts.  Fork tines are just slightly pokey  Tablespoon is huge, closer to a serving spoon, but I don't care about that. The bowl size of both is good.  I do love the design even though it's quite busy. Especially the part that extends into the 'working' end. A solid 4 stars for me.  Be sure to price check, there's still dozens of these sets out there.

I bought this set to add on to a set I'd purchased almost 10 years ago. Over the years a few pieces were lost. Imagine my delight when I found the exact pattern here! Now I have more than enough spoons for when my little grandkids come to visit...a new spoon for every snack!
Love the quality and beauty of the Oneida flatware. It's sturdy and I love the design. I ordered two sets and I'm glad I did. They will last a lifetime.
"I've never had a product from Oneida that ever disappointed and this set of flatware is no exception. Sturdy, stylish, washes well and maintains its shine. Oneida is an affordable and beautiful set and the perfect alternative to ""silverware""."
"I ordered 2 sets. Love them,nice & shiny. Good weight to them but not to heavy. Hold up well in the dishwasher. . Very happy with my purchase."
This are not light weight. Will not bend as you use. Very nice.
There is not one thing that I dislike about them. Beautiful with a nice weight to the utensils. Perfect for everyday use.
Really like the look and feel of the flatware. Have purchased it for vacation rental.
Sturdy Oneida brand reliable!
Perfectshipped timely
easy to hold
Attractive and sturdy.
Just what we need.
I love my new silverware but was disappointed that the knife handles have started to rust. Four out of the eight are already damaged.
I hate buying silverware but it was time.. I swear to you this set is amazing. The utensils are a great weight and easy to clean!
liked it
Liked everything
Very sturdy yet elegant.
"I ordered two of these sets and followed the instructions included in the box to wash them in the dishwasher before their first use. ALL of the knives in both sets rusted after only one wash in the dishwasher. This has never happened with any of my other stainless cutlery. I washed on a regular cycle with Cascade detergent and Finish Jet Dry. To me, this indicates a defective, improperly sealed product. Both sets are being returned."
"We went for the more expensive option assuming the quality was worth the higher cost. WRONG. Other Oneida cookware has performed very well. But this flatware set, though looking great has rusted on the knife blades. It has not held up as well as the inexpensive IKEA options. Very disappointed."
I wanted a complete flatware set to last many years. Several pieces were damaged and scratched up. One spoon had a large obvious mark on the front shaded handle that was very ugly and obvious. I expected more from Oneida and that their quality control would not put damaged pieces into a nice set. I also wondered if maybe the seller was a ‚Äúscratch and dent‚Äù type of seller where they purposely were selling the set at a discounted rate because they knew about it.
This set was a nice set by looks and feel but the first time I washed them in the dishwasher all the handle tips of the dinner knives rusted. I was so disappointed as this set looked very nice. The rest of the pieces washed up just fine with no rust. They did offer replacing them but I opted for a full refund because I didn't want to chance it happening again.
The tip of the spoons have a sharp edge that is nicked and rough. I wouldn't want to put these in my mouth.
"Knife handles rusted within a week. Do not buy. I purchased new Oneida flatware based on the quality of my old Oneida flatware, which still looks good after 15 years. Evidence suggests the Oneida name is now associated with extremely poor quality. Either they don‚Äôt have effective quality control or they are intentionally selling garbage."
This stainless set is my favorite. The weight is balanced and it holds up in the dishwasher. I like the wider handle because it doesn‚Äôt fall through the silverware basket.
I hate the back of this set. It was not shown. I am very disappointed.
These are the best! Love them.
Like the weight and sturdiness of the utensils!
We have been looking for these for a while. I have trouble holding the smaller flatware. This works famously. NO DROPSIES!
Muy agradables
Evidently Onieda no longer produces a quality product. Flatware rusts after a couple washings! Quality stainless flatware should NOT RUST with normal use! Had my other flatware for 7+ years and it doesn't rust. Let it sit in box to long to return now. Won't be buying Onieda ever again....what a waste of money!
"Ok for everyday, expected better quality with Oneida brand but then again they weren't that expensive. With some rust and minor pitting on a few pieces I would not expect the set to last decades."
They are ok at best
Very nice flatware. Sturdy
We have been using this flatware for two months and the finish has started to come off and rust in spots. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the quality of this set as they have not lasted at all. We are not rough on these pieces. They are for day to say use at our home.
The handles of the knives rusted after the first wash. DO NOT BUY. The stainless steel is a lie.
Nice value but heavy to hold.
My Oneida from 30 years ago is better than this Oneida! Wish I kept the old pattern. Returned due to rust spots after washing in my Bosch dishwasher.
"It was posted as highly polished, But the majority of the metal was a matte surface, easily marked, harder to clean"
"These were a house warming gift and as thrilled as we were with our purchase, these utensils have turned out to be very disappointing. There must be something wrong with the finish because they are rusting after one wash. It appears this purchase has been a waste of money and a disappointing, defective gift.  Too bad. Will advise others to avoid this product for sure, as a bunch of brand new, rusting utensils is no good."
Would have been better If the serving pieces were either included or available. Otherwise don't purchase!
We've only had the set for a month and noticed rust on the knife handles. I don't use a dishwasher. They weren't sitting in water for any length of time. I handwash them. Each knife has the same bit of rust. Very disappointed that the Oneida name is not longer the quality I remember. Sad.
Good looking good weight in your hand. Chipped sides on some of them. Send back
"The product itself seems fine but the packaging is awful. It honestly looks like this is a returned product because someone very clearly and forcefully open the product. There's even tape on the box trying to keep it closed. All pieces were there but my confidence in the product is very, very low"
I am very disappointed in the lack of quality. I‚Äôve always bought Oneida. Have pieces from a set from 50 years ago and 25 years ago. I‚Äôve never had the discoloration as I have had from this set after only a few months. Would not purchase again
"The knives, spoons, and forks have begun to show rust through the plating after about one month of use. The directions for use and cleaning were followed and now had to discard one knife during to plating pealing off and creating a sharp protrusion that would cut your hand."
I like the design and the spoon size but it‚Äôs already tarnishing after only a few months
Rusted at the bottom of the handle after the first wash and I returned as defective. I thought some of the other reviewers were overstating it but no. These are garbage. Do not buy.
"I ordered this dinner flatware set thinking it was the same quality as the one I ordered several years ago. No where near the quality of my original set. Won't repurchase it, very flimsy and started to show rust spots after only a few weeks. Not worth a penny. I would not recommend it."
"After my silverware washed in the dishwasher and getting them out, they have rust on them!"
Rusted after one use. Ridiculous
It‚Äôs over priced. I didn‚Äôt like bc It‚Äôs very hard to grab. I saw even better Design and lower price is available. I don‚Äôt recommend anybody to buy.
"Had the set for 6 months. The knives started rusting first, now the forks and spoons are rusting. I'd appreciate my money back on such a junk product."
"2 small spoons have sharp edges, one big spoon has nasty scratches on it. not happy we ordered another set and had one more spoon with sharp edges. china junk!"
Good feel... but rusting is disappointing
Knife handles rusted after 2 washes
Barely used and rust and Nick's are already on them
"I bought 2 sets of the 20 piece about 5 years ago. I really like the deep indention all the way through the handle. The weight is balanced and size is appropriate for everyday meals.  On a (XS, S, M, L, XL) I would consider the ultra cheap forks at a shady restaurant a XS to S. The cheapo college stuff a S to M. The really big oversize stuff used once a year an XL. And most nice white table cloth restaurants use a L to XL full size utensils. These are not as heavy or as large as a white table cloth restaurant but just a tick beneath it. Dishwasher and everyday use has worn the matte a little but again matte on these were never really chalky and rough but more aesthetics of brushed steel vs polished steel.  Also only the underside padding of your thumb really touches anything matte so its not displeasing or distracting. The underside of the handle is all polished steel.  This is my 4-5th full set (service for 8) of flatware over the last 16 years. My issue is we loose teaspoons like crazy in my house. Of this set, I have 8 knives, 8 L forks, 7 S forks, 6 L spoons, 3 S spoons. This design as far as I can tell doesn't offer bulk teaspoons. I'm deciding if I want to purchase two bulk sets just to get extra spoons or switch to a different pattern that readily have bulk teaspoons available."
"I purchased these maybe 3, 5 years ago, time flies and not easy to search for older orders on Amazon. We do not use them often unless they are the last in the drawer. The reasoning behind them being shunned is that they constantly fall off the plate or whatever they are resting on or even out of your hand. They are poorly balanced. They are heavy. They have been through the dishwasher, spoons many times with no rust or imperfections. They just don't want to stay on the plate. They like to dive bomb to carpet or concrete when bbq ing."
"This set is reasonably priced, attractive enough, and easy to hold."
"I really like the quality of Oneida flat water. However, the butter knives in this set has started to get rust spots less than two weeks of purchase."
"Good weight, plenty of items in purchase. Great for everyday meals!"
"This pattern is very hard to find. Excellent condition, arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described by the seller."
"They look very nice, but after one cycle in the dishwasher the knives have gone rusty, sending back for a full refund, very disappointed"
"I purchased this set to replace pieces I've lost over the years, as I already owned a set in this pattern. I thought they seemed a little lighter/thinner, but didn't think much of it as the pattern really was a perfect match. As recommended in the care tips, I immediately hand-washed and dried the set before using them for the first time, but rust began developing immediately, especially on the knife handles. I will not be keeping this set."
I seem to be working fine
"I‚Äôve had my set for 10 years. I was missing a few pieces so ordered these. They match mine but look older - possibly used? - some tarnishing and not as shiny. Overall, there are enough that look good enough to replace my missing ones."
"This was a second attempt at getting decent flatware - and it was the right choice. Its classic yet modern. It is sturdy enough (which was the problem with the other set I ordered from a no-name mfg) for daily use). I have had no issues with water staining or rust spots - been using daily and washing in dishwasher. Large spoon is huge - and teaspoon is large - so might not be great for feeding the little ones in your life, we are all adults so not a concern. Very pleased with finish and appearance.  UPDATE - 3 months of use and the knives are rusting!!! I am so disappointed. I am going to reach out to Mikasa and see if they will replace this set.  Been using for a few months - and we are now seeing rust spots appearing on the handles/blades. Super upsetting as Mikasa has a good reputation. Liked the design - but quality is lacking."
"I've wanted this set for so long. Found the set, albeit a little more expensive than I wanted to spend. Had a gift card which helped and ordered. Quick delivery."
The styling of the flatware is lovely. The pieces are sturdy but not overpowering and goes very well with the French Countryside dinnerware. I would recommend this flatware.
It has a nice weight in the hand. You can tell it is quality from the hand feel. The container is also very nice. I'm quite pleased.
This is the best silverware set we've ever owned. Very sturdy and heavy. I just wish I could find somewhere where I could get more pieces because I would like more teaspoons.
"This set is sturdy, heavy and I have washed several times, no rust. All of the pieces are very well made. It was everything that i expected."
"Very impressed with the quality of this flatware, the fast service from the seller, and a very good price! Of the 65 pieces I rec'd, I did not find one ""flaw"".........which is sorta amazing. We love the weight, the design and how easy it is to use/hold. Much prettier than the picture, this is not cheap flatware, very good value for the money IMO. Thanks Amazon!!!!"
I really like the sturdiness of this silverware. It's not flimsy or too light-weight. The design is great. It looks nice on my table. I will be purchasing additional pieces.
"Great design, strength and finish quality - just what you expect from Mikasa. All pieces just feel right in the hand and complement any table setting from breakfast to dinner party."
Nice weight. Love the style.
beautiful simple design. Love this flatware set
I love this silverware. Matches the set we got for our wedding 7 years ago. Very durable and pretty. Came on time great deal.
"I am so pleased with this purchase. They are very pretty and not too heavy or too light. They feel good in the hand. Well made. I've been married for 30 years and have used older inherited, well made stainless silverware. I love my old stuff but over the years would buy ""extras"" from the local stores which were never the same, they would get spotty and never felt right. These are so nice and they are my own. Highly recommend them and I believe they would be a great gift."
This set is very pretty and looks great with the Mikasa French Country dishes which I love. The teaspoons are cupped more than my previous set which I prefer to use for soups rather than the larger soup spoon. Very nice set.
"Long sleek lines, of appropriate weight, and feels good in the hand. Excellent quality in my opinion."
"Bought this as a gift, and it was such a hit - and such great quality - that I immediately purchased another set for us."
"Nice heft and balance to these utensils. I bought them to go with the Mikasa Italian Countryside Dinnerware and I think they go together well. Simple in design, but definitely with an air of class, not cheap..."
"I purchased this flatware set to replace an older Mikasa set that was missing a few pieces. Either this set is a counterfeit or Mikasa sucks now! I'm embarrassed to show my flatware. It started with the knives. They started showing spots and I polished them with a soft cloth but they would not go away. Eventually those spots turned into rust spots. Now the small spoons are doing the same. I did not treat my flatware in any unusually harsh way. I washed them by hand and dishwasher, just like any reasonable person would do. I dried them before putting them away. I advice anyone looking to purchase Mikasa to think twice. I'm going to look into their limited lifetime warranty and see if anything can be done. If there's no recourse with their warranty I will just replace them with another brand. I'm so disappointed! Please take time to look at my pictures."
This stainless silverware is very nice and is a great weight. It is on the heavier side which I love and it is very durable. Highly recommend! I loved it so much that I purchased it for our second home as well.
Very happy with the purchase! Nice quality flatware.
Beautiful stainless. Elegant and simple. Nice weight to them. Love them.
"Promptly arrived, all pieces were included, great price - FAR more affordable than other sellers."
We have the French countryside dinnerware and wanted utensils to fit. These make it complete.
Finally a great quality at great price.
A+
Great everyday stainless.
"Elegant style and very compatible. Stunning appearance with a high polish and smooth in every detail of finishing. Sturdy with ergonomic balance. Removed from dishwasher spotless and looking exactly new after a full cleaning cycle from original plastic covers.  Thrilled that I finally discovered these long-needed replacements for my 25-year+ previous Oneida service. These are even better made! I am impressed with the attention to detail.  Update: After a half dozen dishwasher cleanings, every detail on every piece of service looks absolutely stunning and new.  Also, sooo many compliments!"
I absolutely love the quality and look of this set. Nice and balanced.
Very disappointing that the knives rusted at the handle after the first wash. Not happy with the finish and expected a much higher quality from Mikasa. The flatware shows every little finger print and they are hard to keep looking nice.
Exactly as described and shipped lighting fast.
Product arrived on time and was as described.
VERY NICE
Made my Thanksgiving great
"I got these to go with the French Countryside dinnerware set. They look beautiful together. This silverware feels like it is made to last. They are large, heavy, and very strong. The knives have a nice sharpness. Instructions on the box, recommend taking just the knives out of the dishwasher at the start of the heated dry cycle, and drying them by hand. This extra little step does not bother me, if it keeps my beautiful knives in good shape."
"My friends have this set and I have always admired it so finally bought it. My friends have had their set for over 10 years and they still look new (except for a spoon that fell down into the garbage disposal). When I unpacked the set I noticed a couple ""dings"" but decided to keep them anyway. However, I've only been using the utensils for about a month and the scuff marks/scratches are just increasing. I really like the look (from a distance) and weight of the pieces. Think I just got a set with poor finish. Donated my old set already so gonna keep this one and try to ignore the marks. Expected alot more from a Mikasa product though."
As advertised
"This is a good set of silverware that I expect will last for many years to come. Getting the 65-piece set for under $100 was a very good deal. The pattern is non-offensive and, so far, the dishwasher keeps them very clean and shiny.  And now for the other factors YOU need to consider before buying. This stuff Is very heavy. These pieces are very large. The tablespoon is the same size as the serving spoon from my previous set. There is very little difference in size between the dinner and salad fork.  Would I recommend them? Sure--read the first sentence of my review."
"Disappointing. I bought the 65-piece set (Shipped and sold by Amazon.com) and found that almost every piece had a polishing defect in the handle or the tines. Out of 65 pieces, 54 (!!!) either had incomplete polishing (which can lead to rusting, like the photo someone else has posted) or misaligned grooves around the pattern in the handle. Nothing wrong with the weight and material, and I love the pattern ‚Äî so elegant! The large dinner spoons are huge though, almost like serving spoons.  I called Mikasa customer service and they just told me to return it. Is Mikasa quality so poor nowadays, or is Amazon selling factory rejects/knockoffs again? Either way, won‚Äôt be using these."
"This flatware is stainless steel with a beautiful chrome satin finish. The pieces have heft to them and feel substantial in the hand. Since it is an 8 person setting, you can afford to loose a piece or two and still have table coverage for the average family. I enjoy eating with this flatware every meal, it looks and feels so nice I feel satisfaction in buying it, knowing it was money well spent and will last for many years."
I've had these for several months now and I'm very happy. They look good and are a good value. They have a decent weight to them and they feel good in the hand. I recommend them with no reservations.
"One should beware that these products are not the same size as the original Mikasa French Countryside. I bought this to help round out my old set, and they are not the same size. Disappointing. I will donate them to someone who can use them, but make sure you know before you buy if that is your goal."
Overall adequate flatware. With ongoing use have noted a few rust spots and easy scratching despite being washed only in a dishwasher with individual slots in a flatware tray.
"Don‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher. Hand wash and towel dry. The handles are starting to rust on mine. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a very sturdy set."
Pretty pattern. Not very well balanced and a little too heavy. Water stains easily and needs to be hand dried to be spotless. The price I paid was exceptionally good for 18/10 stainless.
"I love Mikasa, I ordered these to match some of my formal dinnerware and this pairs beautifully with my Italian Countryside. Very good quality, heavy, and sturdy."
Beautiful and nice heavier weight!
"I purchased a similar Mikasa set from Costco 5 years ago and with daily use, they still look brand new. My Mom ordered this set and it arrived as expected. It is a beautiful set of high quality with a sturdy wooden case."
"a lovely set of flatware. Amazing quality, just heavy and make sure you house them on a low shelf and not a drawer, the entire set is rather heavy. Youre going to live them!"
"The main issue when shopping for new silverware was it had to be comfortable for my husband. Our other silver all has squared off bottoms, and he is very ucomfortable usuing these . These were much better, plus, I will only buy 18/10 stainless steel."
This product started rusting the first time washed. So much for stainless steel.
"This flatware was exactly what I was hoping for. Great price, nice weight and lovely. I'm very hsppy."
"Bought this to replace old mix match flatware. Not disappointed, very shiny heavy weight set. Hope it lasts without rust and scratching! Will update after daily use."
Hard to pick out silverware without holding it first...but this set is totally what I was looking for. Excellent weight and balance. Love the geometric design. Looks great not only on the table but even in the drawer. Washes so well. Highly recommend.
Can‚Äôt go wrong with silverware by Mikasa. They are elegant looking as well as sturdy. Price is right too!!
"I ALWAYS LOVED MIKASA PRODUCTS AND THIS SET IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY PRODUCE. IT IS VERY RICH LOOKING, CLEANS WELL, IS DISHWASHER SAFE, AND CAN BE DRESSY OR C ASUAL."
Best silverware set I‚Äôve ever bought
"Gorgeous silverware. Purchased as a gift for my parents. It has a nice feel, not too heavy, smooth finish. Feels sophisticated, like what you'd find in an upscale restaurant."
"The silverware themselves are a bit larger when handling as previous views mentioned however, the quality of the set is what makes it impressive and why the feel is different. If you like the feel of flimsy silverware, then you will not enjoy the quality of these pieces. I have small grandchildren who do just find using the utensils to eat with."
We are very happy with this purchase
to small
"I love the product because I like what I like! I had a set I purchased 6 years ago....I think...Maybe it was 5 years ago. So I have kids and about 20% of my pieces were missing so I purchased another set and now I have extra! Same set I have had and I love it. It is classic, well balanced in the hand on and on the plate."
"I love the heaviness and weight of this cutlery. I was housesitting for a friend who had Mikasa and loved rich feel of it. Not flimsy. So when I was in the market, Mikasa is where I started looking. I'm very happy with it."
We had just moved and were hosting thanksgiving. Our old flatware did not make the move. Saw this on Amazon. It is nice and pleasantly hefty to the touch. Not cheap looking. Made for a great holiday table. Good purchase.
Absolutely love this silverware set! The entire setup and caddy were in excellent condition!
"Just received and haven't put into use yet, but love the look, the weight. Very pleased. The spoons are ridiculously large, but that's the trend with all flatware."
"Rust spots after only a couple of uses. However, there they are good and heavy with good looks."
"Love, love, love the French Countryside 65-Piece 18/10 stainless steel flatware set. This is service for 12 with serving utensil set. Very pleased with the purchase. They are Lovely and a great quality!"
Love this silverware! It is prettier than in the pictures. It is well balanced and comfortable in your hand. Very well packed and fast shipping.
These are more beautiful than the photos express. They're hefty--not for small hands. I appreciate the storage tray that comes with the flatware.
Excellent quality. Very smooth finish and excellent shine. Holds up well to repeated dishwasher cleaning.
"These are so wonderful and they come with the silverware tray (that we didn't need but are appreciative of). However, when I ordered these, I thought they were a flat matte black. Turns out they are a shiny black, but we ended up loving them anyway and have learned to read further. My mistake, but for future buyers who also maybe didn't read full description and just looked at the photos!"
"I got these to go with my Home Hero professional knife set and man, they look good!!  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt see the size of the tray and it doesn‚Äôt fit in my kitchen drawer, so I had to get a new one. But the silverware is sleek!  To anyone who needs the Tray dimensions: Length: 13.3 inches Width: 11.4 inches"
"I will say that these are beautiful but they are absolutely not matte black. I purchased specifically because I was looking for matte. I will say though that if you are looking for mirror black these are made well, heavy weight to them and I don‚Äôt doubt will last a long time."
"This set arrived quickly and was nicer than I anticipated, especially at the low price. The dinnerware feels very comfortable in the hand... nice weight, thickness and beautiful, smooth finish. The divided tray it comes in is of a store-bought quality and easily fit into my drawer. I love the no-slip pads on the bottom of each compartment. I may well order another set of this to have extras for guests and/or replacements. It would make a great gift item as well."
"Very good set of silverware for the indifferent customer or the newly single.  The one drawback is that the finish isn't super sturdy. I have used these for a couple months now and most of them are so tarnished, they're trying to claim the Elden Ring."
"Came with each silverware piece wrapped individually. They seem to be a good weight. Big forks and spoons seem huge, but that‚Äôs ok, I actually like the long handles. Tray came cracked, wish it would have been wrapped in bubble wrap better. Edit: reached out to customer service, they were responsive and more than happy to assist me with the broken tray. Might buy another set!"
Have been using this set for 4 months now and the finish looks as good as the day I took them out of the packaging. I was really worried that it would wear off and look bad over time. I am happy with this set of silverware. It seems to be made of quality materials and will hold up to years of use.
Appears really nice & sturdy. Washed a couple of times and they're still shinning.
The silverware is great but the tray came busted and cracked. I don't necessarily want to return it because it took a while to get here and I am tired of using silverware out of a box.
I decided to change out my silverware and I am so glad I got these. I‚Äôve run them through the dishwasher several times now and they look good as new.
"Great set of dinnerware, look great, feel great. Only issue for me is 1 knife was missing. I contacted seller and told they would refund $3. What? I guess if I ever have 3 guest I will just put the $3 on the place mat inplace of the knife. That's fine!"
I like this. Simple. Easy to clean. Each utensil comes in a plastic wrap with a rubber band which kind of is a waste of packaging. Besides that this will do what we need it for. It‚Äôs not a high end set I would use for a fancy dinner but they do the job.
"These set of silverware is awesome! I was worried the would scratch, peel or stain. NO they do not! I live in the country have really bad hard water. The silverware is the only items I don‚Äôt have to check. Literally no water stains or spots. I plan on buying more. Defiantly worth the buy!"
"Esta muy bonito el producto. Tomar en cuanta lo siguiente: ‚Ä¢No son mate, tiene brillo y cuando los tienes puedes que veas que el color se vea claro. En el caso de los de color negro. ‚Ä¢Me llegaron intactos, sin rayones, cada pieza viene con una bolsita. ‚Ä¢El almacenador que trae no trae para tapar, se tiene que comprar uno para guardarlos en mi caso asi seria, para que no este expuesto a insectos(cucarachas) o sucio.  Es un producto muy bueno, me sorprende lo bien que me llego a Hondurasüá≠üá≥"

"This is my favorite silverware set I've ever purchased, the black is gorgeous and fits the overall look of my other kitchenware perfectly."
They are very pretty but make sure to clean them with a soft sponge and nothing scrubby. The coloring began to come off after cleaning.
"Having moved to senior communities where meals were not provided needed smaller amount of utensils, along with many other items. These are strong, stylish, and entirely functional."
First set came in the plastic tray was broken. Replacement arrived next day. The set is perfect for my basement in law suite.
Was hesitant because of the great price but I love my new silverware set!! The tray is sturdy and super cute and all of the silverware is very durable. Also looked brand new after dishwasher uses.
"Love the look of this flatware, looks expensive. Fits in my draw perfectly."
They look great and you get a variety and good quantity. So cute and different.
"I know some people were disappointed that they are ""mirror"" and not ""matte"" black but honestly I could care less. They're plain, shiny, black utensils. Affordable but good quality and the perfect amount for a single person household. (Although you can get two if you want to be a little lax on the dishes!)"
this set is exactly what I needed. Metal is great! The container was even better.
GIFT - she loved these to go with her gold-edged dishes. This purchase from us to our friends made them very happy. I'm p leased.
durable silverware holder love it! they are so pretty washed several times and still black! color seems to hold up! they are perfect size as well.
I bought these for my wife who LOVES anything black. Was a little skeptical on hpw durable the finish would be in the dishwasher. Ive had these for about a month and have seen no signs of the finish fading in the dishwasher.
"I love these so much. My husband and I purchased this set for our new home. They are sturdy, the perfect thickness and at the same time, lightweight! I love that it comes with the case so that drawer storage is easy."
"Washed 2x, no noticeable discoloration or rusting. Seems to be high quality so far."
Really nice actually pleasantly surprised by the weight and thickness. They‚Äôre a mirror type black as another reviewer said. However it‚Äôs still nice and I think a deal with the organizer included.
"This was a gift for my brother's first apartment. So far, he really likes them. I just hope they stay black after several washes. I appreciate how it even comes with a silverware tray."
"This silverware set is a great value for the money. The black finish isn't matte, but also not overly shiny. The silverware holder is of decent construction. Hard to beat for the overall cost."
Just moved into a new apt and didn‚Äôt want old stuffy looking stuff. This looks sleek. And does it job of shoving food into my mouth. Highly recommend
"Decent size variety, handles the dishwasher fine, and they are sturdy enough to stand up to being kidnapped by the great dane without snapping in two."
Love these! Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy and a great value.
Black stainless set for 4 is actually gunmetal gray but came with great tray. I bought a second set to have service for eight and a second tray
Love the silverware! The color is very cute and they are very sturdy and dishwasher safe
This is a great looking set of utensils. I just moved to a new place and didn‚Äôt want the same old thing. I ended up buying a second set so I‚Äôd have settings for 8.
"Great set for the money for sure! However, if water spots bother you, then black is probably not the best idea."
They were prettier than the pictures. They have a very nice shine and are not a matte finish.
"Standard, simple silverware tray that suits my silverware needs. Haha"
Nice
"i was looking for something not that expensive and good looking, they are a great buy"
"This flatware is just what I was looking for. Not too light weight, so it doesn't bend. Not too bulky or heavy, fits well in my small hands."
I wanted to replace my old flatware set and this did the job. it's pretty and functional
"I ordered this set for my son who had gotten his own place. The set is sturdy and perfect for him. The price was good, then I saw that there were a lot of similar type sets for about half the price at Walmart. Phooey. It was still a good product and glad that I got it!"
I am surprised at how nice this silverware set is. I have been looking for a set to replace the old cheap pieces I had and this was worth the buy. They are very sturdy and feel like a really expensive set without the extreme price.
"Good weight, durable and I love the black!"
This silverware set is great! Good solid metal feel in your hand. Nice look and finish !
"Bought this set for the RV - nice value for the price, and works well as a second set for travel."
Love them
I love it it goes with my kitchen but I wish it was more in there
Great and is just like picture.
So far so good. I‚Äôve ran them through my dishwasher and they come out looking like they did the first day I opened the package. Sturdy and they do not bend.
Love this product! Had to buy it again! Look great and feel comfy and solid.
"Beautiful and functional, coating"
I love this set. It is Trudy and very pretty.
Absolutely love this set and comes with nice tray
Would be good for first apartment
Very gorgeous. I wish they had an option that came with more in a set.
It was a gift to my son and he loved it!
I was looking for a matte black set similar to the magnolia line at target but at a cheaper price point. These are a shiny black but great quality!
Love the look the weight the tray !!! üíñ exactly what I needed!
I like it
Really great
Works and holds up great!  Dishwasher safe - So far!
I love them. Thankful for the honest reviews because I absolutely love them. I want another set !! you won‚Äôt be disappointed
I‚Äôm obsessed. Never going back to silverware again.
Have cooked with these and washed them a few times and still look brand new. Love these
"Very very sturdy, very good price for what you get."
This simple yet sturdy set of stainless was a gift to my daughter who had lost all of the teaspoons to her old set. Looking to replace her teaspoons we found this set and it was cheaper to replace the entire set than to replace the old spoons. We were both very pleased with this set. Now she can serve in style without mismatched settings!!
Nice and heavy and beautiful. Will buy again
"This is neither satin or shiny - it's a combination of both. Because several other purchasers said this set was in fact shiny, I purchased it to add to my existing set. It's nice quality, don't get me wrong, but the intent was to have a service for 16 that matched....and when I looked into returning, they were going to charge me $10.00 to ship it back. So I am keeping it, but I am very disappointed. I am including a picture of the sugar spoon, showing the shiny one from my original set, along with the spoon from the new set, so others can get a better idea of what it actually looks like before buying, as the pictures from the seller really don't show it well.... :("
"Good feel. Sturdy. Tried to buy a cheaper brand (50% less), but ended up buying these."
"Not the heavyweight cutlery of the Oneida brand that I was used to. This particular style wasn't what I thought it would be, based on the picture.There back of the utensils is indented rather than flat, so it was hard for me to grip. I returned the set. Amazon was great about processing the return credit."
has a nice weight to it that I like.
"One fork was moderately damaged. Amazon referred me to manufacturers page. No warranty mentioned on that page. I suppose I must call Oneida to find out. The warranty might have been on the packaging. Unfortunately, I threw that away because I've never had a problem with Oneida's quality before. I am completely happy with this product otherwise."
"Scratches easily. The weight is good and balanced in the hand. Beautiful set. Just a little disappointed how easily they scratch. Good value, though."
"I love this set! They are nice looking, but not overly fancy. They have decent weight without feeling super heavy. Very pleased!"
"Do NOT waste your money! I previously had an Oneida ‚ÄúSurge‚Äù cutlery set, which gave me a good 7yrs of daily use, but it‚Äôs glossy stainless steel finish became very dull over time; which led me to order this new Oneida ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù set. It‚Äôs literally been 3 weeks of use, the handles on the forks are already beginning to RUST! I am in disbelief, unfortunately I passed the return deadline. Beyond disappointed, $100 down the drain. In addition to the RUST, this set is much lighter and seems flimsy compared to my previous set. Needless to say I will now have to do some research for a new brand of reliable cutlery to purchase, as I refuse to put out rusty utensils for my family and guests."
Beautiful  Very comfy to hold and washing great
"Nice silverware, but came with scratches on several of them. Disappointed, these were not cheap and I expected better from Oneida. Several have scratches towards the bottom of the piece. I don't think that's acceptable. Other than that, they're well made and a nice weight, good feel in my hands. Just think that they should come in and be free of scratches."
Good looking set that my fiance and I could both agree on. Wish it was a little more shiney though.
"I was under the impression these had a satin finish. They are in fact a mirrored finish with partial satin finished handles. Heavy and sturdy set, just a little disappointed I didn't get what I really wanted esthetically, especially for the price"
"We bought these to replace our old Oneida flatware, but I'm not really pleased. Why on earth are they so small? The new tablespoon is about the size of our old teaspoon. I've included a photo of the new tablespoon on the left and the old tablespoon on the right. My husband said it will take him forever to finish a bowl of soup or cereal with the new spoon so we kept the old tablespoons. Kind of defeats the purpose. Even the forks are tiny. What on earth???"
Beautiful flatware with an artistic flair.
My son loved this silverware snd removed his other silverware.
"I recently gifted my daughter with this Lincoln pattern , 8 place setting set. She is completely thrilled with the feel/weight, quality and finish of this cutlery. She was very pleased to have its included meat fork, both slotted and solid veggie serving spoons AND a matching butter knife."
"Tarnishing badly, unable to clean off the tarnish and rusting spots. Am throwing items away. I bought these as it was an Amazon Choice. They washed and dried well for about 2 weeks and then the discoloring, tarnishing, and appearance of ""rusting"" appeared and that is hard to clean off even with scrub pads. The tarnish gets between the tines on the forks so am throwing those away. I used these daily, but not now and am using my old old set of silverware that I was replacing with the Massugar flatware. Please be aware of my experience."
This silverware rusts. A lot. The first time I put it in the dishwasher all of the knives came out with the rust in between each little serrated spot on them. Then the spoons and forks started to rust as well. Now I‚Äôm having to use barkeepers friend on silverware that I run through the dishwasher. This is ridiculous.
This silverware set has a great weight and is nice and sturdy. Amazing value!
"The estimate for delivery for this was unusually long, given the current troubles with COVID, but then despite that this cutlery set was delivered within 2 days. So kudos to all involved for that.  As far as the product, it's excellent. Simple, solid, good quality, easy to clean, durable, a good value for the money."
I lucked up with these! Of course like everyone I read the reviews. I saw all the bad ones and still decided to take a chance. And I was definitely impressed. Silverware came exactly as described and shown on the pics. Even after several washes it‚Äôs still looks brand new. No rust like others mentioned. This is a perfectly stainless steel silverware set. You won‚Äôt be disappointed
Wonderfully and individually wrapped pieces of silverware. I highly recommend this product. I love the great usability of these items as I can use a dessert spoon and smaller fork when needed. Love it.
"I'm moving and picked this set up to make sure I had had some flat ware after the move. Pretty decent, I like the forks and knives in this set. I thought the big spoons were table spoons but they're larger, more like a small serving spoon. I believe the smaller spoons are tablespoons, I thought they would be tea spoons. All good though, I have use for some serving spoons too!"
This silverware set is exactly what we needed for our apartment. Practical. Gets food from the plate to the mouth incredibly efficiently. I love it!!
"flatware somehow goes missing like stray socks in our household. ‚Äî Was tired of running low & quickly ordered this set. I figured either they would OK, or at least get us by until I could shop for something better. I really wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect for such a low price. ‚Äî Received them, and was very happy. No need to look any further (for now, haha).  Good quality for good price."
"As a law student, I could not afford to expend much on a set of silverware. Picked up this set for about $15 here on Amazon, but frankly did not expect much due to the low cost. Boy, was I surprised! This is an attractive and functional set I will not be ashamed to utilize when friends visit. I'm quite pleased with this item purchased at such a reasonable cost."
I love these utensils I will continue to purchase these in the future. The quality is so durable and so easy to clean. The price is amazing considering the quality of them. The is the second time I have purchased this item. I wouldn't have had to replace the last set I bought last year had my children not misplaced/thrown them away. I highly recommend this product.
"These are perfect for large hands. I ran them thru the dishwasher and they did just fine. They are heavy in weight but not to heavy to hold. I was just looking for a set of four to add to my daily set cause we go thru alot of silverware. it came wrap in plastic each piece, and was in a sturdy box. I am very pleased with my purchase. Would buy again if need be."
"Before I even opened the package, I knew these were going to be good. The box weighed a ton! These are heavy and sturdy. They aren't going to bend easily, they don't have plastic parts to break off. They don't seem to tarnish easily, either. I can tell that we will be very happy with this set for many years to come!"
I needed a starter set for my new place. I like this simple design. It‚Äôs easy to hold and clean. Seems like it should last quite a while. i‚Äôm very happy with what I got for the price.
These are nicer than expected for the money. They are sturdy and don‚Äôt bend when you put them in hot liquids like similar ones in this price range. I recommend this set!
We LOVE this set. Some people won‚Äôt like how small the smaller spoons and forks are but we love them because we have small kiddos. The large spoons and forks are large so you won‚Äôt be eating with toddler utensils at all. This is perfect for our family
"I purchased these for my son who is moving into his first apartment. They are simple, but classy. Beautiful."
Very good quality for the price! They look good and do the job! I would definitely recommend this as a purchase.
"Needed silverware for the RV. Excellent quality, clean and appealing style, sturdy and long-lasting...just what I needed. Seller was excellent and the value for the price was super!"
These fit in your hand nicely and they are thin and light without feeling cheap. I like these better than the last expensive set we bought.
"I needed new silverware. Love everything about it; it‚Äôs well made ,easy to hold and a great price. I bought the setting for 8 first and ordered the setting for four."
The package came fast. It was very organized and clean. It was more than what I expected and would recommend it.
"Good stuff. Great for the price. It arrived 2 or 3 days early. Can't complain. I gave 3 stars on sturdy. It is fine, yes there is harder tougher metal utensils but, it is for eating, not killing barbarians. It will hold up great if you are a human using it appropriately."
The product looked very nice. Easy to hold and very sturdy. Looked just like the pick and was great for the price
"This is a very nicely made, sturdy silverware set. Great for the price, better than I expected. Nice, solid, thick molded set. Nothing skimpy about it. Very happy with the purchase."
"This silverware is great. It feels smooth, it‚Äôs weighted well so that it doesn‚Äôt take a dive off your plate, and it‚Äôs just shiny enough to look nice. I can‚Äôt imagine you can find a better-quality set for the price."
These were exactly what I expected. I wanted a new utensil set and this showed up early and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. Multiple sizes of forks and spoons for different occasions also.
"Bought this for 3 of my roommates and I and I've been using it for the past couple of days. The silverware is pretty high quality, very sturdy, and easy to clean. One thing I would note is that the knives are pretty long, a bit longer than the size that would fit in our silverware tray, but otherwise it's great."
I sent this overnight to a friend in an Air BnB that was poorly furnished. They were thrilled and said these have a nice weight to them and are a pleasure to use...good quality for a reasonable price.
Bought this for a shower gift since it was on registry. Seem to be a good sturdy set.
I gave the silverware for Christmas gifts and received extremely great thank you and the recipients were greatly impressed with the silverware sets.
"The silverware pieces feel sturdy in the hand, have a nice long reach, and look good. They are everything I had hoped they would be. I'm already considering getting a second set."
Great quality silverware
Bought these for my sister for Christmas
"Love the silverware set. Understated, just made for my taste, but beautiful. My husband likes that the fork is as long as it is...he can reach my plate easier!!! Wonderful buy for the price."
I redid my kitchen and wanted something simple and basic. These are great. The big forks and spoons are for giants...then again I am a small person. I only use the regular sized ones.
"Bright, appears tough and durable. Appears to be very sturdy, unable to bend( unlike some silverware I‚Äôve had ). Very simple even elegant design,"
Very good silverware. Thank you.
Perfect for me. Very good product and sturdy. A must for a young couple
"I got tired of not finding utensils. Apparently, my forever permanent guest (family) believe forks and knives go in the trash. I wanted something inexpensive, strong and good quality."
"Much nicer than I expected! They're nice, clean up well, and are sturdy!"
"My son had kept ""accidentally "" throwing away our utensils, so we wanted something to replace our current set, and these are wonderful. They're very durable, and a good product. Would definitely recommend, and shipping was extremely quick!"
"Set arrived on time, well put together, and all utensils were present and well made"
Bought for my daughter who uses them daily. Nice weight & sturdy. Easy to clean & durable. Recommend
Great set! They are durable and sturdy (no bending!) Cleans well in the dishwasher.
Very nice even after a few months
"Sturdy, lightweight and looks great. Grate buy."
Very nice set does well in the dishwasher no discoloration or tarnish
"I was looking for a beautiful sturdy/heavy set of silverware for my new apartment and came across these. I have always had high standards for silverware & these exceeded my expectations. They‚Äôre heavy, they look really good and the sizes are perfect (for me)"
Amazing for how much the cost will buy again
It even matched my old set. These will last for years. fast delivery. Great seller.
"This silverware set is so good, that every time I use it, I'm thinking to myself, just how the fork am I so lucky?"
Very sturdy and nice for the price. O was very satisfied with the quality.
"I love these, will buy a set for my daughter. Very easy to clean ."
Love these so much the quality is great!
"Bought these for my parents for the busy summer season! So far so good. They‚Äôre strong and get the job done. Haven‚Äôt seen any rusting yet, bought them a few months ago."
Great set of silverware. Easy to grab and hold on to. The pieces don't slip or turn in your hand. Pieces are easy to clean and are very durable. Very happy with this purchase.
This silverware set was pretty cheap in price but not in manufacture. They are a bit light weight but they still look good and handle comfortably. I really like them.
"Not extremely heavy but just right, IMO, for everyday use including using with guests. Sturdy, dishwasher safe and maintain their shine."
Love these! Great quality!
I purchased these for my mother and she is very satisfied with them. Good price for a set.
This is the best. You won‚Äôt regret it
Looks nice. More petite than the usual I buy. They were sold out. So I bought these and no one complained. Weight and look are good.
Great quality set. Washed daily in the dishwasher and still look new.
Soft and great size easy to clean
Perfect as I hoped. All items were delivered on time and will be used for many years to come. 5 stars highly recommend.
So far so good. My mother-in-law loves them.
Great quality for the price
"This set has decent weight to it, doesn't easily bend or damage and doesn't get hung up in the holes of the dishwasher rack!"
Great set of utensils at a great price!
Very heavy well made. It's a very simple design but very elegant. Love the sizes and how many you get for the price is amazing!!
"This silverware is awesome! I bought a set of it about 4 years ago and somehow my kids have lost all but 3 of the forks and spoons, so I finally ordered another set. Every piece has held up very well to my crazy family. I hadn't two special needs children who are very hard on everything, but I've never had a problem. And what I love most of that 4 years after my original purchase I was still about to purchase the exact same pattern/design, so all my silverware still match. You can't even tell the difference between what is new and what is 4 years old. It all looks exactly the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Needed new flatware for multiple people. The weight is better than expected and the handles on each piece are designed well for handling.
These were so nice. Arrived insanely fast. The only thing that I would have liked more is for the spoons to be smaller. They are so big. I find this a lot in sets and wish they would include smaller spoons. Why do people need such giant spoons to eat with? Odd but otherwise very nice.
These are very good quality. I was worried due to the price. The are thick and string and size is average to me. They don‚Äôt look fake like some poor quality silver does. If you need silverware get these! You won‚Äôt regret it.
"This silverware set at first was strange as it came in a small rectangle box, but the material is sturdy and very beautiful."
The stainless set arrived in a timely manner. It was in perfect condition and looks beautiful.
The silverware are very durable and a great price.
"Bought this set for my daughter because she didn't have much silverware. But, she loves it and it was a great price for the amount of pieces. It was a wonderful value."
Vale la pena comprarla
The spoons are really large. It‚Äôs like large and larger. They are easy to clean. Overall I think it‚Äôs a great deal for the amount of utensils you get
Very good quality & pretty.
This silverware is worth the price. It is very study for being on the low end of pricing. The only slight downfall is this silverware is big. I would buy this again for sure
Good for the price . Packaged well. Will use for a few years .
plain but very sturdy and reasonable
Loved the pieces & look
I do recommend this set
Value for the money
Definitely worth the money! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great price
Very sturdy
"I don‚Äôt know why know one else mentions it but these are the biggest silverware I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Bought for our RV. The big spoons are the size of my serving spoons in my house. I guess if you like big silverware, these would be great but I returned for something more normal sized."
This a great set for our camper. 10 servings is amazing. Only thing I would change is the size difference between the spoons. Both are fairly big
"They look a little cheap, but seem to be sturdy enough for every day use. My nice silverware set has slowly disappeared. Hence this cheaper set."
I brought this set because it had so many pieces of silverware for a great price. I should have looked at the measurements. The silverware does not fit in my drawer organizer and all of the spoons are way too large. The bigger forks are also too long. I will be returning to purchase smaller silverware.
I thought I was ordering the same ones as I‚Äôd bought before. These are much thinner and feel much cheaper than I was hoping.
"Look good, hold up in dishwasher just not sturdy at all."
"The strength of the silverware is great, very hard to bend, nice big spoons and forks. The problem though, is they are not all that comfortable to hold. Kind of too narrow towards the top which brings a weird imbalance to them that I didn't like. I do like the bigger spoons and forks for things link stirring when I am cooking and for dishing out sides. I'd say these are more like serving silverware then they are eating utensils. Don't get me wrong, I like them alot for the way you can like say.. scoop up a big serving of mashed potatoes and a nice scoop of a side pasta or something like that, but I guess I just prefer my usual set of silverware here at the house for eating with. No complaints about the butter knives though."
"We got this full silverware set to use since it seems we're always running out of the silverware we already have and our other silverware is a bit older also. Our kids have been using more silverware and losing it all over the place too so we decided to get another set of extra silverware to use. This is nice looking, handy, and useful to have around. They're pretty sturdy, decent, and nice quality knives, forks, and spoons. It has salad/dinner forks and soup/serving spoons and knives. They are pretty easy to clean and send through the dishwasher as well."
"I got these because we needed silverware for our RV. I love them! They are nicely weighted and feel good in the hand. This is a sign of a nice set of silverware. They don't feel cheap, no sharp edges left from molds. They are smooth, comfortable to hold, and stainless! They stay looking great without having to clean like silver. When the time comes I would replace my household silverware with this set. It's simple design is exactly what my minimalist self loves!"
"After decades of using the silverware my mother got me back when I was in college (and of course losing pieces over the years), it was definitely time for a new set.  This silverware set is very pretty. My daughter commented on how ‚Äúshiny‚Äù it is. But the individual pieces are huge. The large spoons, for example, are so big that they will not fit into the correct spot in my standard silverware tray. I can't see any of us eating with them, but they'll be great as serving spoons - seriously. The small spoons are so large that when I eat my cereal with them, it feels the same as eating with the large spoon from my original set. Similarly, we will only be using the small forks. And while we use the knives for spreading peanut butter and such, we wouldn't use them to eat with. Then again, we're vegetarian, so we're all about Forks Over Knives, anyway!"
"We are helping our granddaughter set up her new apartment and were happy to find 40 Piece Stainlesss Steel Silverware Set for 8, Mirror Finish Basic Flatware Cutlery Set on Amazon. These pieces have a nice weight to them and are attractive. They wash well but will show spots if you don't allow them to dry well in the machine or dry them by hand. These are shinier than other sets I have seen, but it gives them a modern look. I like that there are 8 of each....very functional."
I'm very satisfied with this silverware set. I was looking for a set with teaspoons and tablespoons and this set has a lot of each. They stay shiny after lots of washes in the dishwasher and I'm sure will last me a very long time.
"Definitely has a mirror finish and that is it for decoration. These are a very simple plain set which is fine by me. I love the smaller forks that come in the set, something I actually have never had so a nice addition. These would be great as a gift for a college student or a first apartment. If you are looking for fancy and embellished then these are not for you."
I bought these as a gift for a male friend who desperately needed flatware. He loved them! They are perfect for a man. Large and heavy.
"These are a nice weight, nicely made, and their smooth finish makes them a nice complement for any dinnerware. We got the polished version and they look great!"
"Simple set of flatware. I think it is a good price point, especially if you needed to buy several sets for a large gathering."
"We got these for a vacation home. They are actually pretty nice, nothing fancy and the price is right."
Great quality
I am fully satisfied with these spoons. The spoon has excellent quality and it looks sturdy as well. It is bigger in size (Perfect for lunch/dinner) and is dishwasher safe.  I highly recommend buying from this seller because if you buy from other sellers You will get fewer spoons at the same price and quality. Highly recommend it. Great purchase!!! Very happy
"Perfect size for eating soup, cereal & anything on a spoon. Exactly what I was looking for"
See above
Normal not so fancy table spoon gets the job done
These spoons are great quality
Great for cereal
I love the sturdiness of the spoons.
Nice
Que lo dejaron donde no es mi apartamento es B no en el jardin üò°
These were longer then all my other spoons. They are bad quality just not as good as I hoped. They are thin but could be a little rounder. I'm mostly pleased with this purchase.
Can‚Äôt believe the good material for this money
Muy buena son
ok for price...you get what you pay for...pretty cheap quality...no depth to spoon
"These sounds are big, like large soup spoons."
"Kind of thin but, nice big spoons for the price. Worth it if you don't want to spend a fortune on just regualr spoons. Weight is little light but nice."
"Good feel, smooth edges and right size."
Great buy
I love everything about this flatware set it is beautiful and elegant and affordable
The style was selected by my granddaughter and she absolutely loved the set. Looks beautiful with the other gold accessories for her table.
"Didn't realize how expensive a set for 4 of silverware was! I shopped around all over and even returned a set to Target bc I couldn't fathom spending 35 bucks on silver I only sort of liked. These ones have the slim handle look I was going for and are affordable. The quality is just as good, if not better, as sets you find at TJmaxx, Target, etc. Buy these!"
"As a re-useable alternative to plastic, then I think they‚Äôre ok. But for everyday use, they‚Äôre small. Like they feel too small to hold compared to the standard sets of utensils you‚Äôd find at a kitchen store for example. But the price reflects that. They look modern. But they are SO pointy! I wouldn‚Äôt have these around kids ever. So for something decorative and reuseable and inexpensive - these fit the bill."
I bought these for my sons first apartment.. he loved them. Thought they looked good better than the cheap sets you pick up at local stores
"I am so happy with these! They bring a new vibe to my dinnerware. Great quality, and beautiful. I chose gold and bought two sets. Must have!"
"Not only is it beautiful and modern to display on your table, it‚Äôs also functional"
"I loved it when I first bought it, but now after having them for four months, the color has nearly rubbed off all of them. They are pretty much now all silver. Don't buy.. Unless you purchase already in silver!"
Bought into the trend and theyre ok. They could be more sturdy.
For money they. Are worth it
"Great quality, compliments the table setting."
This set is beautiful. I have had it since last December and I love how it elevates my table setting. I handwash the pieces after each use. They still look as new. I would have given a rating of 5 but I find the edges of the spoons a little sharp.
The spoons are used to hold and they‚Äôre not light they get a little bit of weight in them
"Tienen una forma linda. Ojo! El cuchillo viene en un lado Sierra y en el otro es plano. No son cubiertos negro mate, es m√°s, me atrevo a decir que no son negros, son gris oscuro."
"Very low quality. I‚Äôve used these for a few weeks now, and the black is already coming off."
It‚Äôs very nice.
Dinero mal gastado..
"Way smaller than pictured and I feel like the dimensions aren‚Äôt correct. If your a tall family, this is not the way to go. Pretty though!"
Good for the price.
"I love them, just wish they were a little thicker"
This was a wedding gift that was sent to the couple and I didn't get to see it myself
"I'm pleasantly surprised by the heft of the flatware. I like the set a lot, really, but it is in no way matte black. For that, I have to subtract a star. I specifically wanted true matte. That being said it's not high gloss shine. More dull shine.  That might not be what I wanted, but it's not enough to make me leave a bad review.  I was concerned the thin handles would be easily bent and flimsy, but the set is pretty hefty given the thin style. It would take a concentrated effort to bend them. Everyday use is not going ruin them.  All in all they are a good set, don't feel too light or flimsy, but not heavy. Size is good, not too small. The color is nice, if only it were matte."
"I bought these to match my holiday plates. They are accented with black so these look great with them. They seem sturdy and can be machine washed like normal flatware. The spoons are slightly larger than my regular teaspoons, but I think I like it better this way. I really like the unique look of the skinny handles."
"Elegantes y muy lindos, espero mantengan su color con el tiempo"
"Exactly what i was looking for, The modern silverware look. Such a good find for the price"
"We've been using this set for about 3 month. Just good product, nothing to add. Highly recommended."
I ordered black and they were definitely more gunmetal like other reviews said but they are still fabulous. I‚Äôve used them a bit and have put them in my dishwasher after every use and they are holding up really well.
Me gustaron mucho
I bought the Silver wire for my daughters as a gift they love them
"Buen set de cubiertos, el color es tal cual la imagen, pero es complicado que despues de lavarlos no queden ""empanados"""
"I got 4 sets of these (service for 16 people) and we are not gentle them. They are holding up well. I don‚Äôt see any damage to them so far, I haven‚Äôt had trouble with water spots even though we don‚Äôt care for these any specific way. I have left acidic foods on them without issue. These are a very plain basic flatware design, but I really feel like they are sized and balanced well. The black adds a modern touch."
"I bought this set for my niece ( fam of 4), when I gave them to her son he like the color (black) to contrast with their white dishes, we like the feel on the fingers, sturdiness and light weight, the cleaning is easy by hand or dish washer; durability seems it‚Äôll surpass years. I‚Äôm glad my niece loves them and as aunt I love I gift her quality!"
So far they've been great. I don't run them thru the heat of a dishwasher and I think that will keep them in better condition. They are at a nice price! Try them! The kids are amazed also.
Durable stainless steel & beautiful finish on the color!
Absolutely loved them when we first got them. I searched for weeks for an affordable set. Unfortunately I had to return them after on wash in the dishwasher. Everything (especially the knifes) began to rust. It says they are dishwasher safe but that was not the case for us. I‚Äôd recommend that you hand wash them and see if you have better luck than we did.
"I absolutely love the way these look the only downfall is if you don‚Äôt dry them immediately after washing them, they get water spots on them."
Exactly as product is described. They are very sturdy and easy to hold. My kids love them.
Loved it and so did my daughter
Perfect
I bought them for myself.
The silverware have a nice smooth metallic finish that's perfect for eating. üòã
They start to rust and have spots on them after a lot of use
"These are very thin and not durable, retain ugly water spots. I would not recommend!"
Love the color an weight of it
"Not even close to black,they are like a shiny gray color.The pictures they show are not what you will get.I would give it a negative star rating if I could.Save your money or buy from a different company."
Love the silverware the grandkids love them too
"I got these yesterday and unpacked them. I was very pleasantly surprised at how insanely light they are! Even the large spoon, which tends to be the heaviest, was a nice light weight. They are comfortable to hold and are really pretty to boot. I got a gold set in a different shape/style and brand and while they are nice they are not dishwasher safe and it became too much of an annoyance to have to hand wash them every time someone used them. They were also really heavy, not uncomfortable per say, but not pleasant either. I am very pleased I decided to replace the other set for these ones as my daily use silverware, I have zero regrets! I bought two sets and am temped to buy two more so I can use them when I have large family gatherings so everyone has the same silverware (not the end of the world not to, but is visually pleasing to me). I highly recommend these."
"Lightweight and very very thin. Very disappointed, it differed a lot from description. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
Disappointed when received. Thin and looked cheap. Returned it.
"This flatware set arrived quickly and was nicer and high quality than I expected with lower price. The dinnerware feels very comfortable in hands, nice weight, thickness and beautiful, smooth finish. I definitely will order another set for guests or future replacements. It would be a great gift option as well. Five stars plus, this beautiful set is dishwashers safe. I feel great after using the dishwasher, and there is no taste at all, it is really great."
Ow wow! They are much better than I expected
Very pretty and heavy i will order more
"Not even close to black, They are like a shiny gray color. The pictures they show are not what you will get. I would give it a negative star rating if I could. Save your money or buy from a different company."
These stainless steel utensils are so pretty. It would make a nice gift. All edges on forks and spoons are smooth.
"Not super flimsy or super sturdy. Right in the middle. Great value ,color is very pretty. I will buy another set next pay check. Spoon handles are more green... yet I don‚Äôt hate it ."
The only concern I would express is the thickness of the neck but aside from that they are great set.
I ordered in black because it‚Äôs a great neutral colour and it‚Äôs able to match a lot of my stuff
"i love the quality of them, but they sent me 4 sets of forks and one set of knives, but no spoons. very upset for this was my first ever utensil set since i moved out"
"I MOVED AND LEFT MY SILVERWARE. I WAS LOOKING FOR TOP NAME BRAND. COULDN'T AFFORD IT AND FOUND THESE ON AMAZON. THE PICTURE LOOKED LIKE ""FINE WARE"" SO I OREDERED ONE SET AND AM VERY PLEASED. I LOVE MY NEW/USED SILVERWARE. NOT TOO LIGHT OR TOO HEAVY. HAS HIGH GLOSS FINISH THAT MAKES AN ELEGANT LOOK. GREAT PRICE FOR THE ITEM!"
"Very please w this purchase for the price. Yes it has the brand on the BACK of the silverware like all silverware, but you can‚Äôt beat the price, pleasantly surprised and wouldn‚Äôt let some of the reviews sway you from buying this if you are looking for functionality and sturdy utensils . Thanks!"
"I absolutely loved my silverware,it's very durable and easy to clean. I'm so amazed my the quality at such a great deal. I'm definitely going to be buying more & recommending it to others"
"The silverware looks great. It has large and small spoons, salad and dinner forks. They are sturdy and a great value for the money."
Totally happy with the set. The edges not sharp (except for the knives) and right size.
"I waited to write this so I could get some wear on the set and since it's been a few months of use I've seen zero rust, jagged edges, or bending. They are stronger than some more expensive utensils. I'm pleased with this purchase."
These are sturdy utensils in a classic design which goes well with any dishware. Great value for $.
"I do believe the dish ran away with my spoons, hence the need to by some replacements for my everyday silverware. These are great . . . nice chrome finish and heavy-duty. No problems in the dishwasher, except for some water spots. Cannot beat the price and the quality, so bought another set for my RV. Definitely recommend."
My favorite thing is I can comfortably hold and use them. I have 2 other sets that cost lots more but these are stylish and a good weight utensils at a very nice price. I liked these well enough to buy a second set for a service for 8. It makes me feel good having a complete silverware set and toss all of my mismatched junkware.
Was skeptical because of the price but reviews were right - these are plain but sturdy - the weight is just right and they fit in with our mishmash of flatware - Pleasantly surprised and will be ordering another set before the holidays
"Brought this for my son for his new apartment. This is a great everyday set to use. Looks like you paid more for it. My son really liked it. The order came in before original date which I was happy about it, and the price was perfect. Definitely worth purchasing."
"Bought these when a similar priced set from Walmart started to show rust spots. I was genuinely impressed when i took these out of the box! Theyre a good strudy weight, and havent shown any cosmetic damages yet. We are really happy with them. Ours have the logo on the underside of the handles, not the topside, which we prefer. I didnt actually notice the logo until a few days in!"
Nice practical set . Knives have a serrated edge so will do well cutting meat. Got these for RV.
"Just moved out of a relationship after 10 years & needed to buy everything , including cutlery. this set did the job for me & they came with average but good steak knives. Win win."
I was happy to receive this set at the price that they were offered. I got these on prime for $15 delivered. You can beat it. They said not cheap looking.
"No complaints, they are basic but still nice enough that I am not concerned with replacing anytime soon at all."
"Great silverware set for the PRICE!!! Mom of 3 boys! Holding up fine in a household where all we do is eat! Dishwasher safe...no rusting. Heavy enough where it make me ""feel"" Iike i have brought a $50 set of silverware. Will definitely be ordering another set!!"
‚Ä¢ light weight than normal ‚Ä¢ perfect set for 4 ‚Ä¢ sizes are proportional ‚Ä¢ easy to clean - plug to dishwasher & let it play üòÅ
"Got this for mom, she‚Äôs totally loves! Very easy to clean and great for everyday casual use! Will probably be ordering again. Love these utensils üôÇ"
"I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting much for the price, but these are great quality silverware and perfect for moving out and living on your own for the first time! No sharp edges!"
Very pleasantly surprised at this set. The feel and look of each piece would make you think it was much more expensive. Very happy with my choice of silverware!
Great price and they look nice. I will probably get more.
"They are very strong and heavy , not cheap at all. Great buy"
The set met my expectations and arrived fast from the Seller just in time to impress a client who came over for dinner.
Nice set of silverware well worth the money!
Bought as a gift for a wedding registry
They are perfect fur our camper
I bought the set for a family member who was just getting first apartment.
Wow this set superseded my expectations and then some! I wasn‚Äôt expecting this quality at this price boy-oh-boy was I wrong! Highly recommended even if your not on a budget!
There not as cheap looking as I thought they would be I love them
The durability of the flatware is good
Very nice high quality product that let's me feel like I got a great purchase for the amount I spent I would buy again but the item is durable and im sure they'll last me a long time
"These are great! The large forks and spoons are VERY large, which I love because I use them as serving utensils. I love the heavier weight and don't mind the logo on the back."
Well made easy to clean
Love that this set includes steak knives. Clever idea. Great price. üëçüëç
These are higher quality than most resraruants. I replaced the platic in my RV. Perfect!
Great value for the price!
"Bought these for our camper and we love them. Very sturdy, not cheaply made and are working out well. Would purchase again."
"I needed a set of silverware for me, and these are great. The large spoon has an awkwardly long handle, but other than that, they are great."
Good weight and very easy to use.
"Love this silverware set! So easy to clean and it looks really nice with any table setting. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants something that not only looks nice, but will last for a long time. Great price too!!"
I like the simplistic style of the flatware.
Like this. Larger than many. Sturdy but not overly heavy. Wash nicely. I'm pleased. Good p/v.
Strong and easy to clean.
The cutlery is fit for daily use and has simple but attractive finishes. Highly recommended for all meal settings.
Im pleased with the quality of these utensils! They are very shiny after washing and not dull like most silverware
Great quality and perfect for housewarming gift!
Not as heavy and thick as I would have hoped but we like them ok
"Love this silverware, the shine stays perfect and they wash easlily"
what I expected
Not much to say because this set is great and very inexpensive.
"These utensils are smooth. The small spoon is larger than I am accustomed, but it's fine."
Husband order for me the silverware is easy to take care of nice weight.
Just a nice casual st of flatware for our RV. perfect for our trips
This is a very nice silverware set for the price. Very sturdy and heavier than expected. I definitely recommend it.
Can‚Äôt beat this 20 pirate set for the price
Very nice!
Good shape l easy to hold and clean
"I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase. Product came exactly as in the photos, very good quality (already used in dishwasher and came out fine) and nice simple design. Highly recommend."
The flatware was much better than I expected
Nice every day set for the price. Starter set for my young adult daughters first home.
Because for sturdiness and easy to clean
They are sturdy and serve their purpose well. I actually enjoy using my new silverware. It looks and feels like good quality.
"Great purchase, for a great price."
More than I expected from a low cost product.. purchased for my camper and good enough to use at home.
Shipped quickly and were as advertised
This was a gift. They said they are very happy with the product.
Purchased for college apartment. A great addition to my sons kitchen!
They feel heavy enough and look very nice.
"I didn't expect for the quality to be so Nice, I'm totally pleased with them"
"The steak knives serrated edge is super sharp, very modern looking silverware, easy to clean, use dish to keep the silvery shine"
This silverware set is great! My children love the color and they can easily hold them with their little hands. They are durable and look really nice
I loved how nice the actual silverware is. The box was a little (not horrible) damaged. I washed them right away and no rust or even water marks on them. Very happy overall!
These are sturdy and look really good. Definitely great value. I really like them.
Love the small forks.
"Perfect set, dishwasher safe, not matte but not super shiny either. Love this set"
Beautiful. Adds a uniqueness to the blank and grey kitchen theme
"This set is hands down the best silverware I have ever had for every day use. Simple, elegant and beautiful but sturdy enought for every day use"
I like the plain smooth shiny eatery
Like the long handles
Needed a new cutlery set.
"I washed them as soon as I received them so that I could use right away. The knives were first to rust and then the smaller forks. Its just a matter of time before they are rust. They are pretty to look at, but not for everyday use."
Nice
They are great
I bought this as a shower gift. I have to give this to the bride today for her shower gift. I'm embarrassed and expecting to take it home with me so I can return it. The metal is so cheap and flimsy it will bend if I drop it on the ground. Don't waste your money on this.
se manchan muy facil
The product is as described.
Absolutely beautiful and a special add to any table setting
Very nice and sturdy set of silverware.
"I was so impressed with the quality of this set and I'm no easy sell. I am a retired engineer and take a lot of time gauging the products I buy. This set is a perfect design allowing easy cleaning, robust performance (will not bend or twist and feels just right in material thickness and polishing). Lastly, compared to other sets the value is the best by far. This set will look great 20 years from now!"
The silverware is very sturdy and feels heavier than my previous silverware. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good value and quality silverware!
"I love silverware that has a good feel to it; particularly with regards to mass. This silverware fits the bill. It is very sleek with the knives actually being slightly serrated so they can do some light cutting. The small forks are fairly dainty as well. While this isn't intended to be a luxury set by any means, for the same price it looks and feels like much higher quality than what one might find from one of those mass department stores. Recommended."
Bought 2 sets of these one with the hostess set and one of the regular ones.. I can say they are made really well and look good also. I am just trusting there is no nickel in them and so far my fingers are good. Great product if you have a nickel allergy or just want to eat off of something that is not toxic..
"The packaging makes this set seem like it would not be of good quality. It's is not very appealing. So I first thought I might return the silver ware. Once I opened the product and took the pieces out of the plastic wrapping, it wasn't beautiful and nice. Good quality and shiny. Washes easily too. I am very satisfies with this product and the quality and value."
Look what happens after two weeks
"I ordered these over two years ago because I was down to 10 forks from two different 12 piece place setting sets. How 14 forks go missing over 15 years, I still haven't figured out! Hoping that empty-nesting will help with that now! Anyway, after shopping for a set for awhile, I knew I didn't want the apparently new trend of super-sized silverware. Everything I looked at had long handles, and I despise those when I use them in restaraunts. These are smaller - not as small as my prior sets, but not super long either. These are very nice, weight-wise, very sturdy and are still nice and shiny (like new) after over two years of daily use and running through the dishwasher.  We use the knives that came with this Raindrop pattern set as steak knives. The tapered blade on these knives are not very proficient at butter and mayo spreading, so I did purchase a separate set of knives only, from another company that has more of a butter spreading blade that matches this set pretty closely.  Would I buy these again? Absolutely! I fact, I ordered a second set of 12 place settings so I won't run out, just in case the silverware thieves continue to show up at my house!"
"I am thrilled with this purchase. For the price of the set, I expected much lower quality. Is it the same as buying a $200 set of silverware? No. But I am amazing at the quality for the price. These are what I would call medium to heavyweight. I use them every day and run them through the dishwasher. I've had them for 5 months and they look like they are brand new. There is not a single scratch and I am NOT gentle. I've scooped ice cream with the spoons and they hold their shape. If you are on the fence about buying these, just buy them."
"I've only had these for about four months, but I am ordering more, so I figured, I might as well write a review. The utensils have a sleek look and nice weight to them, which adds to the quality factor. I've hand washed them with a nylon brush, detergent and bit of bleach, several times, and they came out great. I usually place them in the dishwasher on heavy wash, and I've seen no sign of premature aging or damage. They look just as good as they did when I first purchased them. When it comes to utility, the dinner forks are small enough for a child to use safely, but it's still adult size. The salad forks are long with prongs spread perfectly for a good spearing. The spoons are great for tea or soups. I've used the knives to cut through steak and it gave me no problems."
"This is a quality silverware set! I had to laugh at the one reviewer who complained about the serated knives cutting them. The description says the knives are serated! If you can't figure that out, then you deserved to get cut when you opened it. Any fool could see when opening them that the knives are sharp and serated. The silverware is all exactly the size one would expect and high quality. Perfect for daily or special event use! I'm very pleased with this purchase!"
I can only rape this product looks and feel because it was a gift for someone. They look beautiful and they feel very good. The knife is not Hollow and has a nice weight to it and somewhat of a serrated edge. If they hold up as beautifully as they look then it's a bargain
"We've been using these for about three months now, so I can safely say they're good quality! We run them through the dishwasher and they don't rust, use them to scoop ice cream and they don't bend. They feel good in the hand and are shiny and beautiful. Like other reviewers said, the table knives are very sharp. But I took their warnings and haven't cut myself yet! I actually really like how sharp the table knives are because I can use them to cut open packages and things. There is literally nothing I dislike about this silverware."
I‚Äôm seriously so impressed with this set!! I was looking for something that wasn‚Äôt too expensive to replace all the silverware my kids have somehow ‚Äúlost‚Äù and these are perfect! They are heavy and durable- again so impressed :)
"The silverware I ordered I just love. Not too heavy, looks better in person and I love they are so sleek. I want to get a couple more sets. I love that its plain without a design so will go with anything but the end although plain it still has this rich flare. I would recommend them to anyone."
For the price you cant beat these. My kids love to throw their silverware in the trash for some reason and these are very good and cheap to replace.
"I was in desperate need of new silverware. The sets that I had were old and terribly scratched. I found this set and liked that there was the option to order in a larger set. I typically feed at least 5+ people on a daily basis and need to make sure I have enough silverware for us all. I was very impressed with the quality of this silverware due to the price. I was not at all expecting it to be made so well. It is much more heavy duty than the sets I have previously owned. We have not had any bending, scratching, etc. I love these so much that I am going to be purchasing a second set."
"This silverware set is ok. Good for it‚Äôs price. If you are looking for something more sturdy and not cheap looking do not buy this. I purchased this set because I kept missing spoons. So I figured if my spoons keep disappearing, at least I know I did not purchase an expensive set of silverware"
I loved this set. I would diffently buy this again. It was nice and heavy so you can tell it is a well made silverware.
My family and I absolutely love this silverware I couldn't be more happier with the purchase will definitely order more I definitely recommend
"Great value for the money, no problems so far! They are just what I was looking for!"
My husband purchased this set because our little boy apparently likes to throw his silverware in the trash when he's cleaning up his dinner plate. I had purchased a Oneida set for $70 which was what he was throwing away. These are surprisingly just as good of quality as the $70 set. I'm sure when he starts sneaking and throwing his forks and spoons in the trash again that I'll be purchasing this set again.
"High quality, stylish, and affordable silverware set. Clean well in dishwasher and by hand, and do not dry with spots on them like some silverware finishes. Very happy with these utensils and the quality for the price. Definitely recommend!"
"I ordered the service for 8, or the 40 piece set. I am delighted with the quality. There are no rough edges on the spoon bowls, and the flatware is very shiny. They feel good in the hand, with nice heft. Since the pattern is so plain, they will go nicely with my patterned serving pieces. Now if I could just get more dinner spoons and teaspoons, I would be very happy!"
"Its a nice set of tableware. I had a bunch of random tableware that i had from college/ roommate days. I ditched those, and got this set. They look good and are nice and sturdy. Overall its a great upgrade!"
Bought one set and had to buy another after seeing and opening the 1st set :D. Standard silverware. Nothing fancy but nice and sleek. Doesn't have the cheap feel to it
"I was looking for a nice seamless design and something that wouldn't bend easily. These do the trick. The knives are great for cutting, they are mildly serrated on one side. There are two fork and spoon sizes, the smaller size is perfect for kids."
This item came well packaged to prevent damage during shipping. The flatware is a nice weight and they wash beautifully. The table knives actually have a bit of an edge to them so they should definitely be washed carefully.
Love these. So many reviews with so many opinions. But I guess that's the point. But these are really perfect and haven't had any issues after almost 2months of use.
"I got these because we had company coming and needed silverware fast. We live in the middle of no where so going to the store is not an option. I love how sturdy they are and how easy they are to clean. The have gone in the dishwasher multiple times and still look great! I was afraid they might be ""cheap"" quality because of the price but they are way better quality than my previous set that was twice the price. Not one complaint from me!"
This silverware is nice. They have some weight to them. The butter knives can cut an apple they are sharp. They wash up nicely. I have had them for a year now and no rust or scratches.
Love this set! These are very easy to clean and I don‚Äôt get any spots or rust because I don‚Äôt use a dishwasher. Proper care and they will stay shiny and last a looooong time! :)
"one word of caution... watch the butter knife it's as sharpas a steak knife. I was going to buy Oneida but these were a quarter of the price, time will tell"
Ordered bc I didn‚Äôt want little crevices that are in patterned silverware. This set is shiny and beautiful and sturdy. I would recommend!
"They are very sturdy, very fancy."
I like this set of silverware because it is very sturdy.
"Up to this point I have always had cheap utensils with plastic handles. Hubby and I just bought a new home and decided we would upgrade to ""grown-up"" utensils. These are very classy looking and feel comfy in your hands. I like them."
I‚Äôve been searching for a silverware set for a while now and this is by far the best for the price! You get so many pieces and they all hold up on the dishwasher.
This silverware was better than I had hoped. Beautiful and well designed.
"Sturdy quality, heavy duty enough for daily use."
I ordered this as a gift. Nice sturdy pieces. They wash beautifully in the dishwasher. Very pleased with this purchase.
I love the clean classy look. The butter knives are VERY sharp though so be careful! You wouldn't expect to get cut by a butter knife but I have been cut several times while washing them.
Absolutely love this silverware! I love that it has your normal size dinner fork and a smaller dessert fork. This was so hard to find! I hate the large salad forks. Will definitely be buying more of!
I love this set because its a great quality but not that heavy. I don't like really big Forks or spoons. I feel like it's just right. Now my husband lives a big heavy fork but he compromised with me on this set. So I bought 2 sets
Good quality for the price. Nice weighty feel and extra bright. Machine washes well. Have used for formal dinner and received compliments.
I purchased this set for our office kitchen. The silverware is used and washed frequently and is holding up well.
Nice Silverware. I Love the Mirror Finish. Rounded edges mostly which is nice. All except the very bottom of the pieces. No big deal. Looking to buy more teaspoons that match but their not out yet. Overall a upgrade to what I had before so I'm very happy.
I wanted something inexpensive. This does the trick. It is pretty lightweight but looks nice and fit the budget.
I like everything about this set. Simple lines and nice and bright.
"LOVE this set. It‚Äôs super sexy and sleek and can easily transition between formal or informal dining. Quality silverware and LOVED the pricing, it was a great value!"
This is a very nice and sturdy set of silverware that will last a long time. Sleek design. Would definite recommend these to anyone.
It's as simple as that! They're beautiful. Sturdy. Feel good in the hands while using them. Overall excellent quality.
The design and also the weight are much to my liking. Sophisticated.
"Sturdy silverware. We feel like we are not eating with cheap, puny silverware and it looks presentable."
Knives are sharper than you think lol. Cut myself opening them. But this product is great. Love them. Wish this pack cane with a longer set of tea spoons and some soup spoons tho!
This set was the cheapest I could find but I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. I have all white dishes so these utensil go great with them.
Loved the design and the mirrored polished finish gives it a clean and classy look. Knives are pretty sharp too and easy to clean. I highly recommend them.
"Have had these for a few months and still look new!! I have even left in the sink in water for over a week and no rust, as some reviews have said.. a very good purchase!!"
These are exactly as described and very nice
This silverware set is beautiful yet simple. I love it! Have had it for about 9 months now and it still looks great!
"nice set with plenty of peices for a family of 5. had them about 3months now, dishwasher cleaned daily and havnt had any signs of rust."
"Great deal for silverware, I have put them in the dishwasher to clean and no problems yet...they look good my only complaint is that the small forks and spoons are TINY..."
Really nice affordable silverware. It washed well in the dishwasher and not clouding like others have. They stay shiny. Have a good weight to them too.
These are sturdy and larger than our last set. They are super shiny and I love them. The butter knife is sharper than most but my boyfriend loves them.
These are beautiful and serve their purpose. They‚Äôre so shiny even after using and washing multiple times. They‚Äôre sturdy and easy to clean. 10/10 would recommend especially for the price.
Very beautiful product! I‚Äôve paid three times as much for similar quality elsewhere. Highly recommend!
This is a sturdy set of flatware. It has a high shine and the littles have not been able to destroy them. Better quality than the cheaper stuff you can buy at the store and arrived quickly. Would purchase again.
So far- so good! I've only had the set for a couple weeks but I love it. Definitely worth every penny. I love how sturdy it is... and I'm super picky to say the least üòä
"Stylish and sturdy, comfortable in hand."
Great value for the price. Goes with any type of dinnerware.
Good quality for the money sturdy and heavy
"This set saved me alot of money , I would have easily had to spend over $60 to buy everything individually , they are stiff and sturdy the knives are sharp! Worth every penny"
"This was way better than I thought! I had been buying 4 for a dollar silverware for so long (having kids means spoons and forks disappear constantly, so makes sense to spend as little as possible on them) I had forgotten how nice it was to have solid eatery at home!  I'd definitely recommend this set to anyone looking for a nice set that isn't costly."
"The forks are really big, which I thought was strange. So ate the tablespoons, they are more like serving spoons. But other than that, they are great and heavy stainless steel. Love them. I bought for the camp. Good buy!"
"Bought for my daughter, for her move to her apartment. Nice set going to have to now but for myself!"
I love this set because it has so many pieces. They are durable and wash up nicely
I never have enough flatware for my family! Now I have enough for all of them!
One the best sets I have ever gotten
I liked the price. The quality is good too. With a house full of kids it always seems like silverware is going missing these were very practical for that situation.
This was a gift that my friend loved. I wasn‚Äôt sure how light weight it would be but it was pretty hefty. It was a much better quality than I thought it would be.
Excelent
"I wasn't expecting anything remarkable at this price point, however this is NOT something that should be in your kitchen drawer unless you're a college student. This does not carry any maker's stamp, impossible to even begin to guess the metal they are made out of, or where they were manufactured, and the finish on the steak knives make them unusable (literally). The blade butt (the tang) protrudes above/below/all-around the handle making it sharp and uncomfortable among the very many other ills of this set. I do not recommend this, and I am returning it as defective!"
I'm a little disappointed in the silverware. Half of my forks were already bent when I took them out of the packaging. I doubt they'll hold up for long. I hate bent forks!! I guess for $27.99 I shouldn't have expected much.
This was a gift...So I can only assume she is satisfied with the set. I haven't heard any complaints as far.
Good quality for the price. Teaspoons are larger than normal‚Ä¶steak knives are great!
"Honestly, I like the silverware but I struggle with the review because of the presentation. I purchased this as a gift but when my package got to me, it was very disturbing because the box was torn opened and the silverwares were falling out. Fortunately, all the silverwares were still there. I don‚Äôt think that I will purchase this product again!"
"The edges will cut your mouth. You get what you pay for, but with that being said the price for this set should only be $20 -$25."
The back of a knife cut through my finger when pressure was applied. Should that happen? I don‚Äôt think so. Rest of everything is good. Just keep fingers off the top of the metallic part of the knife when applying force. And better not cook a hard steak.
"The big spoons are huge and are more like serving spoons than the regular big spoons. I don't generally use the small spoons we have since when I eat cereal, soup etc., I want a larger portion, but these new ""big"" spoons we got are way too big!!!"
I love this set but if they are left in the dishwasher they get rust spots quickly
It reminds me of school cafeteria silverware. I gave three stars because at least they were very affordable.
The set looked serviceable and was in new condition. I returned the item because the ends of the handles had a sharp edge that was not rounded over after being stamped.
"I've had these for a month and a half and I've already tossed all of the butter knives, and about half of my big spoons. They get rusted after dishwashing."
Cuando los lavas se quedan manchados con el agua y parece que estuvieran sucios.
Do not buy! Rusted after 10 washes!
Dollar store quality. Really thin & lightweight.
They rust after 3 uses. DO NOT BUY
Worst set ever!! washed the silverware in the dishwasher and they came out with rust! The steak knives suck too!! Pics are from 1 wash‚Ä¶
In the photos they look more beautiful. And smaller ones.
I worried a little about how sturdy this would be but for the price it was really good. I'd buy it again.
Gave this set to my daughter for her birthday the other day and she loves the set.she could not believe it came with steak knives to which she really needed.So happy she liked them.would definitely buy again for a gift or for myself Terry
"For some reason I only had 5 spoons and forks, with 50 butter knifes....not sure what the kids do with my utensils. But these are worth the value."
Great quality silverware
What I like about it yu could hold them and they are wonderful
I love it
Nice set and worth the money.
Very good quality for the price.
Love them
"Waited awhile to write this review. I wanted to put them to the test. All I can say is that I adore them. Very sturdy and a wonderful rainbow color. The soup spoons are nice and large, I am a Chef of 40 years and I can use the soup spoons also for basting when I am sauteing. No color fading, come out great from the dishwasher, very durable and once again a lovely color. They stand out nicely when I host a dinner party. I always get a compliment on my dinner ware, and also get asked where I got them. I liked the dinner ware so much I am now a proud owner of the spaghetti spoon, the spatula and the steak knives. I recommend these highly if you want to add a bit of color to your table."
"I ordered 3 sets of silverware. I'm not sure what happens but promise I think the dishwasher eats silverware. :) Honestly, we eat out a lot so think we inadvertently through it away. Our silverware draw was thin so ordered 3 sets. FYI - we are not picky about our silverware like some are so took a chance and ordered three different sets. 1 set - multi colored - rainbow cutlery silverware. Purchase price: $23.99 - MY FAVORITE of the 3. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYQ1XYT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 The multicolored - THIS REVIEW - Nice set - seems durable and is beautiful.  1 set - Fiesta Siverware - MY HUSBAND's FAVORITE - Price $27.99 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GY790C2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Nice handle - seems substantial - and even has a signature somewhere on the spoon which I think is impressive. :) I have not had the problem with the tarnishing that is left in other reviews and we have had this one before.  1 set: RENOOK MAtte Black Silverware - Price $29.97 but had 5 sets instead of 4. Last on the list. :) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089LXQSYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Smaller than the others. Not truly black but a dark metal - they are okay - but are the least favorite of the 3.  BOXING (not important to me but may be others) The boxing of the black set was nice. It came in a pink box that I probably would have recycled to wrap a gift in had it not had the brand of the silverware on the front. :) The next set was the fiesta - and it came in a box that you would find in a department store showing the silverware in the front. It was the hardest to get out since it had the ties on one set. The last was the multicolored set. It came in a small standard box. Nothing fancy but was the easiest for me to open. This is probably not the one that you would want to give as a gift since it truly wasn't anything special. :)  Overall my review: Tie: Multicolored and Fiesta for different reasons Third place: The black (would not order again)  At the end of the day, these will be long gone in 6 months and we will be ordering again but do hope this review helps someone. :)"
"I've been searching for a good quality flatware set with this multicolor finish. I've actually purchased a few single place settings, to try out, but none were right. They were not balanced or too large, or too small, or the surface felt rough. FINALLY! I've found the right one! I ordered the set of 4 place settings, to try out. The price was great and I figured I could use them for camping if they weren't good. I got them yesterday, and they are PERFECT! They went through the dishwasher just fine. The shape and style is understated, but elegant enough to use for holidays. The finish is flawless.  Most important - the size of these utensils is just right - like a regular American brand - and perfectly balanced in your hand. I will be ordering two more, to complete my set. Kudos to the manufacturer for getting this design exactly right."
"I love this cutlery set! It's so fun to see in my drawer, have at my table, eat with, and wash. It reminds me of blowing bubbles and makes me smile. I found each piece in working order (no sharp points), have washed them a few times since buying them, and have no tarnishing or scratches. The weight is good and sturdy. I believe they'll last a long time. The small spoon in the set is a little larger than the usual size but is easy to get used to. Also, I bought soup spoons, ice tea, and dessert spoons to have on hand. It would be amazing to have pans like this as well. I'm happy with them and would recommend this seller/set to anyone wanting to add some fun to their dishes."
"WOW! I was a little worried at first but once these arrived - I was pleasantly surprised! Great, quality product at a reasonable price! These are such a perfect touch to my dinner parties and the photo doesn‚Äôt do justice to the colors! You won‚Äôt regret this purchase !!!"
""
"When these first arrived, I was blown away by how pretty they were. Solid, smooth, permanent rainbow finish, easy to clean, nice to hold.  After using them for a while, realized that I avoided using the big spoons because they don‚Äôt fit easily in my mouth, so switched them over to being serving spoons and got long handled small scoop spoons in rainbow and they look like they belong with the rest of the set. Also sprang for some rainbow steak knives, which matches perfectly, too.  Got 2 sets of these, because I regularly have to serve 8 and they‚Äôre so pretty that my old flatware looks pathetic next to them and I didn‚Äôt want people to fight over the nice ones.  Everyone who sees them for the first time is visibly impressed. Never thought that people would be impressed by cutlery, but here we are."
"I bought these as a replacement for an Expensive well known brand of product, which didn't last even a year. So far, I just love these! So pretty with the oil slick style of color. I hand wash them as I don't have a dishwasher and no scratches. The only negative thing I can think of is the large spoons are LARGE. But not to large to be fine functionally. Very glad I bought 2 sets. for a service of 8. :)"
"Let me start off by saving that the silverware is so beautiful. The picture does not do them justice. I was so excited when I opened the package, and even more excited after I washed and dried them. My daughter made fun of me because I was acting like a kid in a candy shop. I can see why the ratings on this item is so good. I plan on purchasing another set in the future. A few pieces were scuffed and paint peeled, but the seller was very helpful. Overall my experience with this product is 10/10."
"This set of flatware üç¥ is beautiful as well as sturdy and I love the larger spoons ü•Ñ which are heavier than our previous spoons.  They‚Äôre so pretty I was afraid to use them after washing but they remain just as beautiful as when I bought them. My husband and mother-in-law think they‚Äôre great as well! I thought my husband might not like them because of all the colors but his words were, ‚ÄúWow! Those look cool!‚Äù I agree!  Dishwasher safe and everything. Very sturdy!"
"This silverware is just as pretty as it looks online! It‚Äôs definitely as advertised! I ran the entire set through the dishwasher before use; it survived the bath with no problem! The silverware is a nice weight; it‚Äôs actually heavier than I expected, but that‚Äôs a good thing! This set is an excellent value for the money! I liked it so much that I ordered the matching rainbow stainless steel ramen bowl set, and cork screw. I currently have the 5 qt. pot, salt n pepper shakers, napkin holder, and kitchen utensil set in my cart!"
"spoon bowls in set were larger than expected. Handles flat-ish with ""pressed"" feel but fit better in my drawer and eel good in your hand. Nice weight to them. Got 3 sets; all pieces there. All looked good. Immediately put into dishwasher with high heat dry - came out great. No color changes, no scratches,Tines on forks are sharp, will actually stick into food! Knives also have serration like in picture. Good colors - think these will be fun!"
"I was looking for some new silverware on Amazon Prime and I came across these cute as heck spoons, forks, and knifes and just had to have them ,especially after I read all the great reviews I had read. I ordered these and got them the very next day! After opening them up and looking at them in person I washed them and ordered another set right away, them game the next day!!! I threw out all of my old silverware and now use only these Beautiful Colorful Gem's!!!"
I like that the colors are truly rainbow some other brands don‚Äôt have consistent colors like this one. The weight of the silverware is nice so they don‚Äôt feel cheap. They come in a cute box and are individually wrapped. They are a little longer than regular silverware. I plan on using them on my dining table for special occasions there are so pretty. I‚Äôm soooo happy I found these on Amazon cause I wanted a set of rainbow silverware for quite some time but I couldn‚Äôt ever find any. I think the price is a good value for the money. I love rainbow color items!
"I've had this set for about two months now. The first thing I noticed is how heavy / sturdy they feel. The definitely do not feel cheap. It's a nice weight, not overly heavy. Also, I was worried about the finish coming off in the dishwasher, but after many, many washes, this set looks as good as the first day they came. Definitely will buy these again."
"My daughter and I have wanted a set like this for awhile now. Unfortunately it was a little too pricey and many also come In much bigger sets. When I saw this for $20 and just 4 sets, I knew it was perfect for the two of us! I handwash my dishes and air dry them on a dish rack. We have had no problems at all and we love this rainbow flatware."
I ordered this exact set 4 yrs ago and they still look brand new. They have been thru the dish washer 100‚Äôs of times and they‚Äôre still as shiny and pretty as the day I got them. You can‚Äôt go wrong and you won‚Äôt be sorry.

"Nice, colorful flatware. Two improvements I‚Äôd make: more heft to individual pieces for people with tremors, and add soup spoons to the set. Otherwise I like them. These pieces are slightly, but only slightly, heavier than pieces I recently discarded for not being weighty enough. These do make for a festive table, though."
"This product is great. I bought 2, one for myself and one for a friend. We are both very pleased. Previously bought a similar set but within 6 months the ‚Äúfinish‚Äù began to peel off and that was with hand washing. This brand has been fantastic! My friend has run it through the dishwasher and no problem at all. I have four children that are rough on silverware and it‚Äôs stood up to everything they‚Äôve thrown at it. I highly recommend this product! Definite thumbs up!"
"I am in love with this Rainbow Flatware. I had been searching for several months for just the right flatware to include in a gift to my Hawaiian Cousins. This was just the perfect answer and I couldn't be more pleased. The colors are vibrant and the weight of the flatware balances nicely in your hand. It is an especially nice set since it includes a salad fork and a soup spoon. I will be ordering for myself now that I have seen the beauty. When I present my gift, I should play ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" by IZ. Love!"
"I originally ordered one pack, as soon as I opened them I put in an order for two more! They are solid! Great quality! I also ordered the steak knives and the set with the spatulas, tongs, and other kitchen utensils. All such great quality! You won‚Äôt regret purchasing them!!"
What do you call these? Cutlery? Silverware? Flatware? Foodscoopies? Eating irons? Food Canoues? Prideware? Gamer shovels?
"This flatware is much better than I expected. I was worried the rainbow finish would be a cheap coating, but it appears to be a heat treated plating. Ran it through the dishwasher and had silverware clanking around in the sink with no damage. The metal is thick and has weight to it, but not too much. Nicely rounded and polished. Simple, except for the rainbow oil slick coating. Marked ""stainless steel"". These aren't bad, especially for the price."
"I absolutely love this set! I love the vibrant colors, and the set seems to be sturdy; however, I WON‚ÄôT use these in the dishwasher, because I‚Äôm not sure if it will cause damage, and I certainly want them to last! Better safe than sorry. ;)"
If you like fun matching items this is for you i like fun things and if you have colorful cheerful items your kids love it they want to use that fun colorful silverwear to eat i have the set cups utensils salt and pepper my grandkids love it
My boyfriend and I have been using these since the day they were delivered in August 2021. We do not own a dishwasher but I can tell you that they have sat soaking in the sink sometimes for a couple days when we've been lazy. They are still just as vibrant and colorful since they day we got them !!!! Super happy with my purchase !!!
When i got the products I hand washed them in soapy water. They still looked like the rainbows you see on the concrete at the playground. I got them for my mom but when I saw them I kept them and ordered her some more. They're perfect if you want to add a little color to your kitchen.
"I have had this set of cutlery for about a month now because I didn't want to write my review before we used them a bit. These are not just gorgeous but they are really durable and wash well. They have been through countless dishwasher cycles on high heat and are holding up great! I love that I can open my silverware drawer to a rainbow and it make them so much easier to find when my 14 year old son eats in his room. These are great! Buy them, you will not be sorry."
Absolutely beautiful. Love these and so do my kids. They love eating with the pretty rainbow silverware. And I love that the big spoons are BIG and the big forks have an extra long handle. They feel solid and durable. Will edit review if they don't hold up.
"I looked at these and then read the reviews. I loved, loved, loved the color and took the leap. They are so bold and beautiful. The weight on them is great. Its nothing like having silverware with that good weight. The kind at hotels that you wish you had at home. They are durable and sturdy. I have already cleaned them...so easy. Purple is my favorite color, pink is my daughters, and blue is my husband and son. So this is great for the entire family. Maybe this will help my daughter remember not to put the silverware in the trash. Lol. ü•∞ Great purchase."
"Just looking at this set is amazing, much less the sleek design and light bright colorful approach to setting a table ir just picking up a spoon- or fork! Eating something with one of these utensils is a happy adventure!"
"I LOVE this cutlery SO MUCH! They are strong and sturdy and perfect sizes. Amazing quality and so beautiful to look at too! 1 box is 20 pieces: 4 small spoons, 4 big spoons, 4 small forks, 4 big forks and 4 knives. I ordered 2 boxes so there‚Äôs enough when guests come over too!"
THESE ARE MY FAV I HAVE BEEN STCK ON THIS COLOR FOR A WHILE NOW I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I SEEN I COULD FEED MY FACE WITH THESE THEY ARE MADE STRONG JUST LIKE THERE COLOR I CANT WAIT TO GET ALL THE OTHER ONES I THINK THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT
"This silverware is GORGEOUS! The colors are amazing. It's so well made. I have already washed it, used it and washed it again. It's so fun to look at and use. For the price you can't beat this set. I'm going to gift this to people at Christmas! Buy it! You'll thank me later"
"Received our sets of silverware exactly as described! If you're looking for a new set that is fun and also DURABLE this set is great. Vibrant colors, good quality, and no changes to any of the pieces after running through the dishware. We will be purchasing an additional set as a gift."
"What can I say? I just love this flatware. Bought it for my Airbnb, where I decorate with a little more whimsy than my regular home. These have a good weight, or decently thick, and not at all sharp like cheap sets. The colors are beautiful. They just make me happy to look at. I think I‚Äôll be buying a set for my regular home just so I can see them every day."
"I‚Äôve had these for a while now. Use them every day and have washed a lot. The color is still intact and have not seen any rust. The size of the spoons are bigger than I thought. Overall, love this purchase"
THE FORKS ARE WONDERFUL THEY DO SPEAR THE FOOD (i hate forks that would not even go through warm butter) THE SOUP SPOONS ARE GREAT --- I JUST LOVE THE SET I NEEDED SOMETHING BRIGHT AND MAKES ME SMILE THEY DO!!!!!!
"The set arrived within a few days of ordering. It‚Äôs really well made, the iridescent colors are vivid. I‚Äôm looking forward to to using this for my next dinner party. The seller is easy to communicate with. I highly recommend this product."
Another impulse purchase that turned out to be awesome. We only use these utensils unless we run out and have to use the boring forks. Comes with everything a family of 2 would need
"I love this style of cutlery, so I had to get another set! I chose this company after searching around on Amazon, and I'm impressed. The forks and spoons are big but not too big, and the coloring on the whole set is very vibrant!"
I've seen the rainbow silverware in stores and really thought it was pretty. I found this on Amazon and it is perfect. I got a great price and bought 3 sets. I now have 12 place settings to go with my dinner dishes. It's stainless steel and each piece was individually wrapped. That was a surprise. Individually wrapped! Now that is a company that is contentious.
These are absolutely beautiful ! When I took them out of the box they were so shiny and colorful! When I take them to lunch at work everyone compliments me on them and asks where I got them. They wash so nicely and maintain that shine and color. Arrived early and in perfect shape. These are a must have for anyone looking for new flatware!!
I was so excited to get this! It looked so pretty in the pics and it didn't disappoint. I'm so happy with this purchase. My daughter wants to order a set too! Such pretty colors and is really durable. Great value for the money. We will be ordering more.
"So excited to leave this review, bought these on a whim, and I'm sooo happy I did. They are well made, not cheap at all. I will update my review after I wash them in dishwasher a few times, but so far after 2 washes they still look new."
"Purchased a set of 4 for my daughter to take to college with her. Chose these because I liked the colors - and figured it would be easy to distinguish what was hers vs. roommates. Great price, quick shipment. Expected them to be flimsy for the price, but they are heavy and well made - and so colorful!"
"I fell in love with this rainbow flatware. It is sturdy, hold up on the dishwasher and it is beautiful. The color will not peel off, they are durable....I definitely recommend this product if you want to add some fun flare to your meals."
"I have been eyeing this rainbow colored silverware set for some time now and finally decided to purchase. They arrived today and I must say they did not disappoint. The quality is very high for the price. The color is vibrant and they have a good weight to them, not flimsy at all. I hope to get a few years worth of use out of these. My guest will be really impressed when I pull these out."
I feel that the set I chose was a lot prettier than all of the sets I saw in stores. The price I paid was $23.95 which included WA sales tax. The ones in the store were over $39.00 and did not include WA sales tax. I have put them in the dishwasher with great results. They are really fun to use. Thank you Amazon!!!!
"Got a set like this from a store and I love them but needed more for a dinner party. I found these on Amazon and decided to take a chance because of the price. Long story short, I can't tell the difference between the two sets! Same size, weight and lovely coloring only I paid half of what I paid in the store! I'm thrilled! If these prove out to be as durable as my other set (and I think they will) then I'll be ordering another set just to complete a 12 setting dinner set"
This utensil set was very sturdy (good quality). I like that this set comes with two spoon and fork sizes too.  I had bought another version from Target and those were much lighter and seemed bendable.
"Always wanted to buy the metallic set ! FINALLY‚Ä¶ I was sent sale offer. Love love so far. Perfect balance , weight n strength for each cutlery piece. Might buy another for self. Also, be a great gift. I‚Äôm going to look for matching pieces. Iridescence is spectacular for your eyes and brain."
"These are perfect for my kitchen theme. They are nice, pretty, and very sturdy compared to other silverware I have purchased from other sellers. Will definitely be buying more when the time comes!"
"I have had these for about a month now and waited to give a review to ensure that they held color and did not rust. They are not a lightweight, cheap set. They have some weight to them and have stood up to a month's worth of use and washings. I am very happy with the product!"
Bought these as a gift for my granddaughter. Her children loves them so much they won‚Äôt eat with any other silverware!
"Estoy muy contenta con la compra y estoy considerando comprarlo de nuevo para tener el juego de 8 personas , lo recomiendo"
This silverware is amazing. I had some already and just ordered this set to have the extra settings when we have company and holidays. It is super sturdy and hold up well with tons of washes. It‚Äôs lightweight and easy to hold. Could not be happier with this purchase since we have started re doing our kitchen with all the ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù items.
Absolutely love this silverware set! I have received so many compliments. I recommend this silverware! It did not disappoint. Size and weight are perfect!
"I love the beautiful colors! Every piece is unique! I‚Äôve been wanting a set like this for a while, and we just moved into our new home and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. It‚Äôs very sturdy, not as heavy as I thought it would be which is great for the kids, and speaking of which, it was a hit with them! Planning on adding another set and possibly the kitchen utensils too! Thanks for a great product!"
"I was quite surprised and happy to get this set of tableware for such a low price. Super nice set, very high quality pieces, sturdy and well made, super shiny and durable. All the other sets were like three times the price."
It's definitely a great contrast with everything else that's black and grey around my house. They are a good thickness which makes them feel ultra durable.
"Beautiful!! My husband wanted bigger forks and these are wonderful. He absolutely loves these. So I bought another set. Every time we do dishes, he says these are so cool. Besides the looks, they are the sturdiest I‚Äôve ever used. You can tell by the weight. Happy!!!!"
"Good size and weight. Fast and easy service and delivery. Finish appears to be able to withstand normal use, but only time will tell. Satisfied enough that I already reordered another box."
"I am so pleased with this silverware set! I bought it because it was so cute but I never expected such high quality! It is solid and sturdy, much nicer than the few pieces I purchased elsewhere. The pieces are nicely sized and comfortable to hold in my hand! It is easy to clean, and air dries spot free! I am so happy I chose this rainbow flatware cutlery set! It is the prefect gift for anyone!"
I love this cutlery set. I didn‚Äôt tell my family what u had purchased just prepared dinner and had them sitting out ready or them to use. The response from my family was so pleasing. They are well crafted and durable I am so pleased with this purchase.
"I got this set to go along with my plain black stoneware dish set. I love the contrast, they compliment it so well! I've been using them for a few weeks now and no issues so far."
"This set is well designed, went through the dishwasher without issue, and is a nice size for adults and bigger kids. A great buy!"
"Although I've ordered this brand before, this particular shipment is a slightly different color but that's what I bought it for, it's unusual tint. It will never be confused with anyone else's silverware. And yes is easy to clean, not to mention the spoons and forks don't bend as easily as other silverware I've used! I'm going to add the steak knives soon."
These are my favorite new kitchen item. I LOVE the color. They are super sturdy and durable and still have their shine ever after several uses and washes. They are definitely worth what I paid.
Ive been using these for a few weeks and love them. They are very sturdy but not too heavy and look expensive.
Love this set! The detailed hammered smith design makes it look expensive and it has a nice weight/feel to it.
I was really worried these might come with sharp edges from manufacturing or something but they are all beautiful and such a great price!
Absolutely gorgeous! Study and high class! Ten stars! I will buy these again. They are very rich looking and clean easily
Love this set! Very sturdy and classy.
Super strong and durable. I really love the pattern. I am extremely pleased with them!
The flat ware was as advertised.
Beautiful set.
"I was hesitant buying silverware without being able to feel it, but was pleasantly surprised by the feel and quality of these pieces. Being a 40 piece set is definitely a plus. For the past few weeks this set has not disappointed one bit. I have also gotten a number of compliments on how nice the utensils are.  Would definitely buy again."
"It was better quality than I thought, the price was so reasonable for what I got."
I love this flatware set. It is classy and elegant gives the table an awesome looküòç
"Surprisingly thick, great quality for the price."
"Very nice set, good quality. Great price for a 12 piece setting!"
These are a super great value. They‚Äôre very attractive although they do retain water spots so you might have to wipe them. I bought the ones with the squirt off bottom so they a little sharp. The round ones might be easier to handle but I thought these were cuter.
"What an amazing deal. This full set of cutlery is on the level of Oneida, polished stainless steel, but the hammered pattern is hard to find. All four components complement each other, and have become our go-to everyday utensils. I'm beyond pleased I made this purchase."
"The utensils are exactly what we hoped for. They seem to be very durable, but we haven't had them that long to give an in depth review. I hand washed them and they didn't lose their shine. They will go in the dishwasher after use, so will update if we have any issues. The size of them are just as good as the ones we're replacing. We are very happy with this purchase."
"I searched for a set for a long time and came across a difference with rather bad grades and extremely strong prices. When I found this one and read the comments, I decided to give it a try. Not only is it a phenomenal product for an extremely reasonable price, but I would definitely buy it and it was twice as expensive if I knew in advance what I would get. I know for sure that I will buy the same again and I recommend 100 percent. I love it!"
"I got this set for my mom, she really needed a new one. And since she's usually hosting a large family, she needed a larger set. This looks great, loved the hammered style! She loved it as well. Can't beat the price for a 12-person setting."
"The pieces are surprisingly thick. You feel as if you are holding a fork. They look and feel durable, not easily bent, easy to wash and polish."
"The silverware is beautiful and my family loves the design on the handles. The packaging could be improved, maybe a nicer box, however I didn‚Äôt take off a star because the cutlery itself is pretty nice. Happy customer."
Felt heavy and durable. I feel like it could go with a variety of home d√©cor. I've had them for a few months and they still look nice and shiny. Great quality!
These came in the mail today.. I was so excited to see what these looked like in person. I ripped the box open and... OMG..These are gorgeous! So pretty! I immediately washed them and put them away so I can use them in the morning. Buy them already!
"This set is very sturdy and seems well made, plus they look great! No complaints at all from me. The large spoons may be too big for some people though I would imagine, they are slightly bigger than ones in what the average silverware set are. I like the larger size, so it works great for me."
I‚Äôve had over a month and some of the knifes have a blackish tarnish on them. Hoping that it‚Äôs not going to happen to all of them.
"Just as the other reviews have said, these have such a nice weight to them. They are not cheap or flimsy feeling. The butter knives actually have some sharpness to them which I love. All around I am so happy with my purchase. The price is excellent for a 60 piece set!"
"This is a beautiful set.. Eventhough I have not actually used these utensils, they seem nice and feels good in the hands. Being a 60-piece is a bonus."
I liked the new utensils had a very nice design
They look expensive and they got some weight to them. I always preferred flatware with a bit of weight so these are perfect. I‚Äôm tempted to get another set.
Great if you're a child or aidget. This silverware is tiny.
"Very impressed with this set of utensils. Unique, attractive and great quality."
"Very nice, sturdy silverware set. I like the hammered look and have held up well so far!"
"Easy to hold great quality very sleek, the design is deep not just a small indent had many many compliments on the look and quality."
I compared these with the very same pattern from a luxury department store for 10x the price. No difference in quality. Basically the very same thing. Yup!
I'm very happy with my purchase. I really like the design.
good value
"sturdy has ""heft"""
Great quality and great price! They do well in the dishwasher. I love the little forks because they are a perfect size for the kids.
"Great quality, very nice and great price for so many pieces. Love the design."
Nicer than I expected.
Great quality for a great price! They look so chic with the hammered handles.
"The silverware set looks good, but I wish the items would be heavier. Nevertheless, I think I'm going to enjoy them :)"
"Great Product, durable, shiny, and pretty. Good Quality!"
Very nice
These are very pretty and fun. I got compliments on them immediately.
Love them!
It seems durable and is stylish
Received wrong item
I love the design on this cutlery set. It looks really expensive but was very affordable.
sturdy and pretty. good value. really liked the product
Stylish dinnerware great quality.
I am very pleased with this flatware. Good value for the money. It came wrapped very well. It looks very nice on the table.
"I liked that they were heavy, but not too heavy . They are attractive and reasonably priced ."
Just what I need.
Good for the price but very light.
Get what u pay for
Sturdy and durable. Nice look.
El precio y la elegacia
Better quality than expected
"They are not hammered on the back, and they are not a good weight. Will be returning."
Awesome. Love them
The quality seems to be good and they give a bit more exclusive feel to them. I'm satisfied with the purchase.
Very nice the knives are pretty sharp nice.
"This is a really good deal for such a large utensil set. They are nice quality and hold up fine in our dishwasher. Be aware they don‚Äôt really look hammered, it is more of an imprint that looks like giraffe spots. In my photo the left is this product compared to different hammered utensil on the right."
"Thus is very nice flatware and a great pattern. Glad I got it I was tired if buying discount store stainless. This is much nicer, love it."
Beautiful set for ever occasion . Nice weight. Sizes are perfect. Loved that it is service for 12.
"Not the best/heaviest silverware I have ever used, but certainly very good. This set of 60 for just over $40 is a great value. The silverware is very sturdy and good quality. I really am happy I decided to purchase this."
Absolutely perfect! These are great quality & just stunning. The weight is perfect & I have ran these thru the dish washer several times and they still look perfect.
"Love this silverware set, So glad I purchased!"
"I really like these - but have other hammered that have the same look that are thicker.. For example, the forks have hammered on the front but not the back so it is thinner."
This is a really nice set. It looks awesome.
"Very happy with this set. I'm a fan of thick, heavy, solid utensils, and these are perfect. They have a good heft to them so they don't bend when trying to scoop ice cream out of the tub, but not so heavy you don't want to use them daily. you'd be hard-pressed to go to your local big box store and buy pieces of this quality with the utensil tray for the same price or less."
"These are awesome. Super nice for the amount you pay. Much better than the ""high end"" silverware you can buy at the grocery store. The steak knives are not as high quality and dont look like they will hold up, But the amount you pay for the forks, spoons, butter knives, and tray- well worth the money!!!"
"Pleasantly surprised by the craftsmanship at this price point. The holder is very sturdy, easy to clean, and provides enough space for extra silverware you might not be willing to part with. Plenty of small and large spoons/forks in this set. Steak knifes are sharp so be careful when handling!! Large spoons hold up well when scooping ice cream; no bending. Extremely happy with this purchase!"
Worth the money Had a little over 2 mths Love every piece Tray is too long for my utensils draw However overall i love it ‚ù§ Silver stainless steel
I have used these utensils for several weeks now. They look very sturdy and they have presented no signs of wear and tear. I will update again after several months if there is any change. The knives are serrated and they are good for cutting bread but not great for fruits and vegetables.
"UPDATE 12/27/19 So I used them on the 23rd for our special dinner and they held up perfectly. Even ran them in the dashwasher - zero problems. Now I am VERY HAPPY.  I have never had gold silverware, nor actually ever wanted gold. But for a special dinner for 4 people, it seemed that gold would be perfect. Because the silverware will be used very infrequently I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a set. In addition, I needed it right away. Leave it to Amazon to have what was needed with one day shipping. So the silverware is very good looking - not that awful brassy gold color, but a subdued classy gold. The sizes of all the pieces seem right, but we'll know more later tonight after my dinner. What's really great is that there are 5 pieces to each set which is just what was needed. I love that there are salad forks. The tablespoons are rather big and I'm going to use them as serving pieces. It comes with a very sturdy storage case and that's a bonus for those who need one. I don't but will keep it just in case. Before setting the table I washed them in a little soap and warm water and there were no spots, flaking or scratches. They look great with my blue tablecloth and white and gold Mikasa dishes. The price is very fair for this set and since I had points, this cost me nothing. I'm happy. If they perform as well has they look, I'm going to be VERY happy."
"Love the storage keeper, I would recommend"
This set is beautiful! It‚Äôs not too heavy but heavy enough to feel quality! Been using them for a few months with regular dishwasher use. Still perfect
"Was a gift, they like them"
I love my rainbow silverware. Planning on doing my entire kitchen based on these. Love them and planning to buy more.
"Amazing presentation, great finish."
"Love the fact that it comes with a tray, beautiful flat wear, very pleased, great price."
Good price. I love the tray organizer
Modern design. Good value at a decent price. The steak knives slice through meat like butter!
This silverware is so pretty! The utensils have great weight and the handles are longer than others that I've used. I enjoy using them!
Very Nice fits perfect in my drawer Great price
This was an awesome buy for the price and quality! Would definitely buy again.
A wonderful silverware set! One of the best sets I have purchased so far!
Met expectations. Quality product for reasonable price.
Really great silverware
I love them and worth more than the price!!
Came out exactly how presented. Utensils very light and look expensive. Sample and really nice
Great and must culinary set to have in the kitchen
This silverware was better than expected. Great value for the price.
Great for the money!! Nice an sturdy! Totally with the $$
Nice
Great set for our move to Colarado!
Sturdiness
Silverware is silverware works fine
The case is what made the difference. Helps me stay organized. Consider adding stirrers and chopsticks to the setup.
A+ for quality without a doubt the best bargain
Very good and happy with the purchase.
"Cute set for 4, great starter set !!"
"love the set color is great holds up well, dishwasher safe"
Just buy them. You can wash em. You can eat with em. They feel nice and heavy. Love it.
Good value for money.
Perfect for the price. I love it.
Very well packaged & great quality for the price.
Black Metal finish is rubbing off there were a couple that arrived liked that when opened and are now peeling
"The item was just like the pictures they are really good and the material feels and looks good, very satisfy with the item"
Very nice
Excellent set of utensils...
Item arrived with the silverware tray broken. I did not even bother to go any further. I am going to return the item. The box that the silverware and tray is packed in literally says fragile all over it. It even has extra foam taped to the box. This tells me that this is a huge problem with this company. I work in plastic injection molding for a living. The plastic is much too thin and brittle. As in cheap. I obviously never had the opportunity to use the silverware. But if the tray is cheaply made? I have to assume the silverware is as well. I will just buy something locally that I can touch and feel.
Great value and variety of sizes
Looks nice and and fit in my drawer nicely
Really good set for the price! Durable hasn‚Äôt bent or anything no defects. Ran thru the dishwasher 5 times or so still look perfect and the tray fits in my drawer perfect.
"Very nice, was what it said."
it;s a gift but looks like a good value and good quality flatware
Good value for the money. Happy that it also comes with a tray!
The sturdiness
Good product for the price
I really like this.
Perfect for start up set and apt use.
This product met all my expectations for daily use.
good quality!
The black coating is coming off. I have not owned these for a year or used much. The metal under the black coating started showing on the edges of spoons and forks. Not enough use on butter Knifes to see the coating failing. Hope no one in my house hold has swallow the coating. We stopped using immediately!
"The silverware is heavy, sturdy and feels like quality product!"
As described
They are strong and look good .
Very happy with this purchase. They look very nice & easy to clean. Highly recommend!
Thank you üòä
I really like them
Muy lindo
"Very nice set, and worth the price. No complaints."
Definitely lives up to the pictures. I‚Äôd buy again
Very good quality for price
"Sturdy, economical and average but decent looking. Best for daily usage"
"So far the silverware are great! They come individually wrapped and are wrapped in bubble wrap inside the tray. Upon removal of the silverware, part of the tray was cracked. I used some super glue on it and the pieces are holding well."
I really love my new silverware! I like heavy silverware and these are just right to hold. They feel expensive but were very affordable! Thank you!
Cheap and scratches and dents easily.
"I bought these about year ago. I have a few missing forks (gives kids the evil eye) so I was going to purchase a new set. For some reason just reordering these didn‚Äôt occur to me. So I purchase the closest looking ones I could find, because these are simple but beautiful. Paid $70 for a 45 piece set at Kohls. I didn‚Äôt even like them as much! Then I thought to go through my order history and see if these were still available. Yes and cheaper than what I purchased them for originally. People saying they are cheap and rust are crazy these lived up to a house full of teenage boys and not one single rust spot or bent utensil. I will say this if you need steak knives buy a steak knife set don‚Äôt use the extras in your utensil package."
"I read the mixed reviews on this flatware set. Some people loving it and some warned of rust problems. I decided to take my chances bc it is such a pretty set for such a great price. I was disappointed at how lightweight the pieces were,but decided i could deal with that. After 2 washes however,several pieces came out rusted. I couldnt deal with that. So I returned mine. If you cant deal with the rust,dont waste your time buying this set. It WILL rust."
"These are made in China now. Great work, Pfaltzgraff. Let's throw away years of German quality for cheaper labor. I bought these to replace a much older Pfaltzgraff set (when they were made in USA). While the new set is pretty enough, they are hard to keep clean. Like another reviewer said, if you let them air dry they show TERRIBLE water spots. So far, I can re-wet and wipe them off - but I NEVER had to do that with my old set. A few pieces came scratched (WTH?). I would NOT buy Pfaltzgraff again and will return the new set.  Photo shows water spots after air drying. Terrible, eh?"
"Looks great, nice quality. I always toss flatware into a glass of water to 'presoak' til I get around to loading the dishwasher once a day - have no issues with how the set is holding up. One thing to point out (and it's a good thing) the individual pieces are the correct size - the teaspoons are not too small, the soup spoons are not too big. Very pleased."
"4 stars on sturdiness and durability. I've seen much heavier weighted stainless. But I don't plan on digging dirt with it.  I absolutely love this pattern. I had bought 3/4 place settings but couldn't find one more. So off to Amazon I go. Happily they had this nice big set. Perfect! I could always use extra. Plus this set came with serving utensils and steak knives. Great price. Packaged very nicely. Even the the box was in good shape. Everything was in and accounted for. Unlike some reviews I had read. Silverware was in nice shape. No water spots, rest, or dings. Though these were made in China and the others I bought were from Korea. Everything matched perfectly in size and color. I would recommend this set to anyone. Especially people who are starting to set up house keeping. Great value."
"I could not believe it when my set arrived. I thought I maybe buying cheap silverware. But when they arrived, it met my expectations. This set is durable, elegant and I believe are made to last. However I do not wash in dishwasher. So I cannot Opini√≥n on dishwasher safe... I wash with a soft sponge."
"I've been through several sets of dinnerware over the years, and this may very well be the final set!! This product is heavy duty, quality made to last. The pattern is trendy, and my family loves them! It has everything you need for a dinner party of 8!"
"I was hesitant to order these without feeling, touching, or seeing first but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived and I absolutely love the set. Bought these for our vacation condo and now I‚Äôm going to order a set for our house."
"Great buy for the price! Purchased this for my cousin's first apartment. Not as heavy as Wallace or Reed and Barton, but not a lightweight either! Nice design. Forks have sharp tines. Steak knives may be plastic, but they're plenty sharp! And they all fit into the Tupperware flatware tray purchased on Amazon. My cousin is super happy and so are his roommates!"
Love these. Recently purchased these for our RV. They feel nice when you hold them. The larger spoons are great. I also purchased the matching serving set. The pattern stands out nicely on these. Great buy.
Love the design on the front and backside. Wash up nicely. Steak knives are very sharp. Serving spoons are a great size. Not heavy weight. But not too light weighted either. So happy with this purchase
This set was very affordable as well as a really pretty pattern. I bought this set for my daughter-in-law and went back and bought myself a set because I felt I would not find another deal like this in the future.
"I really can't rate these since I purchased as a Christmas gift thus I'm not opening the box. But, from what I can see it's a nice set and it's being added to the one our daughter already has and she loves them."
"I was worried these would be lightweight or easy to bend but we‚Äôve been using them for a month now and they have held up great. I love the design on them and they feel great in your hand. The large spoons are a bit smaller than I expected and the small spoons are certainly small, but with young kids this works out for me."
I love the set. Especially for the value. This is my second set that I bought. Not because they aren‚Äôt durable but because I have kids that lose them or throw them away LOL the set is very pretty and i would highly recommend this to everyone
"So far very satisfied with cutlery. I bought this ad a present for our 51st anniversary. The set that we were using, had lots of lost forks and spoons. And it was not as heavy as this set. This was important because spoons would bend if used to scoop ice cream from carton."
"I ordered a set a few months back. We were always running out of clean forks, so I decided to order another set. When it camez, everything was the same except for the tablespoons. They are larger and wider. I ordered the same exact set as I did the first time, so I was quite confused as to why the new tablespoons are larger."
"This is my first set of their silverware. I love the 5 different sizes and the serving set that all comes together. Not many people know what a true butter knife is, but it's in the set!! Heavier than I thought they would be. The design is timeless."
These feel nice & sturdy. I hate super lightweight thin silverware. The batter was a bit bolder than in picture but it‚Äôs pretty.
"Perfect weight, smooth edges, pretty, easy to clean. I love it! It‚Äôs wonderful to get this for about $40.00, can‚Äôt beat it!!"
If you need a basic set of flatware and like ones with designs then you won‚Äôt be disappointed with these. Easy to clean. Don‚Äôt tarnish (as of yet). Looks good
"53 pieces, you get a bargain for your buck. I love the design on the silverware and feel great about the purchase."
"Very pleased with this low cost silverware set the resting part I don't know about I can't say I'm resting a lot of people using lemon on stuff like this and it's really not good for them, it just seems to me things I've had in the past. Very nice looking. The spoons might not pass the ice cream test but I haven't been buying rock hard ice cream anywaynor does it get rock hard in my refrigerator so either."
""
"I love this set, it‚Äôs not only sturdy and durable it is absolutely beautiful! I bout them to go with my new dish set and stem ice tea glasses. I didn‚Äôt buy them to entertain with,I bought for everyday use but everything I bought can also be used to entertain."
"Nice flatware that will last for years! Stylish and high quality. I can sum this flatware up like this; it's not afraid of hard frozen Rocky Road ice cream and doesn't flex at all, yet would set a nice table for the in-laws! Will be buying again as disposal chews a few up or end up at disappearing because of the socks monster!"
This is a amazing set ! They‚Äôre very sturdy and durable. They are exactly as described and pictured. It‚Äôs a beautiful set and I‚Äôm very pleased with them .
"Pfaltzgraff, is a name I trust. Replacement for (oh you know that old forever and a day set, the one missing pieces ...like socks in the dryer?) New Design more contemporary, two contrasting surface treatments, ballance and weight. A complete overhaul of my flatware drawer...even has steak knives...happy happy joy joy."
"After a decade of using mismatched hand me down silverware from my sister, I decided it was long past time to get myself some pretty flatware. So happy with it, very pretty!"
"Beautiful craftsmanship, contemporary design, durable, holds up well in the dishwasher. Looks great next to fine China and not to pretentious next to chinet paper plates! üòÅ"
"I cannot think of enough good comments for this product. I love every piece. It is beautiful, durable and lasting in all aspects. Thank you for this order."
We absolutely love this set! It‚Äôs gorgeous and looks far more expensive than it is!
"These were perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner. They're not super heavy, but they're not dinky and lightweight either. The kids could use them without dropping them, and they were perfectly sized for the big adults to use. When I say big adult, I mean my father whose hands are more than twice the size of mine. Plus, the design is a nice way to add a little pizzazz to the table."
"They work as silverware should and have a good, comfortable weight to them"
Beautiful graceful design. Works well with our decor.
Absolutely beautiful‚Ä¶ Bought it for our Motorhome and everyone comments on how cool it is.. love them
Best silverware I've ever had
It's a beautiful set. I love it. There's a couple of mars on a couple forks but not bad enough to return just a couple forks to the company
Love the pattern on the silverware. I usually like a heavier feel but hubby likes the lighter feel. They have been through the dishwasher many times and no problem with the metal rusting or changing color. Very happy!
"This is our luxury dining set lol. They look amazing, feel great, and have got compliments from everyone when we sit down for adult dinners."
"So far, I love this flatware. The mix of satin and high-gloss is very attractive. They're a good weight--not too heavy or too light, so comfortable to hold. I just got them last week, and I ran all of them through the dishwasher before using. No problem. We'll see what happens after a few months of usage. So far I'm very pleased with this purchase."
Love our new silverware especially the design.
"I wanted a very modern, contemporary look and these are perfect."
"After 10 years of using mismatched silverware from a blended second marriage, we finally got a matching set. Love this set. Perfect sized forks and spoons. has serving wear. Steak knives are nice, but not the highest quality - they are good for daily use but not the ones I use for company."
I have been looking for new silver for a year! So happy with this pattern and quality. Highly recommend!
"This pattern is a semi current design, and built by a reputable manufacturer. Not just a cheap nock off, a well made reproduction."
"Been using these for over a month now with a family of 6. with very hard water here in the Poconos. I have no problems or complaints as of this time. Set looks nice, I don't think they are ad light weight as others have mentioned. Time will tell so far I love them"
"Beautiful set. The 8 steak knives felt like a true bonus. Just got them and already had 2 parties where I used them. They feel a little bigger than some of the flatware I've used before, but not heavier. The price is a steal."
I have really enjoyed having these utensils. Made of high quality materials and go in the dishwasher with no problems. The design is also very pretty.
Love the pattern and quality.
We bought this set to replace our boring plain flatware. It is very pretty and they are great quality.
"Good, sturdy utensils. We've had them for a few months at this point and seem to be holding up well."
We love the Pfaltzgraff Garland Frost set. They are beautiful and well made. Definitely recommend.
"My fiance and I decided it was time to graduate from dollar store cutlery to the real thing. Love the design, the weight is good, easy to clean and just all around great!"
Absolutely gorgeous set! They are so durable and the design is beautiful . Love the extras that come with it .
I loved these so much I bought a second box of them for parties. They are very nice and the pattern is beautiful. I get compliments from them at dinner parties. Glad I found them for our wedding gift registry. They are awesome.
Just what I needed
"I will be moving into my new house soon and I bought this for that occasion, so I haven't opened it. It is a marvelous price considering it's service for 8 along with serving utensils and steak knives! At less than $1 apiece, you can't go to Goodwill and buy tableware as cheap!!"
This is a very nice looking set if silverware. It's looks very sturdy. If I have any trouble with it after some use I will come back and amend my review. For now I'm very pleased.
"I haven't experienced any of the complaints in these reviews. No rust, good quality and weight- not too heavy. I've washed them in my dishwasher now many times with no issues. I'm very happy with my purchase."
"I love these! I saw them the first time at At Home but they were nearly twice the price there than they were on Amazon. I love pfaltsgraff as a brand, so I hope these last a long time."
"I am really enjoying this set. Love the details, and the quality is great."
"I love this set. The pattern is unique without being over the top. Has a good weight, feels good in my hand. I worry about rust, because it's been mentioned a couple of times in the reviews, but no problems so far!"
Excellent set..this is my second set and very happy with them.
I love this set. For every day use they‚Äôre perfect. I‚Äôve received a lot of compliments as they‚Äôre a nice looking set.
Very attractive
"I got my first set of these utensils about 3 years ago. I have had no problems with rust. They have discolored a little over time, but still look great. Will continue to use this brand."
"Just as pictured, great quality."
"Product was delivered quickly. Nice, sturdy set of silverware. Love the pattern."
I got this design cause it matches my other set that I got for my wedding present. If you want a set of silverware that is stylish and sturdy then this is the set for you. This is a great product with super fast delivery.
"the finish on one of the forks has worn off in sections and it‚Äôs showing signs of rust. We are very fussy about keeping our flatware clean. It gets rinsed, goes in the dishwasher, gets dried if needed, and then put away. The only thing that I can think of is that the underlying metal is defective.  The photos shows the rust (orange brown) and the underlying metal (black).  We bought them on Dec. 12, 2019 so we got 3 months use. Fro this much money, that's insane.  I‚Äôm very displeased."
"I waited to write this review until I‚Äôve used these a while since some reviewers noted problems with rust, and I‚Äôve had them a year now. I‚Äôm delighted and relieved to find none of these problems. They are a good weight, comfortable to hold, and stand up well to washing in the dishwasher. I‚Äôm pleased with how well they pair with my Fiestaware dishes since the banding echoes the stripes on the dishes."
Wow we are completely thrilled with these! We were looking for a quality set of flatware in stainless steel. This is am amazing set that is absolutely worth the money. Substantial weight that won't bend your spoons in the ice cream if you know what I mean! Really extremely well made and nice. THANKFUL to have found these! Fast ship too. Thrilled! Would also make an outstanding gift for the couple just starting out. Wish I had found sooner so we could have enjoyed longer!! But so happy to have them.
"I have bought and paid for 4 separate sets of stainless steel flatware since December looking for a regular set of silverware! It's the standard size and weight of the flatware we have always bought since keeping house for the last 46 years!! It isn't the glamourous set for fine dining but it will work! This flatware has a high gloss finish that is beautiful and holds up after running through the dishwasher. Most delightful of all it has the weight and balance that a good set of flatware should have. Another plus, it's not made in China!"
These seemed nice out of the box but quickly discolored with black spots all over them. Amazon customer service is useless concerning this item. Do not buy.
I love this flatware. Feels good in the hand. I like that it's slightly oversized. It is a classic design that works for casual or special occasions.
"We asked for this set for our wedding - as our everyday flatware set. So far - we love them! They're simple but elegant - and we love the brushed look! The serving utensil set is on the smaller side, but we're fine with that - for everyday usage for the two of us - the set is perfect!"
I love this set. It's pretty to start. It really enhanced the dining room table for Thanksgiving. The weight and balance is perfect and you actually feel like you are holding a utensil that screams quality. I bought it for the holiday table but it's great for everyday use I just can't get myself to stick it in the cutlery drawer so I'm not using it everyday yet. Haha I like this item a lot.
"I have ZERO idea why anyone would not give this flatware a 5 star out of 5. It is shiny, it is sturdy, it is heavy, it is sized well and it has a very classic design which can be paired with everyday plates to fine China. It is superb!"
"Very nice flatware, nice heft, shiny and doesn't appear to scratch easily. Made of the highest grade of stainless steel used in the industry. Very pleased with the purchase. Don"
"Feared buying without feeling the pieces, but counted on Mikasa name and ordered. The weight is substantial which will lead to durability and the pattern is perfect for our needs. For 12 place settings and serving pieces, one cannot beat the price."
I‚Äôm a younger guy never thought I‚Äôd be excited about silverware but I am. This brand is fantastic very sturdy and looks amazing I‚Äôve never used good silverware before but I got a new place and wanted to upgrade. Definitely made the right choice. I loved them so much I ordered 3 sets as gifts for my close family. Best brand ever worth the money
"Great value for a really quality set of silverware. I bought an extra set because we bought a house that had an extra kitchenette in the finished basement by a bar. It will be a great set for entertaining. My husband likes it better than our everyday silverware, but I like the style better, so we put it in the downstairs kitchen. Will have plenty for entertaining now."
"Ordered and received same day. Appear to be of high quality with a polished shine. There are no markings on the silverware. The box says made in Vietnam. I am assuming they are packaged for a number of different companies, thus no markings. Time will tell. Happy with purchase."
I bought this set after we lost a few pieces from a move. I am so pleased. The set is quite sturdy. Just heavy enough that it doesn't have that cheap feel. The set stands up to everyday use and lots of washing with no tarnishing. I am also very pleased with the serving pieces that come with the set. Overall it is a great value for the money. I would have expected to pay double for this quality
I am very happy with the Mikasa stainless that I got. I was a little surprised at the size of the forks but they‚Äôre OK. They are just larger than the very old styles. The silverware is a perfect weight with a beautiful finish. I would buy it for a gift or highly recommend it.
"I love this flatware. It is beautiful, has a nice weight and very reasonable for the price. Look forward to using it every day."
I love the weight and shine of this silverware. It feels good in the hand and compliments my dinnerware nicely. It can be used with good china as well as daily place settings. It's very versatile and a good value. I highly recommend it!
This silverware is beautiful. I am using my regular dishwasher detergent and so far not the slightest hint of rust. Very please.
"Very nice weight and I love all of the pieces. I was surprised by how large the larger spoon is (almost like a serving spoon, in my opinion) but it doesn't bother me. It's hard to tell in some of the pictures but the finish is shiny. We are very happy with the set!"
"This is the nicest silverware that I‚Äôve ever owned, even though I have had 18.1 sets before. Just love them and can‚Äôt wait to entertain!"
very sturdy.. does not get rust spots when hand or dishwashed. buy this product.
"Absolutely what I expected from Mikasa. Similar quality to Oneida, very lovely to look at and hold. This specific pattern is on the larger side, so be sure you prefer that."
"These are solid, with a nice, simple pattern, with just enough style. Beautiful shine! Love my new flatware!"
"I love these, they are a nice weight and look great on my table. A very good value for the money!"
Nice quality with style. Made very well that I would compare to pier one silverware. Very happy with this set
"Mikasa dinner ware (plates, glasses and utensils) never fail to be really great quality, beautifully crafted, and a great value. I've bought Mikasa over the past 30 years, for myself and for gifts."
"A little pricey but, beautiful, smooth silver finish makes the price more bearable."
"This is a really nice looking flatware. It is much heavier than previous flatware I have owned. Also it is longer. The basket in the dishwasher does not support it as well. Sometimes it must be adjusted in the basket to push the rack in. Overall, happy with it & makes a nice table setting."
"I was looking for a product to replace my current everyday silverware. This set is great. It is not too heavy, but not so light that it bends. All pieces fit perfectly in the dishwasher silverware holder and have been holding up great (about a month). Loved that it was a 12 place setting set."
"No regrets, the description is very accurate and the quality is very good."
"Solid, sturdy, classy, and functional. They clean nicely in the dishwasher and have a nice weight to them."
We wanted a heavier set of silverware with a wider handle as my husband's hands shake. He approved them as they work great for him (me tooüòâ)We use them for everyday silverware. We wash them by hand and they stay so shiny ‚ú®Ô∏è.
"We love this set of flatware. It‚Äôs even better looking in person. I was concerned by reviews that the forks might be too big, but we love them. The salad fork is a little bigger than our old ones but I never used my old salad forks because they felt too small. These feel really good in my hand. The knives are sharp and are holding up well with daily use. Great purchase."
The Mikasa Harmony set has been the best silverware set we have owned over the past 40 years we have been married. Wish we would have purchase them from the start!
Was exactly what we were looking for. Very durable and great price!!
"I‚Äôm very choosy and I love the silverware! It‚Äôs simple, yet elegant. Sturdy, yet light weight, would highly recommend it!"
These are a great value! They are well made and have a great feel. I wish they had a serving set to match. ( the set comes with a set of serving pieces)
Nice weight and feel
This set is heavy and well-balanced. It‚Äôs a very good value.
Not sure what all the rust complaints are all about. We use the dishwasher everyday and have no rust or spots on this set. High quality for everyday use. Very happy with our purchase. Highly recommend buying this set.
This is the shiniest silverware I've ever seen. The pictures do not do it justice. Nice and heavy too.
"I love this set. It has a nice weight to it and is ""balanced"". If you are considering this set, I recommend purchasing. Looking for extra spoons as we always seem to lose one or two."
I love the heaviness of the silverware and the design. We wanted the most pieces available in a set with serving utensils. This is a great deal and exactly what we wanted.
Well made and much sturdier then any of my previous silverware. I very happy with my purchase. Washes and dries well in dishwasher.
"Really good quality, very strong and dont stain"
Super nice set! Very elegant and worth every penny!
For everyday use
Beautiful design. Sturdy feel. Looks great with any dish set.
Holding up well and looking great. Heavy duty stuff. We love them!
Beautiful flatware and just what I wanted.
"This set is exactly what I wanted, and exactly what was promised. Heavy, shiny, really nice!"
I gave thud set to my son who recently moved into his own home. He is happy with it and it's very easy maintenance. Successful gift!
"The silverware arrived nicely packed. All pieces were individually wrapped. The pieces are a heavy weight, and the design is beautiful. The forks and spoons are fairly large, compared to my old set. They will look great even with fancy dinner on my china!"
We found this silverware at Bed Bath and Beyond and we picked it for our wedding registry but ended up buying it on Amazon because of the cheaper price. This silverware is heavy and is great quality.
Nice quality and finish
Love the sleek lines. Its beautiful and simple lines make it look like fine silverware.
"These are beautiful, simple but elegant. These have a wonderful weight and are good quality, highly recommend."
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
"Nice, heavy weight flatware I bought a few sets for a dinner party and really like it. I would recommend this if you dont want something that feels cheap."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!! They are the perfect weight.....a little heavy, but that is what I was looking for! Very pretty and great for everyday use."
Love this set Beautiful mirror finish. Great weight. So happy I purchased!
"Wasn‚Äôt what I expected.,"
If you like heavier and larger utinsils these are perfect. I have run them through the diswasher several times and they still look new.
Loved the silverware. Definitely recommend it and will ordered again. Ordered for our vacation home and hubby liked it better than what we have at home.
Love the set. Finally I have a nice placesetting. BEAUTIFUL.
We love our new everyday silver. Took a couple weeks to decide. After a great deal of research we landed here and love it! Heavy and many pieces. Have washed several loads of dishes and no issues at all!
Value for money
I was very pleased with the quality and heaviness/sturdiness of this Mikasa flatware. It's so shiny and beautifully smooth. No rough edges and every piece was perfectly made. Been using it a month now and I still LOVE IT!!
"Sturdy, as advertised."
"I am not sure what happened to my last set of silverware, but in the course of the last year or so, most of my spoons went AWOL. I sort of expected it when I had a toddler, but that never happened. Now that he's a teenager, spoons are suddenly scarce. That's in addition to the several that took rides in the disposal, since no one actually looks before they push the button.  I wanted to have more than three spoons in my three person household, but didn't want to spend a fortune in case this trend of silverware abuse/theft continued. I took a chance on this set since it's so well reviewed.  It's easily better quality than the more expensive Farberware set that it's replacing. It's also better reviewed than that set, which I'd been debating buying to just add to the remaining pieces I have. It's heavy, doesn't stain or rust in several runs through the dishwasher.  Overall, I'm really pleased and pleasantly surprised!"
"I bought this product for my daughter, who moved into her own apartment last week. It looked very nice online, but I was worried it would be less than acceptable once I saw it in person. Surprise! It was wonderful craftmanship, really lovely quality, simple, elegant, and such a terrific price. My daughter loves her new flatware, and I'm going to order another set for myself! Sarah A."
Lov my silverware it stat shiny after as many times as I clean an reuse it I recommend that anyone purchase this one it's a great deal durable an awesomely cleans nicely
"Bought these to use in a short-term rental. I needed something inexpensive enough that I could buy an extra set to occasionally replace missing pieces, but also nice looking and durable.  They feel a bit thin, but they're actually quite strong. The look is elegant and simple. No rust or anything after a 5 months of use. They are exactly what I needed.  UPDATE after 18 months of use: I occasionally get rust spots on the knife blades. Only the knives and only on the blades, not the handles. This happens when the knife is either laid in the stainless steel sink or left in the dishwasher touching other steel utensils while wet. It's obviously some galvanic corrosion due to dissimilar metals. The rust comes off relatively easily, but leaves behind spots on the blades that are no longer polished.  Also, I bought a second set and noticed in that set there are two forks that are bent slightly different from the others from the factory, so they don't stack nicely."
"I purchased these as a gift for a family member; it was a holiday dinner and I knew they didn't have enough flatware for everyone that was visiting. I washed the set in advance and was quite impressed! This flatware is very substantial, especially for the price. I prefer the stainless without the nickel. The nickel is what creates the grey marks on your dishes. I almost prefer this set to my name brand flatware. I would buy these again."
"Sleek and basic design and sturdy. I have problems eating ice cream with some of the cheaper brands(they bend). My kids have this weird tendency to accidentally throw away silverware while clearing their plate, so yet again I had to purchase more. I would buy this brand again for the sturdiness. I didn't need the extras such as the sugar spoon and butter knife, but I suppose they're nice to have extras of as well."
"I've had the set for a few months now. They are sturdy and really great for the price, no complaints. Though the large spoon and fork are VERY big haha"
Great quality flatware at a great price. Has nice weight to it and feels good in your hand.
"These are fantastic!! I had recently bought a couple of different sets that were high end, 18/10. Wanted the best. They rusted or where scratched and had to send them all back. I found these for much cheaper and they have been great. Been using for a few months now and still very happy. Easy to clean, dishwasher safe, sturdy and solid. Great Product! Thank you!"
"As a rule, silverware is silverware. However I recently changed residence and somehow my silverware was either forgotten and left behind or during the unloading of the van it grew legs and walked off. I ordered your silverware because it was pretty and matched my dinnerware. We suffered with plastic until it arrived and when it did I was amazed at how pretty, well-made and sturdy they were. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"I purchased the Brightown 45-Piece Silverware Flatware Cutlery Set originally to replace pieces I had missing in my own set. But the Brightown made all the other old flatware in my drawer look old and dull so I removed all the old and placed my new Brightown. It's made very well. Sturdy pieces. beautiful and sleek, and I received my product within 2 day - Kuddos to the Customer Service Team for that. I'm so happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this set for anyone looking to replace their old set. Beauty and affordability. Brightown will be my go-to for flatware in the future."
"Love the simple lines, looks great with any type of dish. cleans up beautifully, and have no problems showing it off!! The price was wonderful for all the extra pieces that were included.. Would recommend this product."
Great set! Plain silverware at a reasonable price.
"I‚Äôm actually very impressed by this flatware set. I was looking at Kohl‚Äôs, Target, Walmart, and Amazon all at the same time, trying to find a decent quality for a decent price.  This was it! We have plenty of pieces for our family plus some. It‚Äôs a nice weight and feels durable. I went ahead and threw them in our dishwasher to check how they did. All washed great!  So far, we are very pleased with the look and functionality.  I read all the reviews before buying (yeah I am that person), go ahead and order! You can get them in 2 days and you won‚Äôt regret the quality at all."
"Absolutely love this silverware, sturdy, easy to clean, beautiful durable shine, quality workmanship, and extremely comfortable to use. Comfortable in the hand, extremely smooth to the mouth and lips, no rough or sharp edges. Actually this flatware has surpassed my expectations, I wanted flatware to replace the mismatched ones we were using to a standard set. Reviewed quite a few, looked and looked until I see these on Amazon. Caught my eye, upon review I read the maker takes pride in the flatware smoothness / luster / and workmanship, let alone they show a micrometer helping explain the sturdy structure of the flatware. Yes, I recommend the purchase of this product, no second thoughts about it."
"I bought this set thinking it would likely turn out to be pretty crappy, given the low cost. I was swayed by the reviews and took the plunge and I‚Äôm thrilled to report that this is indeed a great set of flatware. I‚Äôve used them for at least a month now, tossing them in the dishwasher with each use, and they‚Äôre great! No issues. They‚Äôre a nice weight, no rust, no problems at all. I highly recommend."
"Hard to beat a full service for 8 at this price. As my review title says, these are not at all fancy but a great set for everyday use. They are well made and haven't had any issues running them through the dishwasher. We actually ran them in the dishwasher before the first use and they came out fine. The set was complete, along with the serving set, and no defects. Each piece was individually wrapped in a plastic sleeve. Seller's description is accurate and the set lives up to the claims."
"Exactly what I was shopping for: no frills, sturdy, utilitarian, mid-class resto quality. But a bit over-sized, for my tastes (admittedly, I did not look closely at the specs), and the larger forks are almost...weapon-worthy. The smaller of the two types of forks are the same size that I (gen-x) knew as the larger fork. I mean, the tines, from the point to the curve, on the *small* fork, are almost two inches long, which is a hair longer than the large forks of my vintage set. (A suitable choice of cutlery for such dark times, I guess, but this review isn't about feudalism, overt consumption as a power move, or the bleak history following either--these are just really big big forks). Oh, the handles do smudge quickly, so be prepared to lightly buff the handles after you set table for company, if you're persnickety."
"I thought that I was ordering some replacement flatware to ""get by"" since my family and I were long overdue in purchasing new flatware after an out of state move last year. I thought that I was purchasing something to hold us over until I had a chance to shop for some upscale replacements perhaps during the holidays or during online Black Friday deals. So, I made the plunge and ordered this flatware set. My family and I are MORE THAN pleased with our purchase. The only thing that I am upset about is taking so long to find and order this set before now!"
"They are huge, Jerry huge. The salad fork is a lethal weapon. The butter knives barely fit my utensils organizer. They are strong, ice cream didn't bend my spoons and it was frozen solid. So it might take you a few uses to get use to the size. The style is pretty much minimalist as they are pretty basic in design. They are one of the better sets I have used for strength. I hate weak neck utensils."
"We just received the silverware and we absolutely love it. The appearance is great and it looks like it will retain its appearance due to the finish. The weight is perfect, not light but no too heavy to be uncomfortable. We have not had the set long enough to evaluate the durability, but I will update after we have had it for a while. I would recommend this set."
"These are nice pieces of flatware for everyday use. There are not overly ornate; they are just useful. I didn‚Äôt want feminine flatware, and these fit the bill. They have a great balanced feel to them and therefore don‚Äôt feel cheap. It is a great plus that they are are dishwasher safe. I cannot imagine that anyone would be disappointed in them. I expect that they will last many, many years since they seem to be so well constructed. An added bonus: the set comes with a few extra pieces not found in most sets. Check out the details online."
"This flatware is unique and elegant in design, weight and thickness- made of 18/0 stainless steel with a glossy mirror finish and a slightly elongated handle which make them well balanced and easy to grip. I am replacing my current flatware and was extremely pleased when I received this 45 piece set of Brightown flatware! It‚Äôs just what I was looking for."
"My flatware arrived yesterday and I was so pleased. The pieces are a nice size and feel comfortable and substantial in the hand. The finish is smooth and bright. They appear to be very well made, and the price was great. Can't wait to clean out my old silverware drawer today and donate them so I can start using these new ones. They'd make a great gift!"
"We needed a new set of everyday tableware. While looking around on the internet I came across an interesting collection of nicer looking stainless steel knives, forks, spoons - and the priced was right. When the order arrived I was even more surprised at how nice the finish was on this set of tableware - almost like silver. And this stuff came out of the dishwasher looking just as nice as before use."
"When my ex and I split up I got half of the silverware. I made due but ended up having to hand wash utensils more often than running the dishwasher. I found these and went ""SCORE!"" These are incredible. I will never have to wash a fork, spoon, or knife again!"
"I‚Äôm overall very happy with this set. Nicely finished, a good ‚Äúheft‚Äù to the pieces, neither too light or heavy. My only unpleasant surprise is that the knives are too long to fit in my standard Rubbermaid plastic cutlery tray that I‚Äôve been using for years. I never considered that before my purchase. Be aware. Other than that I‚Äôm pleased."
"This flatware feels like it is a good, quality made product. My concern was, that for the price, the flatware would feel too light and cheap while using it. It does not! I am very happy with this purchase and I may buy another set soon to assure I have replacements when spoons etc. disappear or are ruined. I hope the shiny surface does not dull to quickly, but I believe if I dry them instead of letting them air dry the finish will remain shiny."
"I had to buy new flatware after my nieces and nephews came to visit and destroyed my existing set.... I will just stop there.  So I gave this 45 piece set a try and was very impressed with the appearance, weight, and quality! The bonus utensils were nice also. I really recommend this set.  Now I just need to buy a lock for my kitchen drawer and when my nieces and nephews come to visit, have them sign out their flatware going forward : )"
Very heavy stainless along restaurant grade. Much nicer than the set I paid $60 on sale at Sam's Club a few years ago. So happy with the set I bought for my kitchen that I bought another for my daughter for Christmas.
"This set is just perfect for our use. It is on the lighter side, but looks very nice and is sturdy. Cleaned nicely in the dishwasher with no discoloration."
"I absolutely love this cutlery! I was waiting until we moved to get a new set and was disappointed when I was only gifted one box before it was out of stock. Luckily it is back in stock and I was able to grab a second box. Definitely order 2 sets if you have a large family or love to host, it saves you from washing dishes right away. The grip is easy to use for me and they can go in the dishwasher without issue. I‚Äôve had them almost a year now and we still love them!"
These are perfect and most closely match the existing set I have. They are a nice weight and won't bend like some sets. I purchased two sets instead of the larger set. For a few dollars more I have addition place settings plus two sets of serving utensils.
"It had a nice finish on it and did not spot from the dishwasher. There were extra pieces with it such as a sugar spoon, large serving spoon and a slotted serving spoon and a meat fork. Happy we purchased it."
"I order these to replace another set, my husband order a set of the original set that running away from home , the forks left then the spoons runaway, anyway I was going to return them buy my son-in-law wanted them. I would recommend you to buy these, the price isn't bad neither."
I BOUGHT THIS TO FILL IN EXISTING SET AND NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WOULD BLEND IN. IT HAS WORKED OUT GREAT! IT IS A NICE WEIGHT AND LOOKS JUST AS PICTURED. I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD BARGIN. RECOMMEND...
"I am very happy with this purchase. Good quality, durable, sleek flatware. They seem very sturdy and the design goes with everything. This will be a great everyday flatware for the family to use. And the serving pieces are a nice bonus. I would buy again/recommend to others."
"This is a very nice set for 8 people! Not super easy to find set of flatware for 8, so I‚Äôm happy to have found this at the price point it was! The weight is decent = not as heavy as high-end but not as light as cheaply made. Set does show every fingerprint and smudge, though, which is kind of a bummer."
"The goal of purchasing this simple flatware set was as a holiday backup, but as many of the reviews have noted, it‚Äôs really nice simple set, far better than I expected for the money, no bending forks or flexible spoons to be found lol:)) honestly I‚Äôd used this as everyday flatware without question and I suspect another set will be finding its way to my home to do just that. Thanks again~ T"
I purchased this set for my grandson for his new apartment. I am sure he will use the silverware for many years. He lives across the country from me so I haven‚Äôt seen them. He was very happy.
I looked very long got a good quality set of silverware and I‚Äôm happy with it after 6 months. It came with a lot of useful utensils I wouldn‚Äôt originally use. It‚Äôs very sturdy and gets the job done. Well worth the money.
"This silverware is great! We've had this a few months now and it's held up perfectly. I was worried the metal would be thin but, these are really thick and sturdy.  I was looking for a basic set with tons of forks and spoons and this was definitely a great find."
"My son's new wife loves them! The set they had was a part metal, part plastic crap that broke all the time. They have young children and I didn't want broken plastic in the food!"
"Replaced a set of silverware that was pretty similar in design. I like a more simple look. These are a nice weight and sturdy, really happy with the set. Wash in dishwasher with no issues. I bought the first set to test out, now will buy more."
"The Flateware set looks nice, has a good feel and is solid. I washed it after receiving it before using it per the included instructions. I recommend this set."
"Nice. Very shiny. No sharp edges. It will definitely do the job. Honestly, though, not as good as the reviews stated in comparison to high quality silverware. I sent it back because it wasn't any better than what I already have."
Good quality. Nice weight and size. Been washed multiple times now with no rust spotting or anything like that. The spoons are a little pointyer than I like but that's my only complaint. Great set for the price. I got 2.
"I gave these flatware to my son as a gift. I did not take them out of the box before giving them to him. There were plain and had no design on them and I was worried they wouldn't look very nice, but I was mistaken. When I was invited over to his place for Mother's Day, I opened up the drawer that had the flatware, I was extremely pleased to see how beautiful and elegant they looked. Very nice."
I bought this flatware for my daughter who was missing so many pieces to her other set. I bought this set for her and she just loves it!!
This is a great cutlery set. It is extremely easy to hold and has a smooth finish. My order came with 3 sets of spoons and was missing 1 set of forks but the company easily and quickly resolved it and shipped out the replacement forks. I am happy with my purchase
The product arrived timely. I purchased these for my wife to replace our old aging and cheap silverware. They fit the requirements of my wife likes them. Hopefully they will last a long time unlike our last set.
"I bought this for my girlfriend and I. A year has passed and the set has proved to be of the best value. Other sets cost around $1 per piece or more. This is a great starter set and the additional serve spoons, butter knife, and serve forks were delightful to have too. Definitely a great starting option but upgrade in the future to a nice Lenox set."
I needed a new set of flatware because some of my current set went missing. I was worried at first because of some of the reviews but they were on sell and Im on a budget. Got them and I am completely happy with them. They aren't fancy but they are nice looking and my husband couldn't tell the different from the old ones we had. He still doesn't know I bought knew. lol I did end up with an extra fork in the long ones but that's ok. I would rather have 9 then 7.
This cutlery set is very sturdy...the spoons are deep and was an amazing purchase. I an very pleased and highly recommend this set
"I‚Äôm really surprised, this set was inexpensive so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised they are comfortable to hold. I have arthritis and some utensils are to narrow these are notüòä"
I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of this flatware. I would definitely purchase again. I can't comment on the durability since we've only had them for a month. I have no reason to believe they won't hold up well.
"I was pleasantly surprised by this silverware set. They are heavy duty, minimalist design and have not tarnished or spotted."
"As a foster family, we need a lot of silverware!! I love this new set!! They are a great value, easy to hold, and easy to clean! And they are super durable!! I‚Äôm really happy with this purchase!!"
"We were in the market for a new set of silverware and this set from Brightown was the perfect fit. The set is very durable and they wash great in the dishwasher. Not to mention they look great on the dinner table and after multiple washes, they have not lost any shine. The extra 5 pieces of silverware also were a great addition for both serving as well as prep and the sugar spoon is used daily.  For anyone looking for an affordable set that will look great in the silverware drawer as well as on the table, i highly recommend this set!"
The flatware has some weight to it so the fork or spoon won‚Äôt bend when some pressure is put on it. It is a great item as is the price.
"I wanted to clear out some old silverware and find a new, reasonably priced set. These are perfect for my home, they look and feel great and they've stayed super shiny for weeks now. I'm very happy with my purchase and when my family expands, may consider buying another set!"
"Very pretty. Friends had this set, I liked it so I ordered it also. I am getting ready to order another set"
I needed a new set of tableware and these fit the bill. Really good quality with a no design on them which I like.
"I love this flatware! Very easy to hold, sturdy, and easy to clean. Other flatware that I had bent and scratched easily. I also love the look of the flatware and the extras (serving spoons, sugar spoon, butter spreader). A great buy!"
Overall restaurant or hotel level quality. I was pleasantly surprised as I did not expect such a nice sturdy heavy weight set!
"I have had many sets of Flat Ware and this one is great. Pretty, sturdy but not too heavy!"
"I wanted a sturdy nice looking silverware. This is exactly what I wanted!! Nice looking, sturdy, and I would definitely buy again"
I purchased these because of the price and quantity were very reasonable. I love them! The dinner forks and spoons were just the size I wanted. They have great shine and seem like they will last a very long time. Great product.
"We bought these for a RV, but I would have kept them for the house. Extremely well made and a great look. Buying these online you are never sure how they might turn out, but these did not disappoint us. They are totally as advertised and arrived quickly!"
I really like my new silverware ! It is nice and shiny ! they are pretty sturdy and have a nice weight to them. The only thing I don't care for is the fact they show fingerprints ( LOL ).
The description does say black. The pics appear to me as silver. My mistake for not reading through. They are certainly beautiful but definitely black.
I was nervous that The knives weren‚Äôt sharp but they work amazing! Look amazing!
I loved it when I saw it on Amazon but it doesn‚Äôt do it any justice. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
"Stylish design, quality materials, easy to use"
Well done
"The knives are worth the whole price. I actually just ordered another set. The teaspoon is for the hand and mouth of a 5 or 6 year old. Had they been a proper size, I really would have given it 5 stars."
"These are very sturdy, nice size. Wish it had more then 4 forks but that‚Äôs fine other then that they‚Äôre perfect set."
Salad forks and serving pieces not available in this set.
"I would've given this a higher rating if the teaspoons weren't missing. I only received a 12-piece set instead of the 16-piece set I paid for.  Updated review:  I've updated my rating, not only because the seller sent me the missing teaspoons, but because he was very responsive and quickly corrected the issue. He also kept in contact to update me on the whereabouts of my order. I really appreciate this seller. The flatware itself is gorgeous and sturdy. I'm very pleased that my set is now complete. Thank you!"
"Been wanting an upgrade and really like the color, feel, and new silverware. The small spoon is the only complaint. It doesn't fit the hand well nor is the spoon moderate size..think teaspoon rather than tablespoon."
The product has a nice weight & it is as advertised.
This set is absolutely exquisite and is a focal point whenever I place them on the table. No issues with placing them in the dishwasher and always comes out looking like brand new.
"I am very pleased with this cutlery set. They're elegent , easy to grop and the knives are amazing"
This is a beautiful set of cutlery. I am so incredibly disappointed they do not make a hostess set to match. it looks lovely on the table!
Stunning
"I am very happy with my purchase. Beautiful set! Very sturdy, good quality, comfortable to use and not too heavy or bulky, just perfect"
"The set is good, but not made for every day eating. We bought the black set and it came darker and therefore glossier than what is pictured for the black set and as you can see in the picture, the small spoon is quite literally for tea stirring or the like. Extremely small and not built for anything other than stirring."
Very pleased with purchase
"Returning. Not as pictured online ‚Äî solid BLACK. However the utensils‚Äô proportions are what really bugged me. The soup spoon is more appropriate as a serving spoon. The smaller spoon is only slightly larger than a demitasse spoon. If all you want is a knife and fork, the set would be fine."
I bought the set because it is black. I was surprised how light the utensils are and I like how well made they are.
Product came on time. Looks great. Works well (excellent knife). Bought to replace but like it even better than my originals.
Beautiful. I went online to order more but they were sold out.
"i haven‚Äôt use it yet, it looks beautiful"
"The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the actual pieces are darker than what the pictures show. That said, I love this set. Each piece feels great in the hand and solid without being heavy. The knife cuts beautifully. Steak, tomato, cheese, bread... works great on all.  Others comments said the teaspoon is too small. I disagree. The teaspoon is actually that: a teaspoon. It's the proper size, and gives a reason for having it. No need for two spoons of roughly equal size, like most sets have."
"With my Italian husband my old clutter set , the knifes were useless to eat a steak. And had to have the serrated ones also in the drawer. With this new set no longer the need for those black handle serrated knifes. No i can use the knifes from the clutter set and cut no problem my steak, bread, and everything."
This silverware is beautfiul! Nice weight and look very classy! Wash up great in the dishwasher as well! Absolutely love them.
"La verdad es que este juego de cubiertos valen cada peso pagado por ellos, son igual que las fotos, resistentes, de un tama√±o adecuado aunque las cucharas y cucharillas son algo largas, siguen brillando igual que cuando las recib√≠, el cuchillo excelente, cortan f√°cilmente la carne, verduras, no son como los cuchillos de carne que cuando quieres cortar algo suave como una crepa solo la despedazan, estos no cortan cualquier alimento."
Its been only a week using them. And I wash them in dishwasher. The cutlery set is beautiful and very presentable and shiny. I just hope they turn out durable and the gold does not wear out. Happy with my purchase
Arrived today and this cutlery set has exceeded all expectations. It is just stunning. Very happy indeed
"I purchased an 8 piece of this set/style in 1996. Fast forward to 18 years later. We now have 4 kids and are a family of 6. We are still using our original set and they are still in excellent condition. Have a great feel when you hold them, clean well, etc. Now that our family has grown so much, I just recently realized that we are always running out, which Is why I purchased this 20 piece to add to our set.  I am not sure why there are any negative reviews for this flatware set. There are a few differences between our 1996 version, but I would consider these changes an improvement. The butter knives are now one whole piece of metal, whereas our original knives are actually two pieces. The handle for the butter knife is not as thick as our original knives but I don't see that as an issue. The knives, old or new, still feel great to hold. If I had to choose which knife I like better, I would say the new version. One piece of metal versus two, should last even longer.  This design is simple but yet elegant. 18 years and going strong. What is there to complain about! We like them so much we came back for more."
"I‚Äôve had a set of the Oneida Flight utensils since I had my first apartment years back and needed more, since now I have a little family and my boyfriend and I are horrible at washing dishes regularly. This set matches my original set. I‚Äôm not really sure about the people that have mentioned that it is a different material/weight as previous older versions of this design. To me, it feels the same. Overall, I like this design because it is simple without being plain."
"I bought my first set of his pattern 23 years ago. Over the last year, my teen sons have used some of the spoons to scoop ice cream and a couple of the knives have started to come apart where the handle meets the blade. So, I purchased this set to replace damaged pieces. They look as good and feel as good as the originals."
"Like the looks and sturdiness of this silverware. It does not rust. Wish it came with, or had the option to purchase matching vegetable spoons as well. Would highly recommend."
I bought these to add to my mom's to serve more people. Great quality & weight & balance in the hand. Highly recommend.
Bought silverware to replace some silverware that have gone missing since buying original set 13 years ago when married... match nicely and made well. I like it because it‚Äôs not too heavy or bulky like some newer styles of silverware but it‚Äôs not cheap and flimsy.
The weight of each utensil is great and balanced. The price is great and looks nice!
"I was trying to match my current set that has lasted, needed more settings. Perfect."
This set seems very sturdy and durable for every day use. It has a good weight to it. It is however shinier than pictured.
Beautiful and classic pattern
I bought these to match my very old set. I cant believe I found them! The knives are different though. They are flatter now. My old set is rounded. But the rest of the set is the same. You can‚Äôt tell the difference. These wash well in the dishwasher. I have no issues with rust. I bought them a long time ago and they are still very nice.
"I like the smooth, elegant style. The weight is balanced and comfortable in my hand."
I've had a set of these for almost 15 years. Being able to get replacement pieces makes these an excellent value. They will never wear out or go out of style.
"Love the style and quality of the product. I was in need of new silverware, my current one was 20 years old. When these new ones arrived we were amazed at how nice they cut everything, even meat! Glad I bought these!!!"
Very slightly different than the set we purchased 25+ years ago. It's a close enough match that you need to look closely for the difference.
Oneida flatware is great quality and I love the simple but elegant design of this flatware.
"We like Oneida and we like this pattern, had it for 50 (?) years. Bought more for the kids. Wash them in the dishwasher chemicals. They come out just fine, year after year. No complaints."
"We purchased this set of flatware for four as an add-on to previously purchased set for eight. We have been quite satisfied with our flatware purchase to date. I like the feel, it has just the right amount of heft to it as far as I'm concerned. It cleans up well in our dishwasher and has retained its shine."
Bought for son and daughter-in-law. Perfect weight for silverware
"I forgot that I had put them on my wedding registry! So when I received a set of these as a wedding gift, I was pleasantly surprised. They have held up great throughout the years and I still absolutely love the simple, but elegant pattern to them. The butter knives are a good weight making them comfortable to use, I just wish they (the knives) didn't take up so much room in the silverware tray/drawer."
Love this silverware! Have had my original set 20+ years. I just keep adding more when we misplace pieces :)
Beautiful!! So glad I got these Arrived on time In excellent condtion
"I bought this set of flatware to supplement what I already had, and couldn't be happier with my decision up to this point in time (1 week). For $30 or $40, you can't beat these. They aren't the nicest in the world, but if you follow the care directions, they don't rust, they look nice, and appear to be of decent quality. My only complaint is that they are a little light, but again, for $30 or $40, you can't beat em. I would recommend these for the budget conscious."
great product. needed to add to my set of lost pieces. I bought mine in 1995 in Canada. these are a little lighter and shiner but are the same style. happy with them
This is exactly what I wanted and expected!
Beauty to look at and feel. Super polished and shiny; good weight. It was a splurge for me to worth it. I'd buy again.
Beautiful as well as functional.
"I bought this service for 4 set to add to my service for 8 set that I received for Christmas. I love the look and feel of the Oneida Flight design. It is a good weight and size and I love the sleek, clean look. I use this set everyday and am very please with it."
perfect
I use these daily and like the look and feel. Not very heav but durable and hold up with repeated use. If needed would replace them with the same product.
"O'neida ""Steel"" flatware set is really stylish, well made, and comfortable. This a Great set for the price and quality. It's a Very nice set. This picture doesn't it do it much justice. It is Much shinier and made with good, quality steel."
Set matched perfectly with my previously bought set in 2010. Very sturdy flatware.
matches my other set except the knives are mildly different
Love the simple pattern.Dkes not distract from the plate. Simple but elegant
"Since we don't run the dishwasher every day, I needed to add another set of flatware to my original set in the same pattern. Now we don't have to hunt around for a fork or spoon. We have enough."
"Not exactly the same as my old set. It is also made cheaper. When you need extra, you have to buy something with the same design."
It fit my needs !!!
"Oneida. The only great company for silverware in the world. They make a good product, and they don't compromise on quality."
"Purchased this exact flatware set years ago and we liked it so much, we bought another set to replace the lost pieces. Very nice."
This is a staple item in the family that we have used for years.
"Exactly what I ordered for my daughter and her family. She needed to add to her place settings. Got it at a bargain, too! Thanks."
Very nice!
Good quality set.. I like that forks and spoons were medium to small sized.
Matches all my other silverware from 2o years ago. This style has not gone out of style.
"love this, it is great quality!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Bought this to match another set I got as a gift. Very happy with my purchase
"Flight Silverware. Reasonable price, well constructed."
"Added to our existing set, matched perfectly"
luv it
Good value as add-on / replacement to current flatware.
Needed to replace some flatware that disappeared from my kitchen. Oneida always has a quality product. Arrived as expected. Will order again and again.
good
This was part of a wedding gift and they love it
WORKS FINE.
Great product for the cost and quantity!
Got my money's worth
"Very nice, casual stainless."
Purchase to match what I already have. Oneida has always been quality.
"Perfect gift for first homeowners, college students. Simple, affordable and great quality."
:)
An outstanding buy and Amazon's fast delivery canast
Excellent!
Easy to hold.
This is a really nice set of flatware. It's solid so the spoons don't bend even with ice cream. And it has a nice simple design. It was also cheaper here than at the Onieda website. I would recommend this set and I use mine everyday.
No complaints
Great feeling flatware. You can't go wrong with Oneida. I will buy this again.
"The service is lovely, a joy to use. It does call for special care, though."
"I purchased a 20-piece set to add extra pieces to a set originally purchased in ~ 2005. Current pattern generally matches previous version-- the only difference you'll likely notice is that the shape of the gaps between the tines of the forks is slightly different (think of the point where your fingers meet your palm). As noted in other reviews, the metal is noticeable thinner than in previous version -- specifically at the butt end of forks and spoons. The heft isn't noticeably lighter, and your dinner guests aren't likely to take out a micrometer to measure metal gauge. However, the butt end does feel sharper -- guess the thinner metal didn't allow them to round off the edge. The knife handle is the same thickness as old version near the blade (~ 5/16""), but tapers down to ~ 3/16"" at the butt end. Set should still function and hold up well."
"Perfect weight and simple style, just what I was looking for."
Nice we need to add to our set of flatware and it was nice to find these the price was right and the process was easy
"My nonprofit is hosting an outdoor dinner and we could not face using plastic ware or flimsy wooden disposables, so we decided to get some inexpensive flatware. We only wanted one fork, one spoon (and one knife) per guest (120 in all) rather than the typical ""set"" of one knife with a large and small spoon and a large and small fork. Who needs all that for a BBQ? We also wanted them to be better than the ""flimsy"" quality you get in really cheap flatware. This flatware was perfect for us. They spoon is exactly what you need for soup or stew (or chili in our case), and the fork has nice long sturdy tongs for stabbing meat or salad. They are also a good medium weight that feel substantial in your hands. I would not buy them for everyday use in my home as I like a heavier weight and rounder feel in my hand, but then I paid $50 a place setting for my stainless steel flatware. Having said that, this flatware is just as nice as many of my friends have in their home. It is also a simple design that can be dressed up or down with your plates and decorations. I am sure it will last for years to come. Now, I just hope the knives I bought to go with them (from another vendor) are as good!"
Picks up food as you'd expect
My kids lost them after a short time so good value since I have to keep replacing
they are what they are and do what the are supposed to do
I love them so much I ordered another set
These are great! Not cheap made
"Good value, sturdy and comfortable design to hold in your hand"
Me encantaron
Very happy with this product
Everyday use
Very nice set
üëç
These are useful but I hate how the spoons are only big. I prefer the smaller ones.
Its nice quality but the spoon width is bigger than expected.
"I wanted to like it for it's sturdiness and seems good quality, but only 3 stars as I'm disappointed and should have trusted what other reviews have said. The edges are really sharp. I like how thick the forks and spoons are but not too comfy even when holding it as edges all around are SHARP. Not a happy camper here! See second pic in comparison to my decades old Oneida.. it's thinner but has smooth edges and really sturdy."
Spoons were longer handled (like a stirring spoon for tea). Not an American sized teaspoon. Also large spoon part.
okay for normal dinning.
"They look so cheap, very disappointed."
Great for the price
Especially when your kids use them for digging. Imagine sitting down family of 4 with 1 spoon and a 2 forks.
"I was skeptical about buying these after reading the reviews, but I figured I'd buy them anyway. I am so happy with my purchase. I LOVE these! I know it's just silverware but I really like them. Very sturdy and looks good on the table setting. Great value. I will order these again when my kids loose all of these."
Got these cause my kids loose spoons and forks like crazy! With the money
"Of all the vanishing replacement forks I have purchased on Amazon (96 in the last 10 years), these seem to be the highest quality.  Very heavy. Finished well, even between the tines. Probably impossible to bend. Very shiny.  Excellent choice"
"It is like you read my mind this was exactly what I was looking for a nice thin silverware lightweight nice looking clean and simple stainless steel I was so tired of seeing nothing but bulking ugly silverware ware the spoons were so thick it would push the food instead of sliding under so heavy it was like getting a workout while you were trying to eat. What a nice shine they are beautiful this is almost like stealing, buying at twenty dollars you do not know how hard I looked and how many I threw away I could not believe my eyes when I saw these almost afraid to open the box when I received them there is no way they're going to be as nice as they looked in the add. But they were so happy about how good they were."
"24 piece forks and spoons stainless steel silverware, food grade is as described. Good quality, sturdy, smooth and clean looking. Easy to hold. There may be a little con? The forks are slightly longer than usual and don't fit in the usual silverware drawer holding area but that is basically ok. I recommend this silverware."
"These forks and spoons are an excellent weight, not the inexpensive stuff that bends if you look at it sideways. Note, these spoons are not the small teaspoons you may have bought in the past. They are full sized soup spoons. Simple design and they hold up under daily use, highly recommend!"
"I was not expecting much for the price. All my utensils disappear, likely the result of them being thrown out by the kids. But this set is definitely not cheap. Heavy, very good quality utensils. I would definitely order again. Great product for a great price. Shipping was on time as well. No complaints."
"I ordered these because of other reviews, but I was still surprised at how much I liked them. The spoons are a perfect size, and the forks will actually stab your food. They have a nice weight and are comfortable to use. I wish I had these when my kids were growing up."
The forks and spoons have a nice weight to them don‚Äôt seem like they will bend easily (which is a plus when you have teenage boys in the house) You can‚Äôt beat the price bought these because for some reason spoons and forks and spoons can‚Äôt seem to last in my house (again teenage boys) Very satisfied with my purchase.
We needed just forks and spoons. We did not need any more knives. This was a great option to increase our stock of the silverware that seems to be missing the most.  The spoons and forks are great quality and the count was perfect too. I am glad I found these on Amazon.
"Good quality, simple but nice looking forks and knives. Easy for the kids to use as well as the adults. Wash well in the dishwasher and don‚Äôt get scratched and bent easily. A very good value for the money. I‚Äôm definitely happy with these forks and spoons."
"I needed more silverware for the holidays so I bought this package. I was surprised at how sturdy these items were. No funny taste from the metal, no bending and Beautiful shine. They also wash well by hand or dishwasher. I would definitely recommend."
"I love rounded spoon bowls, which is the primary reason I chose these, along with the price. The pieces have a nice length, are sturdy and a nice simple design that doesn't scream cheap, just simple/understated. Fully recommend!"
I was extremely satisfied with the simplicity and elegance of the set. I was constantly running short on flatware and needed a few items to lengthen my cleaning period. This set filled the gap beautifully.
"I was unsure if the quality on these would be as advertised, but they are nice and sturdy and feel great in your hand. I‚Äôm ordering another set today. Great forks and spoons, I don‚Äôt know where all my forks and spoons go! LOL"
"My spoons and forks are always disappearing, I don't know where they go. These are stylish and fit with my other flatware, so I'm quite pleased. Not heavy to hold, nor bulky they are quite pleasant to look at also. I am satisfied !"
I first bought the set for my co-workers. Everyone like them. I bought me a set for home. Thinking about purchasing another set as a back up. The only thing to remember is to not use any abrasive pads or sponges or it will scratch. I only use a towels to wash them and that keeps them from scratching.
"My silverware tends to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù over time. I‚Äôve purchased at least four sets over the years. This set is decent quality, looks nice on the table and a great price. I can always add to it if (when) needed."
"Better price point per piece than many, YET still well made and able to get the pieces we need (no one seems to lose the butter knives in our house for some reason)"
Getting bigger in family size so this set helped us solve the shortage problem. The look well made and don't see how they can rust.
"The ONLY thing I didn't like is the spoons. They are more of the size of tablespoons than teaspoons, which is what I wanted."
These utensils fit the hand and the mouth well. They are sturdy and at the same time delicate. I plan to purchase them again for myself and for a gift.
"I was skeptical at first because of some of the bad reviews but really I don‚Äôt know what they were talking about. These spoons are great quality. They are stainless steel, polished and pretty durable."
These were nicer than expected. I would recommend to purchase for every day flatware adorable shiny and not light weight We arevery satisfied with this purchase
I never been so happy to receive spoons and Forks. They was so beautifully shiny heavy. Not flimsy and dull great buy.
Very sturdy and well-made I have been used and put through the dishwasher 10+ time and still look brand new
"pleased with the price, size, quality Just received a couple of weeks ago, I‚Äôll try to update in 6 months how they hold up to constant dishwasher cleaning."
"They are shinny, sturdy yet attractive in a classy way. I think I really got my monies worth for a change!"
"forks and spoons kept vanishing... Bought this set to replace what was missing. No problems so far, nice quality."
"We were down to just a few forks and spoons. Where do they go? These replacements are great, seem well made and will last."
I was very pleased to receive these and how great and sturdy there are just the right sizes
"They are very solid metal, though it is a magnetic steel and thus will have a lower level of corrosion resistance.  The edges on the forks and spoons were quite sharp, like these will cut your mouth sharp. I've had to re-work every piece in some way to make them safe.  Really cheap, kinda wish they weren't offered for sale as they really are unsuitable for 99% of the people who buy them. I recommend staying away from these unless you don't mind having to refinish them yourself."
"Round ended spoons, doesn't bend when using force like poor quality silverware does. Awesome online find!"
"These forks and spoons are Great. Good weight. Not chintz. Good buy, for sure."
well made and super sturdy. Great for my rough family. They are really nice all around!
"Its heavy but not too heavy. It also doesnt have a bad taste like some do, I would recommend."
"Didn't dislike anything, and if you knew me that would be saying more than enough."
"I really really hate bad silverwear, these are super affordable and feel very nice in the hand, no sharp edges, they have some weight to them and I will definatly buy thme again when all of them miraculously go missing again..."
"perfect set for a low budget, detailed looks great, works great and best of all. the price!! def6would buy again if I need more."
"I was reading the reviews ahead of purchasing this set and I decided to take a chance. These are shiny, these are heavy, and these are big. These are great!"
"These are substantial utensils, and large. I am very pleased."
"Regular everyday use, but nice enough for ‚Äúcompany‚Äù. Good value for the money"
Utensils are very durable and good size.
Love this set! Came on time! Sturdy! No scratches yet and has went into dishwasher as well!!! Def worth it and affordable!! Great buy!! Recommend
Way better than the ones I already had in my drawer! Way better than stores and way better for the money!
"Nice finish, sturdy feel and good looks. Great forks and spoons."
Great quality and price
Worth the money
Excellent quality for the price
I bought this product for my small company and this is a great product for a great price.
Nice sturdy set especially for the price. Would definitely buy again
Very nice. Would buy again.
Good expensive fork's and spoons
I love these forks and spoons. They are sturdy and just to my taste. I like the simplicity. I need to buy some knives bow to match.
"Very nice to hold , having big hands!"
These are nice a sturdy and have a heavy feel to them . The quality is great and the shine lasts. Great set of silverware
Strong and the right size
Works as expected.
Love these! Guess I'm at that age where good silverware makes me super happy! Lol great value for the price. Beautiful and Come out spot free from the dishwasher!
I bought this to stock our small break room at work. The quality of these is really impressive for the money. Great value!
Very sturdy and look better than expected.
I liked the product
"Great silverware ,"
"they're very nice, glad i bought them, might buy more!!!"
Exactly as described
great product
Great price great density. Perfect
This is basic tableware for everyday use. Good product for the price.
It is hard to find a good silverwear set with just forks and spoons that are one size. Love these and they are very sturdy and don‚Äôt feel cheap
"I honestly was not expecting this to be as nice as it is, I was scared that the utensils would have sharp edges or they would bend easily, but they came and were perfect! 1 year update; I have now had these utensils for over a year and they have been put through the dishwasher around 100 times‚Ä¶. Buy them, do it right now, it will be the best decision in your life 10/10 would buy again"
"I got these for my first set of silverware that were truly my own-- not hand me down / mismatched dollar store items. This set is perfect for that purpose. At this price point, they exceed expectations. They are not THE MOST heavy / sturdy set you will ever own, but they definitely do not feel filmsy. The only time I worry about them at all is while scooping ice cream if it is still pretty frozen, but I need to just buy a real ice cream scooper for that.  They look very clean & sharp. They also fit nicely into the Amazon Basics silverware tray I purchased; I was worried that having 12 sets may overflow a bit but it's perfect."
"Took me a few months to write this review, because I wanted to make sure that the color stays the same and the shine does not disappear from the daily washes. This set of silverware is by far the best I have owned and all other sets were way more expensive. After 6 months of use, the shine is as good as when the set was brand new. I have washed them in the dishwasher and by hand and they look absolutely perfect. Would totally recommend."
"I‚Äôve been using this as every day silverware for a couple of months and I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. It has a great weight to it, washes well without signs of rust and looks great. You can‚Äôt find a better set for the money."
"Great value! These are priced VERY well, especially for all the pieces you get. I recommend them! UPDATE: 11/1/21 I UPDATED MY REVIEW TO 5 STARS!!! This set has stayed shiny, hasn't rusted & still looks great! I wash them in the dishwasher & all pieces have held up amazingly well. All pieces are the perfect weight & this is a great deal for all the pieces you get & for the quality!"
"I bought this set so I would FINALLY have a full matching set of silverware, like an adult. No more hodgepodge mismatch nonsense. It's a lovely set. Nice weight. Simple design. Shiny. I deducted 1 star because my set was missing one of the small spoons. This was super annoying because for some reason the small spoons are the ones that always disappear in this house, that I'm always replacing, and are always ending up in the garbage disposal. So I'm already starting with a man down."
"We decided to replace a bunch of mismatched silverware that we had accumulated over the years,,, it is certainly nice to now see nothing but matching silverware in the drawer and at place settings. We find the utensils very comfortable to hold and use. There were several reviews that claimed the knives rusted after several months. I think those may have been planted reviews, I shall definitely edit this review if indeed I see any rust in the future. The utensils are nice looking and solid feeling."
I love this silverware set ! I looked for two months for silverware I didn‚Äôt want to spend two or $300 but would have ‚Ä¶ I needed new silverware because for some reason spoons and forks always goes missing ! It‚Äôs a beautiful sad I‚Äôve had it for a couple of months I love the way they‚Äôre not too heavy and they‚Äôre definitely not to like the shape is perfect do not hesitate very very nice set BUY THEM NOW
Beautiful set very nice the package of the set was over the top with care. I mit just get another set because i love it that much. Feels strong in your hand. Well crafted set without going broke over sliverware.
"Needed a new set of eating ware and this well priced and met the needs for our event. Look is clean and functional. No issues with dishwasher, easily cleaned."
This was a gift to my daughter and family. She picked it out and has really liked the weight and all the silverware.
Very nice flatware at a great price. Don't hesitate!
This silverware set is absolutely beautiful and sturdy. I love how many pieces come in this set! The size of each fork and spoon are perfect too
"Love the product, nice and clean looking, good set, lots of utensils. They don't feel cheap."
"This set is definitely worth the money. It‚Äôs sturdy, washes well, and shiny. Great value!"
Perfect for my needs. Very sturdy & pretty for everyday occasions!
"I am thrilled with this set for being so inexpensive! They are a good quality, sturdy, and look beautiful. Looking forward to many years with them."
"I'm impressed with the weight, quality and workmanship. Great purchase!!"
I like this set for it will not bend like other silverware. Easy to hold for it does not have ridges or designs on it.
This is a great silverware set. It is a simple but elegant design. It is holding up well so far.
Sturdy set of silverware. Replaced an old set.
Good quality
Really nice Product for your Money!! Dishwasher safe!
Combination of silverware was very nice.
I love my new silverware. I also bought the bamboo silverware divider and my drawer looks so fancy. The silverware also comes with serving spoons and forks which I thought was a bonus.
Great quality!
This set was perfect. I live with my boyfriend and our roommate. And those two guys lose silverware all the time. I was hesitant to purchase this because I was afraid it would be cheap and crappy. But I was really impressed and how nice the set was and for such a great price. I‚Äôd actually be upset if they lost these as well. They don‚Äôt feel cheap at all. Well balanced. Looks pretty. I‚Äôve run them through the dishwasher and they still look great. Would recommend to anyone on a budget. And it was such a bonus to having the serving utensils as well.
"I bought these for my daughter and her husband. They LOVE them! Smooth, sturdy, easy to clean and very sleek looking!"
This is a thick and solid flatware set. Sleek and smooth. Very nice.
"Good quality, price and delivered as promised"
Water marks all over them after cleaning. I would avoid a shiny stainless next time. Edges are too hard. Don‚Äôt feel good in hand. Look nice out of the box. Cheap. But wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
Good trade
Worth the money
Good product. Heavy. Shape goes good with my square plates.
"The only thing I don't love is that the ends of the handles are square (pointed) so it's sometimes uncomfortable to grip them, especially when trying to eat something hard like ice cream. Otherwise, they're great!"
"the butter knives are kind of sharper than expected. My husband and daughter have both cut themselves on them (we have only had this set for a month); my husband while cooking and my teenager while washing dishes. The cuts were minor and stopped bleeding quickly enough, but I have found that the knives can be used to cut softer foods to include tender meats. I love this set and would buy it again. Just be aware that the knives aren‚Äôt something you‚Äôd let a young child have access to."
"Of ALL the silverware I‚Äôve purchased in my life, which is a LOT, these are by far my favorite. They‚Äôre super shiny (even straight out of the dishwasher) and they‚Äôre VERY strong and study! They‚Äôre definitely not junk or cheap! Therefore it‚Äôs also a great purchase for the price as well! Certainly recommend would definitely buy again, and will if/when I need to (as I have young children so we often have dishes going missing randomly over the years..)."
"Was running out of spoons and found myself at loss of where else to get silverware. Our walmart was burnt down by a horde of arsonists and I was left with no other choice but to purchase them online. They're so sturdy, cheap for what they are, and all you have to do is put them on high in the microwave to clean!! Never been so satisfied with an amazon purchase!"
"Love this silverware!! I've been looking for a nice, non-decorated set for some time. All I can ever find has designs on it. These have no lines or designs, they fit well in the hand, and are not to heavy or to light. And as the set comes with matching serving spoons and forks, you really get your money's worth. Will be buying a second set."
"Very nice everyday flatware, the only criticism I have is that the teaspoons are a bit too large.  Very comfortable in the hand."
This was a gift for my daughter. She likes the simple design and says the cutlery is easy to stack in the drawer. I have not used them but thought they seemed sturdy and look nice. The additional serving pieces made this set appealing.
"I was looking for a nice set of silverware that had more than eight pieces and didn't cost $$$. This fit perfectly. I love the stainless steel, sturdiness, and cost. After quite a few washings, it still looks new. I highly recommend!"
I needed a set of silverware for my RV. I didn't want to spend a ton because I didn't want to be upset if pieces got lost in our travels. I was impressed with the weight and quality of this set.
"I have a Oneida set that‚Äôs hard to get replaced. It would cost more than $120+ just to replace the same kind I have. So with that the case, I decided to find a replacement set for everyday use -and stumbled upon this product. It‚Äôs really inexpensive. Simple. And for the price, you can‚Äôt beat it."
"I was worried they would feel a bit cheaper given the price, but they're pretty good. I like the serving utensils in particular."
These are a MUCH higher quality than what you pay. I love them so much and makes such a difference in enjoying meals
"I purchased this item as a temporary set before I get a high quality one. When I opened it , I was surprised to see the item is of a high quality and every piece is wrapped carefully. Will recommend"
I just got them. I have washed them a few times. We will see if they rust. So far I really like them.
"They're not cheap looking at all .They're shinny, sturdy and you cannot beat the price at all. My husband says ""I like these set very much,"" nice"
"So worth the money! All pieces were in amazing shape, super clean look and have an expensive feel. Great value!"
I like cutlery that is sturdy and well balanced. This set is beautiful and also has a great feel in the hand. Perfect set for us!
These set is perfect for everyday use or an elegant sitting. My household is happy with purchase. I got two sets!
"It is good quality set but the lenght of the spoons/forks/knifes is shorter than usual, at least what I used to use. So returning. Check the length - if it is ok with you then it is a good buy for the money"
Good set thick heavy knives are sharp forks don't bend. Spoons are nice and thick big spoon are nice and big
"Great set. Would be even better if my spoon's wouldn't keep ""disappearing"""
Just the simple design I was looking for. Nice weight. Love that they have the serving pieces. Great price for the amount of silverware you get.
Nice looking and great value! Needed something lightweight but wanted it to be good quality. I found both in these.
"Good, sturdy set of silverware"
This set is great! I haven't ever owned a flatware set that was so decently priced and was such great quality. I would definitely suggest purchasing these if you are looking for new flatware.
"Cleans well in dishwasher, without rust or other markings. Looks nice with dinnerware."
I love my new silverware. It has been 6 months since I purchased them and I have had no issues. I have both hand washed and put into the dishwasher. I just moved into my new place and wanted a grownup set of silverware but didn't want to break the bank. For 66 pieces this was a real deal. Worth EVERY PENNY! :D
Good value for the price
Great quality for great price
I love this silverware. It has a sleek design and is very sturdy.
We really like this set. Sturdy and feels good in your hand. Worth the price for sure!
Just a great set of silverware at a great price!
Opted for a larger set because it seems like the spoons and forks always vanish in my house. I like how there are different sized forks and spoons. They do not feel cheap and it‚Äôs a sleek design.
nice set but after only a month we found one with rust on it...strange
Pleasantly surprised! Very nice set - and you can‚Äôt beat the price. I like the weight of each piece. Doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all.
My wife is happy with this set.
"It does look good to me. Just got it today and it looks clean&sturdy. I see so many silverware set on Amazon but with this price, i am satisfied. Will see how it goes with daily use."
"This silverware set is amazing! Needed something cheap and it‚Äôs perfect. Forewarning, the forks and spoons are bigger than normal ones. I really love that but just a heads up."
"This is a very nice cutlery for very little money. When the first set arrived, and I saw how nice it was, I immediately ordered a second set. The spoons are larger than I'm used to. The teaspoon is the size of my old soup spoon, and the soup spoons look like serving spoons to me. Hopefully I'll get used to this larger size. But overall, it's a very nice set. Very sleek."
Extremely satisfied. At first I thought some cheap steel set will be delivered. But surprisingly the quality is really good and knives are strong and overall I am satisfied. Thank you
"I bought this to supplement my cutlery when I entertained guests. Sturdy, nice looking. Great value for money"
"I've washed them twice and no sign of rust as reviewed on A LOT of other silverware sets on amazon. The regular size utensils seem a little oversize and the salad forks seemed a little small, but they work. I'm in a cabin and I had no silverware and was living on a set of plastic utensils. These are a grand step up. : )"
"We needed more silverware cause over the years we had lost or accidentally tossed most of the old pieces. This fit the bill, and we don't have to run the dishwasher as often."
"I love them it feel heavy duty, my daughter got it for Mother‚Äôs Day for me an I love them"
"This a very interesting set,sturdy and although none spensive it look very good look nice."
"Very good sturdy product for a low price, Im ordering more!"
Purchased this for a domestic violence shelter. Sturdy for lots of use and repeated washing.
Excellent sufficient all you need for your home eating utensils
Worth the money‚ù§Ô∏è
Comes with a small package yet has almost everything i need.
These are sturdier than expected.
I‚Äôll buy it again
Great came in great condition and clean great set would recommend
"I love these silverware, and the knives work amazing"
Sturdy for the price.
I needed some new kitchen utensils and these ones are absolutely perfect. My whole family is loving them.
Great product for the price!
It‚Äôs worth the money going to be using for a rental house. Very easy to hold could be a little bit more sturdy.
My old set needed replacement. This set looked similar and really liked steak knives
For everyday use I recommend highly.
Love the set
the value and price was on point ofr the set
Nothing came at 6 am
N/A
"For me, the most important aspect of silverware is its heft and weight. I like something substantial...but I also look for the economy. These 2 things are almost impossible to find together. I would classify this set as medium to light-medium in heft. It is better than Walmart stuff (which practically bends under normal use). For me, this is substantial enough to withstand normal to heavy use and the price is good. Well done."
I actually really like the silverware. It's solid and pretty nice but the steak knives catch when you try and cut and are crappy. I bought it for the silverware so I'm content.
"Nothing fancy, just a great deal on a good set of silverware. Bought a second set"
Great value. Lots of pieces. Sturdy. Great price
No rust...yet. Will definitely follow up if they do.  I've washed both by hand and in dishwasher on hot cycle. No problem!
For everyday use! Good deal for price!
Cheap but works for me
"The dinner spoons are too big, like serving spoon size. The dinner forks are also oddly big. The salad forks are super light and feel cheap! The butter knives feel light and look cheap as well. These are ok for college kids!n don‚Äôt buy for your house!"
WHY PUT A DECEPTIVE POCTURE SHOWING TONNS OF UTENSILS UNLESS YOU INTED TO LIE AND DECIEVE !! SUPER POOR QUALITY EVERYTHING THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT QUALITY EDGE POLISH ETC IS A FLAT BOLD LIE SHAMEFUL SHAME ON AMAZON!!!!
Spoons and forks are either too small or large.
Finish is coming off silverware. Especially forks. Looks tarnished. Will not buff off. Looks bad. Not recommending this product.
"The quantity is large, but the quality is really not good. Coarsely"
Very lightweight. Not sturdy. Bends easy.
There are no knife spoons and no Forks so what am I supposed to do it with a knife a steak knife
Product very cheap
"Nice weight and simple design, but edges weren't polished enough to keep them from being sharp. Hurts to use them."
I never received the forks only knives and spoons
This is a great set for the price. It‚Äôs cheaper than plastic disposable sets. The set is just your typical silverware. Nothing amazing. These are great for upcoming family BBQ.
The flatware are adequate for any use. They are filling I. Duty wise until my better set arrive But they work well now
What are kitchen needed more silverware. Strong and durable worth the price. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it.
Nice for the price dishwasher good
What I expected. 1-10 I say 7.5 to 8
This is great for anyone who lives alone on a budget. Love it!!
I love the silverware
Came as described. Better quality and sturdiness than what I was replacing. Would recommend.
These utensils are delicate and they do not hold up the bend easily
"Love these for the price, wash well not cheaply made. Great for the price!! I even bought 2 sets"
some minor imperfections but for the price you really cant complain. the steak knives are a plus. big fork and big spoon are larger than normal and small fork and small spoon are closer to regular size.
"That my silverware rusted after washing them in my dishwasher. I know it's too late to return the item ,but I hope they will make it right."
Not bad at all for quantity of 24 and quality super amazing ..recommend
Worth the price
This product is amazing for the price. I've been using them for around a month now and washing in the dishwasher - no chip or flakes or damage at all. Shipped quickly. I would buy it again.
I absolutely love love love these!!! My whole family does!!! The big spoons and forks are strong and solid for my husband while the smaller are just perfect and petite for me and my young son. when I host everyone has loved them!!! After I replaced my old set for these.... every time I open the draw it brings a smile to my face. Yes it‚Äôs the little things that me smile.... especially when I make the best decision on a purchase. These are a must buy will not regret set!!
I love this set!!! I‚Äôve been looking for the perfect silverware set with a knife that‚Äôs not too dull and I found it!!!! My daughter was making brownies and got the butter knife to scrape out the batter... long story short it sliced right through her finger and blood was everywhere!!! I was very impressed with the level of control you have with the knife and I‚Äôm mostly impressed on how well it cuts! gave this set 5 stars because they didn‚Äôt have a 10 star buttonüòÅüòÅüòÅ
"After just the first couple uses, we pulled the forks out of the dishwasher and noticed they were rusting between the prongs. We've tried our best to scrub but there is just no efficient way to remove it. This was not a fluke on one fork, it happened to all of them - both the small and large forks. They have the stainless steel stamp on them but clearly they are not stainless. We bought them in March but our move was delayed due to Covid-19 so they were in storage for a few months. We just started using them but now are past the return date. Very disappointed after reading good reviews on these."
"This is a great set of affordable silverware! My husband and I recently purchased a new home and wanted to finally have a matching silverware set for everyday dining and for formal dining. We both have large families so I purchased 2 of these sets (in case a spoon or fork goes missing, which we all know it will) and they great! The weight is very nice and the knives are actually decently sharp. We have used them in the dishwasher and have had no issues. This was an all-around great purchase!"
"Never have I heard of stainless steel ""rusting""; but the packaging on these (that we JUST received) specifically states:  *Wash in time after use against corrosion caused by residual salt or sauce. *Do not immerse flatware set in water for a long time for its durability. *Wipe flatware set dry immediately after wash, Store in cool dry places. *Do not use steel wool, scouring pads or sharp objects to avoid scratches.  I guess we'll see how they hold up! This got better reviews than most. Fingers crossed!"
I loved the clean lines as it can go with any dishwater pattern. Also it has a shine that is beautiful and has held after many uses and washings in my dishwasher. I got this set as a treat to myself as the flatware I had was all mismatched pieces I've had for many years. Some went back to wedding presents 55 years ago.
"I'd been looking for a long time for a new set of flatware for our house. I wanted a simple design, something with substance (not like some light-weight sets you see in big-box stores), something affordable, and a set that would work for at least 12 people/servings. THIS set hit all those marks!  My husband and teen/young adult boys all commented on how nice this set is and how much they like it, so it's not just me who likes the set.  I am thrilled to have found this set. The price is very affordable, and for the quality that you get, it's even better. I feel like this set is restaurant quality - heavy-duty and long lasting, and it looks good, too.  The pieces wash up very easily and you don't see water spots or finger prints, or anything like that on the stainless steel. Each piece feels good in your hands when you're using it - not too wide or too thin, just the perfect size and weight.  This set was packaged very well and is really a great quality! Very pleased with it and would highly recommended it to anyone!"
Very heavy duty silverware. I love the durability. They don‚Äôt bend back when scooping something hard. I am very impressed with the easy handling of these. I highly recommend.
"Last Christmas my mother in law gave us a new set of silverware. We replaced what we had, even though i loved the original set. My wife wanted a new set because over the years pieces parts went missing. The new set, that was a gift, was cheap looking, but worse was flimsy to the point that it was hard to cut anything due to the flex of the fork and inefficiency of the knives. I bought this set to give to my wife this Christmas and what an improvement, the appearance is shiny and quality looking, the weight of each piece is heavy, and all of the utensils are solid and sturdy. It is the difference of night and day. I would recommend this set to anyone. Every day my wife tells me how much she loves this set, primarily because of how cheap the old ones were."
"I needed to replace or augment my current tableware since my husband seems to have a problem separating garbage that goes in the trash can from tableware that goes in the dishwasher. We were down to two forks from our last set which I loved. This looked very similar to what I had and, as a service for 12, it may take my husband a little longer to ""lose"" all the forks. It is as described and the photos were accurate. It's not exactly like my last set but so close it would take someone a really close look and feel to figure it out. These feel good in the hand, are a good weight, and the serrated dinner knife is good enough to cut most meats easily. I love this!"
"Very happy. They've been used, sat in the sink dirty for a few hours, and run through the dishwasher for the past three weeks and they look great. Replaced old mismatched silverware set.  UPDATE: We originally purchased a 60-piece 2 years ago. A few forks have gone MIA since but the set has otherwise held up nicely. Purchased a 40-piece (for the same price we spent on the 60) just to increase our quantity. We can't even tell which are the 2-year-old ones or new ones. Besides the price difference, we are still super happy."
"Twelve place settings is awfully nice after losing a fork here; a knife there etc. over the years. We now have enough utensils to make it through, even with the used pieces in the DW. The set has a nice weight, comes out of the DW shiny/spotless & is more than nice-enough for everyday use. I also bought the matching add-on serving-pieces. All-in-all this is a pretty good deal for an attractive cutlery set that should last a good long time. Hope this helps."
"I‚Äôm honestly kind of shocked at how nice these are. I didn‚Äôt really read the reviews before I bought them and I didn‚Äôt look at any photos other than the main picture so I had no clue they would be so nice. I just saw the high review score, main picture, and they were a 60 piece set like I wanted. Gorgeous. They look like such high quality but they are rather light weight which is a nice change from traditional high quality silverware where they are a lot heavier. These shipped very quickly and my family loves them."
I bought This silverware set because my son had the exact same set and I loved it because it slips right into the little slots on the silverware caddy in the dishwasher !!! Comes out sparking clean!! It's a nice weight to to the silverware not too thin not too thick no rough edges all smooth... really nice set. Easy to hold definitely sturdy would buy again or recommend to a friend.
"Very nice look and less costly than other sets in stores of same quality. A little on the light side, but good for everyday use; I bought these for our camper and they are perfect-better than anticipated. Since it was just for camper use, I had looked around for an inexpensive set, and was left with really cheap, thin utensils that would bend easily or spending much more. These seem to be sturdy and look really nice. So glad I took the chance and went with them!"
I have been using this set for several months now and I love how they've held up. These are super affordable and look great on any table. I like the weight of each piece and they easily go into the dishwasher. I would definitely buy these again.
So far so good!! We have children so our flatware has thinned down in the years so it was time to order more. I like transitional & simple designs so this set was perfect. Very happy thus far. Thanks!
The pattern of silverware I had was recently discontinued so I needed to find something similar to what I already have. This set is exactly what I needed. I‚Äôve put it all through the dishwasher a few times and there are no imperfections. Very happy with the purchase.
"Recently purchased a beach rental unit and wanted to upgrade the look. I replaced all the flatware with half of this set, reserving the rest for the inevitable loss due to renters. They look great, and feel just right in the hand."
"These utensils are a lot stronger thn expected. The finish on them matches that of much more expensive sets. I really like the feel and sharpness of the knives as well. (They are butter knives but with sharp serrated edges.) All in all, I‚Äôd recommend to anyone and buy again."
"I have been looking for spoons that was simple, stylish, and not ornate. When I purchased these, I got all that I was looking for. The spoons sizes are a tad bit too big for my taste. I couldn‚Äôt discern the scale of the spoons from the pictures, but I would have preferred something smaller."
"These have a nice weight to them and are perfect for the family that loses silverware all the time. My kids & dad seem to toss mine all the time, so for the cost, I can keep replacing them!"
"Nothing fancy, but looks good on the table, feels good in your hand, and is very sturdy. Also, the knives have an excellent serrated edge that cuts food beautifully. We're very pleased with this item."
"they aren't the heaviest set, but the balance is good for me. the salad forks are a tad small, the knives are super sharp, they do sometimes get water spots but its nothing that you can't just rub off. great value. super happy"
Product came today. Unboxed and started washing. One of the big spoons has a big scratch in the back but the other silverware looked good. Watch out because the knives are actually sharp!
It was a gift and the person loved them. They were sturdy and nice and shiny. Seller shipped quickly. Would def buy again. Thank You!
"They look and feel sturdy. We have only used the dinner forks so far. Our previous forks kept disappearing, not by magic but due to carefree kids. Waiting until we remodel our kitchen to use all of the other items. but so far, I love the forks!!!"
I am very satisfied with this flatware. I wanted a stainless steel set that was sturdy and looked nice on the table. I was using a very old set that belonged to my parents and it was time for a change.
"Exactly what I wanted! I have been very picky when it has come to buying things for my first house and it took me a while to find a silverware set i loved the looks of but also worth the money. I have to say 100% worth the money! They are thick and feel sturdy, look exactly like the picture."
"I am so happy with this set of flatware. The quality is very nice. They are sturdy and look very expensive. So much better than my mismatched bent flatware I got rid of. The best part is there is service for 12 so even if some pieces go missing, I'll have service for 8."
"Super shocked at the quality for the price. These are heavy, solid utensils. I‚Äôd recommend to anyone. I‚Äôve washed them multiple times in the dishwasher and they come out perfect."
"Each piece individually wrapped and carefully packaged. All pieces in perfect condition. Excellent weight, easy to handle. Definitely recommend."
Nice looking set. Somehow we loose silverware like people loose socks. Happy to have a nice looking and sturdy set of (12 each) silverware.
"It's substantial, shiny, and reasonably priced."
Easy simple silverware with an Ergonomic curve grip üëç.
I really like this cutlery set! It‚Äôs very sleek and modern looking but it‚Äôs also quite sturdy and has kept its luster... it isn‚Äôt flimsy at all and is a great value!
"Great value, stainless, classic design I'll have this silverware until the day I die."
Good weight to silver ware.
This product far exceeded my expectations. The flatware's finish is of very high quality and its design is very appealing.
"I think it looks expensive for the price you actually pay! Total bang for your buck on this. I run mine in the dishwasher about every day, and they have yet to change at all. It all looks as perfect as the day I got them!"
My ratings are based on the price. For the price it‚Äôs a 5 across the board. If you compare to much higher priced flatware it‚Äôs a three. We ordered 2 sets because we had a huge family Christmas Eve party. Very nice and classy looking.
"Good quality, function, and style"
This set is a good looking good quality set. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase
This set is a very nice weight and looks good on the table. The bottom ends are a little sharp on the corners; I‚Äôm hoping that wears down some with use.
"Me gustaron mucho! son a muy buen precio , livianos y se ven muy bien en la mesa!"
"Very nice and sturdy set. Heavy duty, stainless steel. I love the look of the flat clean shaped ends. Very modern looking. Washes very well."
I like them very much. We got a camper and put my old set in there and this is my new set in the house. We have plenty of silverware now.
Sturdiness and durable. You will not be disappointed!
"I honestly can‚Äôt believe the price! I was nervous purchasing them online but he quality is stellar. It‚Äôs just a basic set, no design which is exactly what I wanted - perfect!"
I purchased this set about 2 months ago. They were very affordable so I expected a cheap quality item but they are very sturdy and look great. I have even had compliments on them.
"I was hesitant to buy these, as they were fairly inexpensive, but....... they are very good flatware, much better than the last set I had purchased. I would highly recommend these to anybody out there!"
Very well made and attractive
Received this in a reasonable time. Very attractive silverware. This was a gift and daughter loved it.
"I got tired of my old siler ware. I got this set because its durable, elegant looking and the knives are just as sharp as a steak knife."
great quality highly recommended
Just what I wanted. Not light and not too heavy.
"This set is a great everyday set and also can be used universally for a fancy tablescape. Heavy, durable, and washes up beautifully. I would order again."
These are simple but have a sleek modern design. The knives are quite sharp. I have a cut to prove it :)
Exactly what I wanted. They don't feel cheap. They are heavy duty and the butter knife is sharp enough to cut a steak.
Great deal for the price. Very attractive and comfortable to hold.
I waited too long to buy a matching set of silverware. These are exactly what I wanted and I finally have a matching set!
"These are a very nice quality, good weight, and seem to holding up nicely to daily use and dishwashing."
Was just as advertised and is a quality product.
This was much cheaper than many alternatives we were looking at and it is very good looking silverware. We've had it a couple months and its been used and washed several times. Still looks great.
This is a lovely set! It feels nice in your hand and there aren‚Äôt any sharp edges when you eat. Very pleased with the set.
This is a very good buy for the money. I love the simple style and it has a nice weight to it. Fast delivery and the customer service is excellent
My whole family really likes these. Beautiful and well-balanced.
What exactly what I was looking for. Elegant and classy yet practical for everyday use.
"I was pleasantly surprised with this silverware. It is high quality, beautiful and sturdy. Excellent value."
I was worried that this set wouldn't hold up just because of the cost but I bought them anyway just so I could pitch my 15 year old set of mixmatched flatware. One month in I'm happy with the purchase and have 0 complaints.
Video Player is loading.
I've been using these for well over a month and have no complaints at all as far as quality. However the upward curve at the end of the forks causes them to slide inwards on my plates. So I often find the handle in my pancake syrup or spaghetti sauce. I'm now learning to flip the forks over to avoid that.
"I just wanted my 94 year old grandma to have a matching set. My family takes care of her and everyone loves using this new silverware. We had to buy a set of 12 to splits between 2 other relatives. Lol  Con: I prefer a more rounded edge on handle, so I would buy a different version, but the quality was great and worth every penny."
"The Forks have very thin, tapered prongs. When I was unpacking them, I was stabbed by the Forks numerous times, drawing blood. I decided to return the product and get a different brand."
"Could not believe the quality of this set; especially for the price! Sturdy, simple, elegant!"
The smaller forks are comically small.
Bought these and they look and work great. Good quality and excellent value
"It seem sturdy and easy to clean the knife though looks and feels odd, its not the knife that i wouldnt use all the time"
Sturdiness
Truly love my set it‚Äôs everything I asked for
Tama√±o y calidad
glad I got these. i use it for my new Apartment. plus it feel like I never have enough silverware.
The set is nice but I'm missing one large fork.
"This product is just as described on the website. Great quality, had to order a second set. Thanks so much, I love my silverware set!üëçüèº"
We live the silverware. It is of very good quality.
I bought this as a gift for an elderly family member. They absolutely loved it and continue to rave about what a nice set this is.
"Vert nice to grip and easy to clean my guest also love them , nice heavy duty but light when holding to use. on a scale of 1 to 10 it is a 10"
I love these. No frill but really sturdy and perfect size. Quality is nice! Great every day use. You can even dip ice cream without bending.
I like that my package was delivered early. This is a nice set.
"While looking (on a whim) to buy a budget set of everyday flatware, all I could focus on were my past experiences. From odd shapes, to material so thin you don‚Äôt need to be a magician to bend them with your mind, to pieces that seem to begin rusting before they‚Äôre even used. And they‚Äôre ugly,  This set is a must have. It‚Äôs the opposite of every cheap set we‚Äôve ever used. These pieces are not covered in ugly designs, they‚Äôre heavy and feel good in your hand, they do their job well, and I‚Äôve had mine quite a while and they still look as good as they did when I bought them. And their simple, clean design means they‚Äôll fit in with anything, fancy or everyday. I‚Äôd happily use them for any event, from buttering toast alone in the morning to Christmas dinner. (In fact, I have a very expensive set of flatware, and not only is it difficult to keep clean, it‚Äôs not holding up well either).  The sheer amount of pieces in this set for the price is another jewel in their crown.  I would recommend this set to everyone. You will not be disappointed. In fact, I‚Äôm tempted to only use this set from now on. Five stars easily"
They have a nice weight. I over indexed on exactly how hefty did they feel in the hand. After a minute or two I couldn't tell even when comparing to my current silverware. So I got out the scale. The weights are: Dinner fork 2 oz Serving spoon: 2.5 oz Knife 3.3 oz Spoon 1.4 Dessert fork 1.3 Heavier than my current fancy dinner set.
"My family is always losing spoons and forks for some reason ..... I am convinced the kids throw them out when they clean their dishes ..... for some time I have been buying replacements at the open stock in Bath and Body .....since I got some Xmas money I decided to replace with a complete set and came across this set on Amazon .... I was hesitant to buy it because I i like to feel how the utensils feel in your hand ......Surprisingly, this set is almost identical to the open stock I was buying ....they have some weight but are not too heavy and for the price point I think they are an excellent value.....I was able to get an entire set for less then I would have bought ( and only spoons and forks) So I am very pleased !!!!!"
"Did a lot of research trying to find the right set of flatware cutlery before settling on these. Couldn't be happier. Promptly delivered as promised. They are easy to handle, well balanced and are easy to clean. Very happy with them and wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
I love the weight of these! Some utensils I have used in the past have scratched easily. But not this! These are high-quality for sure.
"These are solid. I like having flatware that has a little heft to it and these fit the bill. The mirror finish is excellent as well. Even if they get a water spot, a quick swipe with a towel and they are gone.  This is an excellent product, at a good price."
"Extremely happy I decided to purchase this silverware set despite a couple reviews of tarnishing/rusting... we have had no issues at all and have washed these DOZENS of times! They are a nice weight, not flimsy, look gorgeous, easy to hold, sleek, and extremely easily to clean by popping them into the dishwasher. We are beyond satisfied !"
"Proper weight and balance. Smooth and comfortable grips with all the eating surfaces also smooth and without sharp edges or burrs. The knives are SHARP! Not a dull butter knife, so take care! I did actually cut myself before I realized how sharp they were. So sharp I didn‚Äôt feel the initial cut. The design is plain, but easily will blend with other designs and serving pieces. I‚Äôm rather difficult to please when it comes to cutlery. This set pleases me, and at an astounding price point. I‚Äôll be purchasing another set. Highly recommend."
These are lovely. As advertized the silverware is heavy.
"They have a nice shine to them. I have them for a few months now and they are easy to clean, no scratches and dress up any table. Be it everyday or special occasion! I highly recommend for quality, looks, and price for a nice weight utensils."
I normally would go with the cheapest option when comes to silverware but I read the great reviews and wanted to see what I was missing out on. This set is beautiful and you can feel the high level of quality as soon as you hold each piece. I find myself trying to use them delicately because I don't want to ruin the nearly immaculate finish and shine. You won't regret this purchase.
"My grandson just bought a new house and so I gave him this ""silverware"" as a house warming gift. He said it was just the kind a flatware he liked, especially the heaviness. He is a big man at 6'3"" and 200 plus pounds so he likes things that match his statue. Also, he commented on just how well polished this flatware is. If he likes it, then I did good."
"My husband told me specifically that he wanted tableware with some weight to it. These have a good weight and balance to them, and they always come out spotless from the dishwasher. Can stab a spoon into the hardest frozen ice cream pint and it won‚Äôt bend. 10/10 highly recommend"
"Great stuff. Had been using my parents old, old REAL silverware but it was getting worn and I could not put it in the dishwasher because of tarnishing. Decided to bite the bullet and buy this item. Saves lots of time, no longer need to handwash silverware, and is very elegant. Delighted with the purchase"
"Could not have made a better choice. Extremely well made, eye-catching; when the drawer is opened, the mirror finish reflects like it's a drawer full of silver. Easy to handle, though having some weight. Wish I'd found this flatware long ago; it is, as they say, definitely a keeper!"
"I have had my set for over a month now and absolutely LOVE them. They are a good weight and feel amazing! I am not just saying that - they really do feel great - very smooth. I have washed them in the dishwasher at least 25 times and they come out as shining as the day we got them.  Very well made, great weight, looks stylish and feels good when using.  I Absolutely Recommend!"
"Decided to get a matching set of daily use flatware with enough pieces for the kids to come visit. These are heavier than our other mismatched sets, which feels nice in the hand. Feel substantial, not like they will bend."
Heavy Great price Comfy in hand Not sure why people saying salad fork like toddler size. Yes smaller but perfect for desserts. Out of entire set 2 pieces had tiny marks on them but not bad. Washed upon arrival. Looked nice and shiny afterwards
"These are heavy, so heavy my drawer is feeling the weight. These are pretty and functional. I would imagine they will be my last set to buy."
"Seriously! For the price, this is the set to purchase. I purchased three different sets and sent them back due to low quality, before I found 'HaWare' Premium Grade Stainless Steel Flatware. Very sturdy, heavy, comfortable grip, and higher quality than I see in local fancy restaurants. You will never need to buy another flatware set."
"This is the 3rd flatware set i've bought in 2 weeks...others- at same price were ""tinney, dull, & ""in person"", kinda junky! These were so much more substantial looking, great shine, great weight! Very happy with this choice!"
"Surprised by how good the quality is! Chose this set specifically for their minimalist design and the fact that the forks are fully finished between the prongs, so no risk of people cutting themselves. All the cutlery has a substantial weight and no defects. Easy to hold & SUPER easy to clean, the smooth finish helps food come right off and gives the set a polished look.  The wording on packaging had some misspellings & wasn‚Äôt in proper English so I was worried I had just purchased junk‚Ä¶ however the product is great and the items were are packaged very thoughtfully & carefully to maintain integrity of items while in transit."
This is the 2nd set I have bought. We are hosting Christmas this year and needed the extra pieces. Very happy with these overall. They have a good weight to them. Very simple but I find very pleasing design. Very easy to clean and have been very durable.
"They feel good in your hand. Well balanced and so far no rust from the dishwasher. Had a hammerd set cost 3 times the amount and had nothing but problems. The knives rusted so sent them back to the company, sent me back new knives. Guess what they rusted too"
"This silverware set looks and feels great. Beautiful to look at & feels comfortable in your hand. The larger spoons in the set are pretty big but being a soup spoon that is to be expected. Overall, great purchase on a budget..."
"Higher quality than anticipated , which is very good. Pleasantly surprised. Large spoon is heavy and can fall. Need to balance it.The knives are not sharp, so you may still need steak knives. Forks are good quality and heavy enough not to bend like some do. Very positive recommendation. This set even be used as fine cutlery."
"Great value - quite sturdy. Affordable enough where when your kids lose a spoon, it's not the end of the world, but I expect the flatware will last quite a long time."
"Wow, just wow! I never thought silverware would make me so happy üòÇ they are extremely sturdy and so affordable for the amount of silverware you get!"
"They look even better than pictured! Nice hand feel, good weight."
"I have bought several sets of silverware over the years and something was always missing. I ordered these and I am so happy. The design and weight are ""classic"" This set will last for many years!!!"
Well made and nicely polished set. We have been using them daily for several weeks and can find nothing to dislike. The pieces are almost identical to and of the same quality as a set we paid more than twice as much for. The nice smooth finish makes them easy to clean.
This is a beautiful set of silverware!! I'm so glad I ordered it. I would highly recommend this set!!
""
"It was a gamble buying silverware online, definitely something I'd prefer to feel before purchasing but these are great. They have that undeniable ""heft"" that you expect from, say, a nice restaurant. Not redundantly heavy, just enough to make you do the little up and down movement with your hand and think ""hm, these are nice..."".  Otherwise, your basic stainless steel, medium shine utensils."
I'm very pleased with this set - the design is timeless and simple and the weight/heft of each piece makes the flatware 'substantial' and not feeling cheap.
"Super nice and HEAVY!! I absolutely love this set!!! Looks and feels expensive. I've washed in the dishwasher several times now, no problems."
"Shiny, heavy and beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è.. my wife loves the heft and look of this tableware!"
Very nice set of heavy duty flatware. Great weight distribution top to bottom. Haven‚Äôt washed them yet but will follow-up on this review if needed. Super smooth edges and shiny finish. Impressive sized spoons; large and larger :)
"This is a very nice, quality set of dinnerware for a very reasonable price. We love it for everyday use."
I was really shocked at the quality of this set considering it serves 8! If I went to a store it would of been twice the price! It‚Äôs heavy and sturdy and definitely doesn‚Äôt have sharp edges like the cheap ones!! Money well spent for an extra set of silverware
"Great looking with mirror-like shine. Nice weight, feels great in the hand, with large spoon surface (2 sizes on spoons). Knives are serrated so work well cutting meat. Price good value considering high quality of the flatware. Very pleased with purchase."
This silverware is sleek and simple. I really like the look. The only surprise was how small the salad fork was! Its cute but much smaller that other sets I own. It'll be great for young children though. My only complaint is trying to figure out why the stainless steel comes out of the dishwasher with dark marks. I always rinse everything off so I'm not sure how this is happening. I've tried hard to get it off but that's been a challenge. Not all pieces have been affected and that makes it more confusing. Overall I love the simplicity of the silverware!
"My flatware was disappearing a piece at a time, and I needed a complete set. This is beautiful and we like it."
This flatware is beautiful - simple clean lines without being plain. It will work with almost any style of dinnerware. It has substantial weight and is easy to hold. Highly recommend.
"Great, quality silverware set & awesome price!! Happy customer here!! Thx!"
Great set. Heavy enough to feel substantial and quality but not too heavy that you can‚Äôt use daily and casually. I love the look and style can lend itself to a family dinner or a nice fancy holiday meal.
"I am very pleased with my set of flatware. It is very plain, yet elegant. And the price is very reasonable. You‚Äôll enjoy using this flatware."
"So, after reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical. The forks are not toddler size. All the silverware is pretty, sturdy and fits great in my hand. This is the first silverware set I've ever bought myself. You won't be disappointed."
"We love heavy silverware. This set was exactly what we were looking for, and the cost was extremely reasonable."
As you know there are.so many different products to choose from. This was a good choice at a fair price.
"I was pleasantly surprised by the workmanship of this flatware. Heavy without being bulky, smooth mirror finish that has held up well in the dishwasher, and the design is very minimalist which I like. Overall, very pleased with this purchase."
Nothing to dislike about this item! They shine beautifully. Very classy! Made to last a lifetime Nobody is going to bend these! My pet peeve is using bent forks!!!
"This is the perfect flatware for everyday use. Elegant looking, heavy duty, and sturdy! I‚Äôm am very impressed with this purchase. Would definitely recommend this Item!!!"
"These have such a nice weight to them. Not too heavy where it's annoying to hold but sturdy enough so you KNOW they aren't bending. I've been using them for a month or two now. No issues in the dishwasher so far. They look like they would cost more than they do. For the price, this is a steal."
"Bought the set and was very impressed with the quality, very heavy duty yet nice to hold . SoI decided to hit the buy again feature to be certain that I would get the same set . At first it appeared to be the same but after they got mixed up a bit it was very apparent that the sets do not match at all , the width,and the bend are very different. Both sets are fine in quality but do not match , rather disappointed."
Very nice set. Looks and feels good. Simple design but very pretty.
I have used it for a couple of weeks now and it stands up well in the dishwasher. Love it!
"Just what I wanted strong ,quality silverware"
"I love that these were sturdy, real silver. Not cheap and much bigger than the cheaper fake silverware. Worth the purchase!"
"Attractive, durable, perfect size & weight. Best I have ever used."
"This silverware set is made of great quality. It's SS, durable and nice shiny silver to it. Arrived on time. I bought the 60 pcs set."
"I love my new silverware. I recommend these to anyone looking for thick, sturdy silverware. Great Price, Fast Shipping. 100% recommend."
These were perfect for everyday use. They look great and have a nice weight to them.
These are really heavy duty. I could probably scoop ice cream with the spoons instead of using an ice cream scoop. I bought them for the office kitchen band everyone loves them.
"The product is well made, the silverware is easy to hold and they are very well designed."
Like the way it looks and balance perfectly
I was wary of purchasing online since I was most concerned with the heft of the flatware. I was not disappointed; they are elegant and streamlined and are the perfect weight.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with the silverware set . Dress it up or dress it down. It has a good weight to it and the knife cuts easily.
This set is very sturdy and attractive
Nice product has weight to them
"I have a tableware story to share at the end of my review, so too keep from boring those who don‚Äôt care to read that, I‚Äôll start with the technical.  This set is fabulous. I have zero regrets in choosing it, and while I DO NOT LOVE EVERYTHING about it, it‚Äôs the best set on the market for me, based upon the factors of price, availability, function, looks, and feel. A few reviewers have complained they hated the small spoons and small forks. I disagree on the spoons, they are just fine. I agree on the small forks, but with a caveat ‚Äì what occasions will you prefer a small fork to a large one? For me, it‚Äôs always for desserts alone, or any time I want to eat slowly on something decadent and calorie dense. In this regard, the micro-fork is adequate to the task, and in some ways, better than I would have chosen for myself. This set is super heavy duty. Check out my very detailed photos and measurements. Weigh your current set and compare the weights I have shown here. I think you‚Äôll agree, this set is beyond the quality you will use even at the finest restaurants, where they have chosen tableware nicer than is found in most modern homes. BONUS: I was not expecting to see the hammered finish on the backs of every piece, just the knives. This makes the set even more beautiful and comfortable to hold. I was very pleasantly surprised.  Now, on to my story‚Ä¶  My parents were baby boomers, both now departed before their time. Their first set of tableware was US Navy surplus. Amazingly strong but very plain. Their second set was garbage, a thin 60‚Äôs style that bent and was uncomfortable to hold. The set had narrow handles, like wayyyyy too narrow. You could use the handle end of any spoon or fork and stab it through your hand if you weren‚Äôt careful. Something like the micro men‚Äôs ties that were also popular at the time. Less is not always more. Anyway, after realizing the mistake and being more financially secure, my mother opted for this elegant but rather lightweight dot-border set you see in my photos. I grew up with this set, it was around since I was a baby. A few of the spoons and forks were retained from that awful 60‚Äôs set, so I had them to compare and appreciated we had this much nicer set to use. It was 8 dinner forks, 8 dessert forks, 8 knives, 8 table spoons, 16 teaspoons, and 8 long-handled drink spoons. That last one still amazes me, it‚Äôs perhaps a ‚Äò70s thing long since forgotten. I don‚Äôt have occasion to stir sugar into my tall drinks, but do find these useful for the tall yogurt containers when it‚Äôs down to the last little bit, or those sauce jars where you don‚Äôt want to mess your fingers as you fight for the last little remnants. As this set was not restaurant grade heavy duty by any means, my mother augmented the collection by purchasing a couple of open stock VERY heavy forks, to mash tuna, egg salad, and other kitchen prep tasks that required more strength than the main set could provide. I‚Äôve kept those and collected a motley crew of other forks over the years, to make sure there are enough between dishwasher loads. I don‚Äôt like mismatched sets of tableware, and have endured this scourge of outlier dinner forks for years.  In the 80‚Äôs, my mother realized she always wanted floral tableware, and had denied herself the pleasure in a household of otherwise all male persons. My brother had already gone off to university by this time, I thought the new set was a bad move, but it was not my decision to make. The floral pattern had a pointy tip at the end of all the fork/spoon handles, and the dessert forks had an ornate single tine on the right side that always made them look like decorative pitchforks to me. I asked and was granted custody of this outgoing set, and have used it up until this week, a full 35 years plus those early years growing up. This set has been in my life for all my 47 years. I wasn‚Äôt going to part with it on a whim. Only one of the teaspoons got destroyed in the sink disposer (it was probably my fault as a kid), and not a single piece was ever lost. These even traveled to the Netherlands and back, for my 5 years living there. That‚Äôs dedication.  After years of observing what I like and don‚Äôt, my criteria for a proper set is this: Smooth on front, edges, and back, no pointy handle ends, heavy weight, no oddball shapes for any pieces, no florals, nothing gold, nothing with inlays or satin finishes, nothing ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù looking. I love modern, functional, and aesthetically pleasing tableware. Why did I need new tableware after so many years of service from my current set? Simply this: I‚Äôve changed the way I eat. I do not eat at restaurants unless I travel or am dragged off to one. I‚Äôm a home chef, vegetarian, and recently extremely health conscious. I eat 6 smaller meals a day now instead of, as in my youth, gluttonizing at a buffet once a day, sitting around in pain and distress for 90 minutes afterward. In college, I ate stupid amounts of pizza buffets. Then I moved to Las Vegas for 10 years and indulged constantly at every buffet in town. At my worst, I weighed 288lbs. I now weigh 175. I eat Greek yogurt at least once a day, sometimes twice. I go through a lot of spoons in a week‚Ä¶ too many spoons for my old set to keep up. I hate conserving spoons, rinsing them off and setting them on the counter to use again and again and again. That got old.  Summary: this set is everything I have always wanted and did not think to take the time to find. My journey began 2 days ago at that coupon obsessed shop that *rhymes with bowls*, pouring over all their patterns thinking about chasing a deal. Then I noticed with a quick search of the Oneida Icarus pattern (the only one they had that met all my basic criteria, but was sadly quite plain and boring to behold), that even with all the discounts games I could muster, it was still cheaper both on Amazon and across the street at BB&B. That had me researching more deeply, the metals used in modern tableware ‚Äì and I decided I must have 18/8 or 18/10, thick, smooth, and hammered!!! Yes, hammered was the art on a spoon I‚Äôd been missing in my life. I love scales and how they look, reptiles are a big part of my life. Hammered reminds me of snake skin, and I love that. It‚Äôs art, and I love it. In the end, I bought a 24 piece set, 3 full boxes of 40, for 30% less than I was going to pay at that quasi-department store for a style I didn‚Äôt even like that much. And I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to bother shopping at high end department stores, I didn‚Äôt need to blow a grand on tableware that looks like it was chosen by my grandmother.  Epilogue (and details about my photos): The US Navy surplus spoon is a classic egg shape bowl, as is my dot edge set. The DANIALLI set has a modern oval for both spoon sizes, and both spoons are notably longer than typical sets, especially the tablespoon. The 8 inch length of the tablespoon replaces the need for the long lost long handled drink spoons from my 70‚Äôs set. Weight on all pieces is over double my current set, and none but the knife blades or tiny forks could be bent with normal effort, by a normal hand without tools or leverage being employed. Simply put, you won‚Äôt accidentally bend any of these pieces, as was common with my old set. If you want to put a lot of force down on a fork to mash something like nuts or canned tuna, it won‚Äôt deform. I like that a lot. If you‚Äôre eating angry, you won‚Äôt bend a spoon, but you might break a bowl."
"I promised myself I wasn't gonna do a long review so...This set is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!! I'm gonna get straight to the nitty gritty.. I read so many reviews of other companies trying to find a less expensive set...because honestly I've never really paid for any real dining cutlery I've always grab the cheap stuff from a Big Lots or a Family Dollar you know $10 to $20 bucks tops.. But I've gotten lil older and really was trying to find something with more quality and I was so pleased with the decision I made, this is an excellent set that has the hammered look on both sides of the silverware it is solid and not cheap each piece came in it own individualized sleeve it was packaged to perfection with a beautiful box and product card. I had never heard of Danailli but this will be a product that will be in my household as long as they continue to provide this level of product and class! I'm all for it.... Just stop looking through hundreds of other reviews about rusted sets and people returning there crap because there product was chipped right out the box. Enough is enough.. This is The One!!"
"This is, by far, the best silverware I have ever owned! Very sturdy, cleans up easily, and looks AMAZING on the table! Get compliments all the time! HIGH quality, very shiny and extremely beautiful! Cannot say enough about this set. LOVE it...would purchase it for a gift, for a friend, for a family member. If I owned a restaurant, this is the silverware I would use for my guests!"
"I'm 75 years old. I've always bought mid-grade silverware and decided to buy quality this time. I was not disappointed. First of all the packaging was beautiful. Strong sturdy box with an inner cardboard liner. Inside each piece of cutlery was bagged and grouped and wrapped with bubblewrap., With the impressive packaging this would make lovely wedding gift. The silverware I chose is beautifully polished and the hammered handles are a perfect fit for my hand. They are nicely weighted. Worth every penny. I bought 2 sets. I had not idea where they were manufactured and I was hopeful they were not made in China. They were made in fact Vietnam. The maufacturers' should be extremely proud of the workmanship and Danialli should be proud of the design! Thank you - I look forward to serving my family with these utensils!"
"Best purchase I have ever made! And I am a BIG amazon prime shopper. Don‚Äôt listen to bad reviews. Seriously if you want nice, heavy quality and not flimsy silverware buy those!!! Those are real one. Great value for the price. Only bought for 4 people but I will definitely buy another set. The size of the spoons and the forks are PERFECT! No problem with putting them in dishwasher as well. Even my husband was very impressed!! So happy to be using those every day! We are tall and strong people and if you know what I mean, using flat design silverware actually hurts your hand when cuttinb something and I hated it. Those are the best thing EVER! Best quality!"
"New home, new silverware! Tossed the old stuff I'd bought as a temporary fix (dollar store crap that rusted after a few runs through the dishwasher), got these and a beautiful bamboo drawer organizer that was always too big for the drawers in my old house. I love these!  Update 12/28/20: Holy cow, do I love this silverware! Just ordered 2 more sets of salad forks and teaspoons to go with the gaggle of butter knives that came with the original service. Just those 2 pieces weren't available by themselves every time I checked, until today! YAY!!!  I have permanent nerve damage in my dominant arm from a car accident 8 years ago and the smooth, rounded edges of this service is extremely comfortable in my hyper-sensitive hand."
"So‚Ä¶follow up from approximately 3 weeks ago when I received this silverware that we thought was AMAZING!!! After paying $178.00 for 8 piece setting; it being ‚Äúdishwasher safe‚Äù, I took a butter knife out of the drawer & if you look closely, there is already rust on it!!! I am so disappointed & would appreciate the company reaching out to me. My 30+ year old silverware we had, which was much cheaper, lasted so long and MAYBE 20% the price! New rating would be a 2 due to it being 18 10 graded when there is no way that is the quality of silverware that we received."
"I was being very fussy when I picked these out to the point that I was worried I would never like anything I picked... but these are perfect. I wanted something which character, but not over the top and I think these fit the bill. The shapes are unique, but not weird. The hammered texture gives them nice character and go with a variety of dishes. They are very pretty, have the right size and weight, and seem like they should be very durable. I haven't had them long enough to confirm that, but they are 18/10 which is very important"
"I bought the silverware with the hammered design to replace my crocodile design. Somehow my forks walk away on their tines! These are a beautiful replacement and actually mix very well with my crocodile set, which is no longer made. On the back of each set, is a small mark by the manufacturer. It's a small detail, but that small mark signifies quality design, materials, and craftsmanship. These are sturdy pieces that won't bend. They are beautifully weighted and feel great in the hand. They still shine and sparkle after a zip through the dishwasher."
"We had a great experience before with Danialli 20 piece sleek flatware, we needed to upgrade and it was the best decision to buy this elegant hammered design. As expected the set is very easy to hold, is durable and the weight is perfect. We use every piece for dining and it couldn‚Äôt be more useful for all kind of cuisine. The sizes are very well designed, the larger ones are the exact large we look for and the smaller ones are the right fit too."
"I wasn‚Äôt here in the dishwasher. No rust. No loss of shine. Still just as beautiful as when they arrived. Great weight for our family. The butter knife is solid. Heavier than the rest, but definitely well made for the price."
"I spent alot of time reading reviews on durability, people's likes/dislikes etc. For me, purchasing silverware took as much research as purchasing a kitchen appliance lol. I finally decided on the hammered design and it is beautiful, durable, and I have no regrets. I am a 'everything goes in the dishwasher"" person, so this silverware gets no special treatment. The big forks were a great size, I liked that they were narrowed more than my old 15 yr Walmart set. The small forks are perfect for dessert. I like the rounded top knife for P&J. Overall, I am very pleased with my decision and set after 1 month."
"I love this silverware! I bought the hammered type. Very shiny and beautiful! The dinner fork and spoon might look too long, but when you use them, they balance in your hand perfectly. In other words, the pieces have a nice ‚Äòheft‚Äô to them. One thing I wasn‚Äôt expecting and this may sound a little weird, but the finish is so smooth that the pieces slide easily out of your mouth. It was a pleasant feeling and added to my enjoyment of my meal. The teaspoons and dessert forks are a little larger than standard, which is nice because they easily substitute for the dinner spoon or fork. Which is really nice since the dessert forks on my other set where too small and I rarely used them. I can‚Äôt wait to show them off! Definitely worth the price. I bought a 8 place setting."
"I ordered my first set a while back and just had to get a second. I also the serving set as well. The setting looks so good on the table and love the hammered look, the weight and sturdiness. Some silverware is so thin and not comfortable to hold while eating and not to mention bends easily. Not the Danialli, highly recommend."
These utensils are AMAZING!!! They are a little pricey I bought a set of 20 for $60 something. When I came back to buy another 20 piece the price had jumped up to $90 so hopefully it goes back down some so I can get my other set. These are sturdy as all get out!!! They are on the heavy side so if you don't want heavy utensils so not get these. I will buy again and I recommend highly!!!
Bought the sleek service for 12. True to the new sizing- not too heavy but sturdy. So far we‚Äôre really enjoying this set! Been through the dishwasher many times already- no sign of wear.
"This set is better than I expected! I love the thickness of the handles because they feel sturdy and virtually indestructible while also managing to look sophisticated. I especially like the shape of the spoons because they are slightly elongated and smooth. Some spoons are too round and have thinner edges that feel rough, but these are perfect. Overall 10/10 would recommend!"
"The Danielle flatware is JUST what I was looking for to replace my old set (for which I couldn't find replacements). I love the weight of the pieces and the hammered finish. The handle curve fits beautifully into my hand. I might wish the the teaspoon was a half inch (12mm) longer, but am generally very satisfied with the craftsmanship."
"We got the Modern Fidenza Hammered Flatware and it is exquisite! It comes nicely packaged, it's well made / very sturdy and looks absolutely gorgeous ~ see pics for yourself. We've had it about a month now and it cleans up just like the first day we got it without any surface scratches. Hoping that continues to be the case. We couldn't be happier with this purchase!!"
"The product was shipped quickly, and arrived in a classy box. Very pretty and seem to be of high quality. I checked with a magnet and some of the large items had enough regular steel to attach. Regardless, I am pleased with the silverware."
"Love these. They look way more expensive than they were. We use them everyday. They are sturdy and shiny. One thing I don't like is the size of the dinner forks. They are too big, but that is the norm these days. We use the dessert forks instead."
"I came back to buy another set and the new set perfectly matches the prior set in quality and size. They feel fantastic, Well weighted, very sturdy. One got accidentally put in the garbage disposal and was thrashed around a bit but other then a couple of expected scratches it was completely unbent! I wish they had butter knifes because I bought that from another brand , actually we more well known one at that and it was completely inferior."
I wish I could give 10 stars. These are just beautiful- usually you neve hear that word with silverware-but they shine like jewelry. Nice weight and very to clean. They are very sturdy and have a lifetime warranty. Very happy with this purchase.
"I have never written a review in my life til now! Absolutely, love this silverware, and I am picky, to say the least. It‚Äôs beautiful, solid, smooth, balanced....really I can‚Äôt say enough good about it. It‚Äôs been through the dishwasher numerous times and come out perfect. You will not regret this purchase."
They came in a very sturdy container. The package was heavy. I was very impressed by the fact each piece was in a plastic sleeve to protect each piece from banging on each other. The pieces are heavy but not too much. Just seems great quality! I have had them for a month and put them in the dishwasher. They clean perfectly! Would highly recommend!
"This silverware is the bomb. Just what I was looking for, so perfect for what we wanted, we got 2 sets. Now we don't run outta silverware when more people come over, and our place settings at the table look great. This silverware looks and feels like QUALITY, the hammered effect is on BOTH SIDES. Wish there was a serving set to go with it to complete the set properly."
I like the weight of this flatware. I like the way it looks. The bowls of the spoons are larger than I‚Äôm used to but I find them quite functional. I keep a few small teaspoons (from my old set) in the drawer for stirring sugar in tea etc. The only problem with cleaning is that some water spots are apparent after the dishwasher. If dried right away no problem. Very pleased with this set overall!
This is a surprisingly nice set of flatware! The pieces are substantial but not too heavy. There is a curve to the handle which makes the flatware comfortable in the hand and no hard edges. Over all I am very pleased with my new flatware pattern.
I love these silverware! This is my first nice matching set of silverware I‚Äôve purchased. I‚Äôve had a selection of crappy random ones for years and thought it was time to get a grown up set. They are a nice heavy weight and cute design. People have complained about the size of the smaller forks and spoons but we use them for dessert and are small enough for our toddler to use them for his regular meals.
"After being disappointed with my recent purchase of another set (which I returned), this set was a pleasant surprise! Highly polished and beautiful to the eye, I can‚Äôt wait to use these utensils. The surface is smooth without imperfections, the weight is perfect and no signs of tarnish anywhere. I should have listened to the reviews and bought these in the first place."
"This is great flatware at a GREAT price (for the 20-piece). Very solid and a nice quality weight to each piece that tells you it's durable. My previous flatware set looked nice, but was relatively flimsy & bent easily. I'm confident that's not going to be the case with this set.  Luckily I'm a bachelor and can survive with the 20-piece set. I was more interested in the 30-piece flatware set but the pricing is comparably unreasonable - more than twice the cost to add 10 more pieces???  UPDATE: posting a picture of the butter knife, to answer a question someone posed. The handle tapers slightly in thickness, from about 1/4"" thick at the base of the blade down to a hair under 3/16"" at the bottom of the handle."
We love these. Surprised at how hefty these were when they arrived which was a positive. The hammered design makes them so easy to hold. Even for our little ones. I went back to order another set just after they arrived and they haven‚Äôt been available again. I think everyone figured out how great they are.
This Silverware set is great. Looks amazing. All the edges are smooth and slightly rounded. Feels heavy and sturdy. No imperfections. I was very surprised about the quality with my set being such a low price. The hammered finish looks great!
"Incredible product! They are beautiful, have a sturdy feel and are perfectly weighted. We get lots of compliments and people often assume it is from Pottery Barn or Williams Sonoma. We searched for a long time for the ultimate hammered flatware and this set is definitely it!"
This is a beautiful set of flatware! We purchased the setting for 12 and are very happy with it. Each piece is sturdy and has weight to it. We use it everyday and it‚Äôs holding up well going through the dishwasher.
"When you hold a piece of this flatware in your hands, you understand this is quality- firm, durable and substantial in the hand. I sent it as a gift to my son and family. We had dinner over there using this set. What a difference."
This is just what I was looking for. These are replacing Crate N Barrel nice hammered silverware-- loved them and had for over 15 years. These I like even better!!! Heavy weight-- but not too much. That was my only complaint with the last set-- they were a little too heavy weight and unevenly distributed. These are the perfect compromise and I have no complaints!
"I got these to (somewhat) match another hammered set. The other set we have is supposed to be nicer, definitely twice the cost, but I absolutely like this set more. They are a nice weight, feel very sturdy in the hand. My only complaint it that the small forks and spoons are a little too small, definitely smaller than any other set I have ever seen. But end up working as a great size for a toddler so that‚Äôs a plus!"
This set a flatware is very nice. It‚Äôs pretty. The flatware has a decent weight to it. It is more modern than what I used to have. I definitely like good quality stainless steel flatware. There‚Äôs a big difference between other brands. I highly recommend this set. I bought a service for 12. I love it!
"This is a great upscale set, we just bought them so I am not sure about durability, but they are heavy, beautiful and very well made. The table spoon is a bit large for me compared to the rest of the set, but other than that, it is a great set! I‚Äôm impressed for how well it‚Äôs made compared to the price!"
"Easy to hold, and well-balanced. It has a comfortable heft. And, it is quite pretty. We got the ‚Äòhammered‚Äô set - simple elegance and nice shape to the spoon."
"Beautiful, long, heavy and high quality material. I always loved having family and friends over on holidays for a big and delicious meal. Even though I had a pretty set of silverware, or was obvious that it wasn‚Äôt high quality material. Short and light would describe. This new set is so elegant and I‚Äôm so excited for my next gathering after this period of quarantine."
"Best flatware I‚Äôve ever had. Feels like a solid, quality utensil. Great diversity of sizing and works well for everyone that‚Äôs used them."
"Nice weight..Great quality! It does get light water spots from the dishwasher, but will rub clear with a lightly damp towel on the way to the utensil draw."
I love the appearance the size and the weight of the silverware!  And I'm sure most people by the silverware so they can have the five piece settings. and at some point I may use the 5-piece settings but one of the things I love is that the regular spoons and the salad forks are big enough to use everyday without feeling like you're eating with the kids fork. With my family of 7 that is a very valuable thing do not have to buy extra an extra and extra sets of silverware.
Awesome!!! Nice weight and great feel in my hand.
They are as pictured. Perfect weight and balance. The really spiff up your table setting!
"I've been putting off purchasing new flatware for 5 years now because I couldn't find any that truly rocked my world...and then I found these. I purchased these for everyday, but these can be used on your most formal table! The flatware is absolutley beautiful and it feels so good in your hand. The finish is everything Danialli claims it to be and more. The reason I only gave it 1 star under the feature for ""light weight"", because it is not, and THAT is a good thing. Sick and tired of cheap and lightweight flatware that just doesn't' ""Bring it to the table"", to coin a phrase. The hammering detail adds a really pretty sparkle when on the table. The pricing is fantastic - where can you get service for 8, quality and beauty for under 100 bucks..who would of thought. I'll be a Danialli customer for the rest of my life. Just plum beautiful!! Thank you for a wonderful product for my tableware!"
"They feel good, solid in your hand. Do not let them air dry, they get a little spotty."
They have a perfect weight polished shiny smooth absolutely exactly what I was looking for pure quality. Probably the finest daily use flatware set I‚Äôve ever owned.
These are much much nice than I expected. They have a nice weight and look and are really well priced for the quality.
"This silverware is absolutely beautiful! After ordering and sending back several sets of ‚Äúhammered‚Äù handles, I found these. Elegant, balanced, perfect mirror finish w stunning handles. Totally perfect!"
Very happy with this flatware purchase... hammered on both sides... nice weight... easy to hold rounded handles (old set square bottom not comfortable to hold)... butter knives cut meat too... teaspoons bigger than I have had but getting used to them and like the change.... very shiney.... a little more expensive than other sets but I am happy I went for it !
"This silverware is simply gorgeous!! They feel very sturdy and solid. They're pleasant to hold and even feel ""natural"" in the mouth. Sounds weird, but the shape is just very pleasant. I'm very pleased with this set."
I love this silverware. It‚Äôs perfect and awesome looking.
"This silverware is so beautiful. The edges are soft and rounded, the hammered print is on both sides, and its very sturdy. There is a big difference between silverware that is 18/10 compared to the cheaper stuff that is 18/0. I highly recommend this silverware for everyday use and for formal use."
"I wish it came with a serving set. I love everything about them, they‚Äôre the perfect weight and look beautiful."
Very good silverware. Everything we expected.
Best silverware ever! Just as expected! Amazing quality!
Love this hammered pattern flatware and the weight of it and smoothness of the grip. Only wish they had the serving pieces to go with it.
"Nice set. I had my old silverware for 10+ years and hated to give it up, but wanted something new and shiny. These are very nice looking and seem substantial with a good weight to them. Also they came packaged very nicely. Would recommend."
"I rarely leave reviews, but I shopped for a while and LOVE this flatware set. Heavy and beautifully made and durable! So happy I ordered this set! Wash‚Äôs great in the dishwasher"
"I like the look and feel of this set. However, I agree with other reviews that the teaspoons and small forks are a bit too small. I would buy extra large spoons and forks if they were available simply because I don't use the smaller forks and spoons because they're so tiny."
I bought this set for the Holiday meals. This set has exceeded my expectations. It arrived nicely boxed and wrapped individually. They have a nice weight to them and don‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy instead they look and feel like a very expensive set! I highly recommend!
"Very gorgeous design that is better in person! I also like that the silverware pieces feel substantial and not flimsy. We have very hard water, so some spots are left behind, but nothing bothersome for me."
"I love the look, the weight, the hold. The more I use this flatware, the more I love it! A great value as well."
"I love the look, feel and weight of this product. I ordered glasses with the same effect. Love, love, love them!"
"It took me a few days to write the review because I was taking time to really use them and see how they feel compared to my other tablewares, until i realized what a hidden gem this is in the ocean of products on Amazon!  First thing, these tablewares are of great value! I have the fancy tablewares I bought from boutique stores in marina diatrict in San Francisco but even compared to those ones, this hammered set has certainly won the game. The quality over price ratio is high and I'm super happy about it!  I HEART the ""hammered"" design! Simplistic and delicate st the same time. It feels like these pieces were being made by hand hammering by an artisan- yep that's the quality that surprised me. They are heavy enough but still light to handle. The longer I look at them, the more I'm fond of the design.  Functionality. The spoons actually have a good volume. I'm a huge soup lover and I have those deep Asian spoons designed for eating soups (the soup spoons you can find in a ramen place), but they are too large or too heavy if they are made of porcelain. These spoons have long handles and are quite deep, very good for soups. Plus my guests that are not familier and 100% comfortable with the Asian spoons, I treat them with these ones. They all loved it!  It's a great gift set too. I'm sending my mom one for Mother's Day :)  Maybe I'm too blinded by the beautiful design and great value, I can't tell a thing that I'm unsatisfued with this set.  I wish they offer chopsticks with the similar design too!! I'd buy them for sure!"
The weight and shine of this silverware speaks to its' quality. I am so happy with this purchase!
Absolutely beautiful and amazing quality!!!! Worth every penny. I have a farmhouse/rustic table and these match perfectly.
"Bought these in November. They are now scratched, discolored and have watermarks after washing in the dishwasher. Very disappointed. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again or recommend."
"These are much more minimalistic than my previous flatware set. Once I got used to how thin they are they ended up working out perfectly fine. They are sturdy and are made of good metal.  I washed them a couple of times before my first use. After using them, the handles showed a little bit of my fingerprints. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs the oils from my hand. When I washed my hands As well as the flatware again it did not show fingerprints.  They also stack very well in my utensil cubby."
This silverware is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. The black matte was a little shinier than I expected but I‚Äôm still very happy with the purchase
Awesome matte finish. All pieces in the set are good sizes and easy to use. They also surprisingly do not show water spots.
"I love this silverware set. Super affordable and the matte black looks AMAZING. I've had them for 9 months, always hand washed and they're holding up pretty well. A few of the forks are starting to have the black coating gone on the ends, just a tiny bit like little scratches. I'll hold on to them a while longer still, but wished they would have lasted a little longer. However, I would say for the price it's worth it. And the beautiful look and feel of the matte black is worth it as well, in my opinion."
Love these! I had no idea that silverware came in colors now. I bought the matte black and absolutely love them! Durable and dishwasher safe. Just have to be careful not to scratch them.
"They feel nice to hold, wash well and hold their shine. Good buy for inexpensive silverware service for 4. I would buy them again."
Love them
I bought these to supplement my everyday utencils because we go thru them all before we can run the dishwasher. I actually like the black look. These are very good utencils for the price. So far I see no erosion of the color. They go thru the dishwasher just fine. They're sturdy. Sure these don't have the heft of more expensive boutique stores. But those stores charge so much. For the price you're getting a good deal.
"I had been looking at silverware similar to these at Target, but the ones there seemed to tarnish and show silver under the matte black. Well I have had these for two months now, put them in the dish washer, used them, and there has been no tarnishing. I get the most compliments on these. Definitely recommend"
This silverware is such a sturdy nice set. *PLEASE READ THIS* I have had ZERO issues with this item. It is Stainless Steel. HAND WASH AND HAND DRY AFTER EACH USE. If you want nice quality items then take care of them. Treat them well. Water stains?.... you didn't hand dry... Chipped paint? Probably put it in ur dishwasher... They may not be good to use in the dishwasher. Take the time out to just hand wash and hand dry and put them back in your cute little drawer. Would recommend it to those who are not lazy.
I‚Äôm extremely unhappy with these‚Ä¶ they are rusting‚Ä¶ I would not buy them again‚Ä¶ and now it‚Äôs too late to return them‚Ä¶
These look amazing. Better than I imagined. Only issue I've found is you have to hand dry or there will be so many water spots. Absolutely worth buying. Love them.
These are great. I had a set of silverware for 19 years. Hopefully this set will last just as long as long as the kids doesn‚Äôt toss them in the trash! The material of the silverware is light and sturdy. I love how they fit in the nifty drawer I have for my silverware! Great product for the price can‚Äôt beat it! Highly recommend for daily use!
"light but not too thin that they would look cheap. Love the satin look. However if you're looking for something fancy and look expensive, say for the holiday, this set wouldn't be it."
"Bought a different set of matte black silverware from Amazon a year ago. My Orders had this set as the link of my previous purchase. So, I hit buy again and purchased more. I unwrapped, washed them and put them away. It wasn‚Äôt until I closely compared my original set to this one that I noticed a difference. I did initially think they felt lighter and thinner, but didn‚Äôt pay much attention. This set is thin, light weight, but good. If you‚Äôre looking for heavy and expensive, this isn‚Äôt for you. If you‚Äôre looking for sleek, contemporary and light weight- this IS for you! I like them. I like my original set better, but I really do like this set. I‚Äôll keep!"
"I am very picky with my utensils. They have to be a specific shape and weight. I got so lucky when I found these. They are just the perfect and weight and not your typical silver, I really love the matte black. I bought two packs due to one pack only having four of each utensil in it. I hate doing dishes, so honestly anything that helps me push it off a day or two."
"I ordered 2 packs of these and they match my dishware set! I love black and matte black is my thing. My only complaint is (say you were cutting a steak with with fork and knife, I have the kitchen aid knife set) the tips of the forks will show all of the cut markings, but thats understandable."
Still giggling that they call this silverware when it‚Äôs gold...
These utencils are beautiful and functional. We've had them for a few months now and none have bent like our previous utencils. The metal is thick and strong but still comfortable to hold in your hand. We wash by hand (we don't own a dishwasher) and they clean very easily but do show water spots if not dried with a towel after. We are very happy with our purchase.
"Originally, I gave the quality of this product a 3, but I am updating to a 5 star rating due to the seller being so helpful and refunding me for the silverware set."
I‚Äôve had these for over 6 months now and I‚Äôm still obsessed. They are SUPER light weight which I love and they still look brand new! Highly recommend especially for the price!
"Bought two sets, really nice set, fairly lightweight, seems very durable. I've had them for about two weeks and have used and cleaned them several times, no visible scratches or scuffs! I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet, but will update once I do. Definitely suggest you try these, great value!"
"Was worried when I first held it as they feel alot lighter and thinner than my old silverware. But theyre actually stronger. Dug into the ice cream container where my old spoon would bend trying to scoop, these held up. And they look stylish too"
"I wasn‚Äôt sure about these when looking. I went ahead and got them anyway. Once I received them, I knew I was good. They have a good weight to them and are comfortable. They have held up well in the dishwasher too."
EDIT: After using them a couple times. DO NOT use them in your dishwasher. They chip and it just because ugly.  I wanted the ones from hearth and hand from target but these are way better!!!
Christmas gift for my wife as she always wanted this silverware. She was thrilled and surprised. She loves the silverware. Its been very sturdy and cleans well but needs to be wiped dry depending on the hardness of your water.
Sturdy to hold yet sleek. I wash these in my dishwasher and have had no issues. I bought several black sets before I found these. Such a great buy.
"Black utensils are a stunning statement. Easy to clean. haved used in dishwasher too and they look fine. Lightweight enough to be more comfortable than my previous stainless steel ones, which were really expensive. Ordered a 3rd set."
"As others have stated, these silverware pieces are very lightweight--nearing what some would call ""cheap"" feeling. However, I love them. Bought one set. Liked them so much bought another set."
I put these in the dishwasher daily and they are doing just fine. They still give me the modern sophisticated look I want for my kitchen and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice quality.
Just received them and they are so beautiful I‚Äôm very curious to see how these hold up. They feel heavy duty so hopefully I get a lot of use out of them.
"so glad I purchased this, and here where it‚Äôs much cheaper than other retailers of the same product. sleek, comfortable, easy to clean. have gotten many compliments on this set. will be getting another."
"One happy lady. Slightly pricey, for only four of each item. But I‚Äôm impressed with quality. Easy to get clean, love the color and they‚Äôre not too heavy but don‚Äôt feel cheap at the same time. Overall, happy with my purchase."
Wanted differen5 than silver. Love the black set. Got 3. Look great.
"Good color, solid product. Purchased 2x set to fill drawer."
How to get used to the lighter weight of the flatware. Looks very nice and different. Seems to be durable. We‚Äôll see how they last.
Not as thick as I had hoped but are nice colored and good silverware
"Purchased 3 sets of these for a Thanksgiving gathering. They are extremely light, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting the actual quality. We got the satin black. So far they are excellent. Have washed in dishwasher and hand washed. Sturdy and elegant."
"I love this new set! Very thick and sturdy, the color is perfect! Would buy for a gift for someone"
Great quality! I put together a few examples of what my wedding tableware my look like and I was most happy with the silverware.
I've had this set for almost a year now. We use them daily and they go through the dishwasher constantly. The have all held up very well and we get lots of compliments.
we love this set !! It is truly amazing . We have had them for about a month and so far they are like new !! I would recommend them üíØ. We will be buying more soon .
My son loves this set.
Love the look and price
I was kind of nervous about ordering these I thought the black wood chip away or come off... But they're beautiful and sleek... Match with my dishware perfectly
Exactly what I was looking for and cleans very well!
Bought 2 sets and absolutely love so much!!! I am washing them in dish washer now.. curious to see if water spots will be on them or not!! I pray not because they are beautiful!!
These look really nice. The spoons and forks are a good size. Not to big or small. I was worried they would look odd or not as black as I thought. But they actually look just like I thought they would. I'm really happy with them so far.
I really like this silverware set. I was worried that after washing there would be water spots but that has not been an issue. Really great quality and the fork and spoon sizes are good too.
"I love these, went well in dishwasher multiple times already. I get so many compliments on these! About to buy another set!"
"Very nice set, very happy with the purchase. Not sure about the durability, But seem to be holding up well thus far. Have put them in the dishwasher and seem fine. They do show fingerprints, but as to be expected with a matte finish."
"These are thick, sturdy, and worth the value. I absolutely love these!"
Good Buy
Loved this gold color!!!  Order in black also. The black is nice but has a shine and not as matte and the gold but they look awesome together  Haven‚Äôt used them yet but will update review on durability
"This is a beautiful set. I don't recommend scooping hardened icecream with them, but other than that, they're great!"
They are exactly what I wanted great quality
I‚Äôve had these for two or three months now. They have gone through at least ten dishwashes and the color looks as good as the day I unpacked them. The color didn‚Äôt fade or scratch off. I really love these.
"The utensils are sturdy, with no defects, not missing any. Not easy to bend, great product."
"Was searching for a set of black flatware, and this is the perfect set. Not too heavy and not too lightweight. Only complaint is sometimes you can see the watermarks after washing them, but overall they feel elegant."
"Stylish, price effective, and didn't end up covered in water spots after cleaning. Highly recommended"
Had them for a few weeks and they‚Äôre starting to chip a tad bit
Pretty solid set and they have held up pretty good with the dishwasher as well
"Love, love , love these! They go so well with the rest of my stuff in my kitchen!"
Just what I was looking for; a black sturdy set. Very well made for the price.
El color mate es super bello
I expected the paint to chip or peel off but so far has endured during the 6-7 months I‚Äôve owned this.
I love this
I bought 2 sets for my granddaughter and her husband for Christmas! They love the look and weight of the silverware!
I love this utensil set! I liked that it came with 2 fork sizes AND 2 spoon sizes. It‚Äôs super easy to clean and also matches my aesthetic.
"NO They are not fancy but very attractive, and useable, though simple and lightweight Nonetheless, for the price this set rocks, and I will buy another just to make sure I have enough for quests if I have more than 8-friends over. OH AND UNLIKE FINE SILVER...I will not freak if I sacrifice one to the garbage disposal. HEEE"
This is the first time I‚Äôve ordered silverware and I doubt because I thought it‚Äôs too thin . Glad it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs better than my expectation . Complete set and fast shipping loved this brand .
"If you are looking for a simple design, heavy weight, easy to clean flatware set, this is that set. I absolutely love it. So easy to clean with it's simple sleek design that always looks polished and clean. The set even feels good compared to other flatware I have purchased. I can't describe the feeling, but it's almost like touching silk or as the name says satin. Best part, dishwasher safe and they haven't lost that feel. The flatware is very sturdy, I don't foresee anyone in my family ever bending the spoons back or the prongs on the forks out of wack. My only fear is them losing pieces."
When it comes to silverware there's not much to say lol. It's either good or it's not. These are sturdy and feel like quality silver ware. Love that it comes with so many pieces!
"I was very pleased with the overall look. I was looking for something for everyday use and it is very sturdy and lightweight, easy to clean and store. This silverware not only looks great but feels great. I was very impressed by the quantity of each item and the price as they were both perfect."
It‚Äôs a decent set for the price. Minimalists delight. It‚Äôs sturdy & gets the job done. Worth the price.
Surprising quality for the price
Better then the dollar store I tell you lol but no great product
It was a gift
Very nice product and different size
Good set for the money. High quality silverware
"Good fit for daily use on dining table, quality wise also fine."
Just what I was looking for
already on the table
Very cheap quality but serves the purpose
"I‚Äôm shocked this flatware got such great reviews. I needed something to add to our silverware cause it seems to disappear. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot, cause kids‚Ä¶but It‚Äôs so cheaply made. Edges are tough and blunt, metal is thin and flimsy enough I can bend the pieces. The tablespoons are the size of serving spoons. The little forks and spoons were a normal size but still thin and easily bendable. I can‚Äôt imagine these will hold up for any decent amount of time. I will just donate these and buy something better. Don‚Äôt waste your money even though it‚Äôs cheap. Much better quality to be had for $10 more! The pics are the large spoons compared to my large spoons and my serving spoon. The large fork is next to my large fork."
"They are thin and quite light, but for the price they are alot better then I expected them to be!"
"All the other utensils were perfect, but the fork wasn't curved enough at the end, and I know from experience that it's very hard to scoop up anything with a good fork. Still, if you're looking for an inexpensive set of silverware, I think this will do the job, I'm just picky about the whole fork thing."
"This set is ok I guess. From the reviews I guess I expected better quality. They are light weight, too light in my opinion. But cheap."
Overall not bad but it‚Äôs definitely flat and oversized
Nice set but very thin. We used them for an outdoor event. I would not use them for everyday use.
"It was a good deal, worth the money."
"If you have kids and you silverware frequently disappears, then this set may be fine for you. I find them small and flat compared to my other pieces."
"These would be great for anyone that has a problem lifting heavier silverware. The knives look like they were run over by a steamroller. But as the saying goes you pay for what you get. They also have what I would call baby forks, a waste."
"cheap looking (made in china like everything else nowadays), thin for stainless steel."
I felt this silverware was flimsy and like something you would find in a low end diner. I would not recommend.
They are light weight but are not very nice looking. The quality wasn‚Äôt the best.
"This is a 40 piece set, i just expected it to be a better quality after reading the reviews."
That give the meaning of flatware. Forks were flat and spoons sizes are odd
This set is cheap. I could easily bend them. One of the forks was missing half a tine. BUYER BEWARE!!
These were extremely thin. Salad forks were the size of an appetizer fork almost. Teaspoons were very small as well. Not worth the money.
"This is the flimsiest set of silverwarw I have ever seen. ""MIRROR"" finish is dull stainless at best. The knives are paper thin. Will bend with little effort at all. TOTAL GARBAGE. They are being returned."
Not worth the money
"The forks are the size of Lobster forks, the larger spoons are too big."
This is a horrible product. Bends with ease. Nothing solid about them. Do not waste your money!
Very light and cheaply made.
THIS PRODUCT IS EXTREMEMLY LIGHT (LIKE PAPER) VERY CHEAP
"I needed (wanted) a new set of flatware. I was hesitant to buy something sight unseen, but glad I chose these. They are not lightweight or flimsy, have a great shine on them and look way classier than the price would indicate. Definitely a great deal!!"
Durable and classic it looks perfect in my kitchen.
"Great for the value, average silverware. Not too heavy and not too light."
Too big spoons.Picture shows small shape.Too heavy to use.Finishing is ok not super.
Where does the sock fairy take the forks?
"Pretty hard to mess up a fork. The key for me was delivery. Ordered it one day, arrived the next."
I used them for every day extra forks
I love this product. They are a great value for the money. Beautifully crafted and just what I needed as the trash can took my forks.
Has held up thru daily dishwasher washings & oh so pretty! Very quality for the price point.
Love the sleek look of these. They aren‚Äôt very heavy but heavy enough to feel like quality. Which they are. They don‚Äôt rust and I get compliments on them all the time
"Was looking for a sturdy, attractive set of flatware to use daily. Product more than met my expectations. It is heavy enough to be durable without being cumbersome. This is the first time I have purchased black flatware, but I actually quite pleased with the appearance."
"The satin finish adds to their beauty. They are sturdy, feel comfortable in your hand. An elegant addition to even your everyday place settings."
Great product love them
"Pierden el color, al secarlos el pa√±o queda dorado"
"I‚Äôve wanted to change up my existing silverware with a pretty rose gold and thought this would be great. After only a week of using the silverware and running it through the dishwasher, the rose gold is already coming off! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting this and I wish I could send it back but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs too late :("
Disappointed in lack of quality control. This set did not match others I purchased. Returning.
This stainless steel 24 piece rose gold flatware set is beautiful and durable.  The price is reasonable and they look fancy. They are dishwasher safe. We are happy with them.
"Love how this set gives you so many utensils. Very durable and sturdy enough to pick up basically all foods. These utensils also do not leave that much of a metallic taste when eating food as well. They are however a little heavy to hold, but I kind of like the weight. Love the variety of these utensils."
Dont waste your money. The rose gold comes off after 3 washes. I loved these up until that point.
Loved it
"I love this, the way they look is just really nice. I needed some extra silverware. I liked it because it wasn‚Äôt expensive and I wasn‚Äôt concerned about it matching my already existing silverware. Seems to be very sturdy and worth the money. I was able to match this with my knife set though. Which looks really nice.  The different sizes are useful but not a big deal.  The one issue I see is that the surface in between the fork teeth is not smooth. The quality of them is bit rough and makes it look like they didn't smooth the surface."
So beautiful. Handwash.
Se va cayendo lo negro....
