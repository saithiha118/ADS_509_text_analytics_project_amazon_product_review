"super pleased with these bowls from very hot soup to very cold desserts it accomodates it all. No leaking, no saturation and no excessive coating. Natural and functional. Will repeat the order when they are all gone. On days when there is just no room in the dishwasher they are perfect so one does not have to waste water hand washing. They were great too, when a family member had covid and we kept them on toss away plates and bowls."
"During the ramadan, i served the soups in these cute cups. Good for quick eatable things even though liquid and hot. After 10-15 minutes if you keep the hot soup in it, dont trust the durability."
Sturdy and worth the money.
We use these bowls for a lot of our outdoor events and they have never let us down. Very study and leak proof.
As food bowl for puppy
But they will compost well.
BOWL LEAKS-UNUSABLE-WASTE OF MONEY
"I received this set of 150 12-ounce compostable bowls in great condition. They come wrapped in plastic. I did not realize how small 12 ounces is, and that's my fault, but just a heads up that for adults it is a very small size. I would say they are probably good for snacking or being mindful of your portions. I think they are a perfect size for small children. I mostly use them for dry snacks like chips, but I decided that my real test would be with liquids. I used one of these bowls for hot tomato soup, and it did really well. The shedding on it was minimal at most, and that was only towards the end when my spoon would scrape against the sides. I am impressed with these bowls' durability and performance, considering that they are compostable and eco-friendly. Price is a little steep, but like other eco-friendly dinnerware, that is to be expected."
"The older that I get, the more that I find myself looking for alternatives to plastics. These bowls work in an excellent fashion and I am amazed at how well these hold water. These have an innate ability to resist falling apart like some others that I’ve tried. I’ve got no earthly idea as to how they do it but I can say these don’t get all soggy in a few hours…or even a few days usually. I say this because I have left a few of them outside as a dish for my baby chickens as a water bowl and they haven’t leaked. Yes, the bottom gets a bit gross because they’re outside and chickens aren’t the cleanest but I’m seriously impressed. These are an outstanding alternative.  Pros:  Made very well Super strong Holds water for days Outstanding alternative to plastics Good value  Cons:  None so far"
"100% Compostable Paper Bowls [12 oz.] – 150 Disposable Bowls Eco Friendly Sturdy Tree Free Liquid and Heat Resistant Alternative to Plastic or Paper Bowls by Ecovita  I love the fact that these are paper bowls instead of plastic. They hold up reasonably well and work with hot or cold food items. A nice quantity per pack, too, so a good amount to stock up on some disposables that I can feel good about."
Commercially compostable these 12 ounce bowls are made from paper not plastic. They were a bit lighter than expected and my concern was whether the bowl could tolerate a hot bowl of soup or would it collapse or leak so I filled one with boiling water. After waiting 10 minutes I checked and there were no leaks and although the exterior or the bowl was warm it was not hot to the touch. Good disposable bowls.
"First of all ... these bowls are smaller than I thought they'd be. They are good for children's portions of cereal or mac and cheese ... or would be fantastic appetizer-sized bowls for a holiday party. The photo of the 2 meatballs I added is a good representation of the bowls' capacity. Those are two regular-sized (medium) meatballs and that's about what fits into one bowl.  If you are hosting a party with hot h'orderves and would like to set them out on a table, these are a decent size and the best part about them is that they are ecologically responsible as they will biodegrade. They are made from Bamboo and Sugarcane and are, of course, made in China. While they aren't as aesthetically pleasing as the white paper bowls, given that these have a rougher cardboard appearance ... what they lack in presentation, they make up for in environmental responsibility.  I tested them on a few items and here is what I found ... - Meatballs, these held up well and they were rigid enough to cut through the meatball without bending or puncturing the bottom. They held their shape nicely and the edges didn't crush while being held. They did tend to have tomato sauce and oil soak into the inner bowl but after 10 minutes, this did not go through/appear on the outside of the bowl.  - Cereal and milk ... The bowl held a small portion of cereal and milk and did not crunch in when handled. The milk was in the bowl fpr about 10 minutes and did not soak through the bowl.  - Piece of pie ... The pie's wedge shape did not fit into the bowl but I was able to smoosh the tip in a bit. With harder crust pies and cakes, you'd have an issue with fit. The bowl held up well to cutting the pie into bite-sized pieces and did not puncture.  I did not have ice cream to try with this but given my experience, I would think they would be ideal for a one scoop ice cream sundae or a kid's birthday with single scoops. The bowls appear to hold liquids well enough for shorter periods (I did not test longer than 20-30 minutes.)  Overall, while I wish the bowls were larger and adult meal-sized, these will be good for snacking, handing out samples, or kids' meals/snacks. They handle hot foods well and don't seem to leak or leach through within 10 minutes or so. I will look to see if they have adult-sized plates and bowls for meals. Sometimes, we want a quick dinner in front of the tv and not have to worry about washing dishes later. Using responsible biodegradable servingwear like this makes me feel better about using plastic bowls or paper bowls coated with a plastic, which breaks down slowly.  The size of these don't do much for me ... but for those with kids, restaurant owners, Superbowl party snacks and appetizer buffets or tailgating, they'd be great!"
"We always seem to run out of bowls, so it is nice to have these available when needed. They are sturdy and hold up well to dry or liquid ingredients. They are fine for single use, but we have used them multiple times for dry snacks.  The bowls do not bend and spill the contents. They do not disintegrate when filled with liquid, even over a few hours.  A great supply to have on hand."
"The size of these bowls is great for snacks for our kids or just condiments. It can basically fit a doughnut in it to give you an idea of the actual size.  The look of these are great, the eco-friendly aspect of them is awesome too.  There were no flavors or smells I noticed added from these bowls so that's awesome as well.  Overall, I love these, would recommend."
"really good value pack for small bowls. they are the perfect size for portioned meals and snacks. on the downside, while they are sturdy and feel great, they tend to look really ugly as soon as any amount of grease touches them. be careful and don't be alarmed by how the bowl starts to look as soon as you put some potato chips in there. it'll look scary but it still functions fine"
"These are very well made ""paper"" bowls. Thy hold up well to everything I have thrown at them, including hot soup. I was not aware how small these are. I believe that they may hold about one cup of liquid. I'm not sure what you use that for other than maybe some nuts or fruit salad or some side dish. Overall good but be aware of the size before you buy."
"Strong and sturdy. I use them for holding and carrying food. However, they're flammable so I can't keep them by the stove as I often do with paper bowls. And they're stronger than paper bowls. Disposable and compostable. Better than plastic."
"These are a good value for the amount of bowls you get. They are great for small items, like ice cream. I like that they are compostable. The only thing is that I wish they were a little bigger."
"I like these bowls a lot. They have a rustic feel, are pretty sturdy. You can use them for food, or really anything, like for household projects."
Love these bowls! Sturdy and convenient
"These balls are small in size, and are great for things such as ice cream and sides. The problem is that they aren’t to durable against liquid. As you can see in my photo, the liquid begins to make its way through the bowl. This can be an issue if you don’t want to make a mess."
These are very small and flimsy. I don't know what I could actually use them for.
Way smaller than what I thought but I’m keeping them bc it helps me to eat less. Very durable even after microwaving  Doesn’t leak after microwaving soup  I would recommend for kid size and is a good way to eat less
Everything. We use them when traveling.
Told my daughter who is 17 that they are unbreakable this girl through this on to ground before I could say not too. Not in a soft fashion full on I am going to prove my father wrong. Did not break or even scuff. Even after chasing her around the house pelting her with it no breaky. I will update after we have tried the bat.
"Site says microwave safe. Wrong. Bowls are disintegrating in the microwave. Clear, small, linear strings are falling off the bowls when used in the microwave."
"We love these bowls. They are so durable! We have four kids (4-13) and these bowls have been dropped, washed, microwaved, used for hot an cold things, and they still look amazing! Definitely recommend."
The bowl started peeling after getting hot.
"The size of these bowls are perfect. Most bowls are pretty small, but these are perfect for soups, chili, and breakfast cereal. I have to hand wash my dishes and these clean up very easily, and are not breakable. I liked them so much I ordered 2 sets."
"It says microwave safe, but this is what happened when I microwaved food for 3min.. it melted!!"
Too small and not safe in microwave You can buy at Walmart for 50 cents and microwave safe
"I am delighted with the quality and size of these environmentally-friendly bowls. They are perfect for cereal - the best bowl I've had in a while that holds my cereal, bananas (or other fruit) & plenty of milk without spilling. They are easy to clean and stack. I highly recommend these bowls. I ordered dishes to match, which I also like ... but I LOVE THESE BOWLS."
"I have used these bowls in my microwave many times and no problem. Since this is September 2021, wonder if they have improved them as many people said they were not microwave safe. Also I will store sauces with a tomato base in them in the freezer. When I go to wash them the coloring from the sauces completely comes off immediately unlike some plastic containers that always retain some of the sauce color. I recommend them highly"
"These are made of ""wheat starch"" and are biodegradable. They were even advertised as having a slight ""pleasant smell"" of wheat which I thought was weird. Someone even asked if they were gluten-free, LOL. Although I thought the idea was strange they have held up well so far after several weeks of washing them in the dishwasher. I imagine that I will get a few good years of use out of them. I bought them for prep bowls because I kept breaking my glass bowls and I was tired of cleaning up the mess. I have limited mobility in my right hand. This was a great solution. They are the right size for both prep and eating, and I like the muted colors."
"These are fantastic with a little bit of extra care. Very light compared to ceramic bowls--which get boiling hot while food is still cold. These don't get hot in the microwave as long as you don't go too long. I've done 2 minutes, stir the food and then another 30 to 60 seconds without issue. If one gets stained I just throw it out. After six months I haven't thrown any out despite putting pasta sauce or other food that stains."
"I make lots of homemade soups, 5 gallons at a time. We then freeze them in 2C containers and microwave them at our leisure. This is our primary use for these. Our past bowls were handled ceramics. They got very hot in the microwave and although they were ""microwave safe"" most of them cracked on us - just thawing and heating soup. These comments are based on this use.  Pros: * Don't heat up in the microwave, so unless your food gets hot enough to melt these, they will be great. * Because of the above, thick soups do not burn to the sides of the bowl while microwaving making cleanup SUPER easy. * They are super light. * They are great heat insulators, I can hold a bowl of soup that is too hot to eat. They get a little warm right where the soup is, but they have a little ridge around the bottom so when the soup is very hot, I can hold the bowl by the ridge and the rim. By the time it is edible, the entire bowl is cool to the touch. * They seem pretty strong. * Inexpensive - always a plus. * Good enough that I already bought 8 more ;-)  Cons: *They look like cheap plastic. Not really a con since you can see what they look like on the picture, but I would love to find some nicely designed bowls made out of this material."
"No, this is not a Megadeth review. This is my bowl review. Bowl is very lightweight and somewhat flexible. while I had my reservations about this bowl when I first received it, it does what I need it to do. That is, warm up my oatmeal or soup here at work. I am a New England clam chowder guy, and you all know how that stuff can cling to and burn a plastic dish, specially when not cooked properly. Anyway, this dish had no problems warming up my soup in the microwave here at work. When used properly in the microwave to warm up soup, it handles that job perfectly."
"After breaking a very large glass plate and cleaning up tiny bits of glass for days afterward, I decided to transition to something other than glass. These bowls fit the bill perfectly. Now, I don't have to worry about broken glass. They are lightweight yet very sturdy. They hold quite a bit of food. They are also easy to clean. I purchased the matching plates to go with them a few days later as I was so pleased with the bowls. Oh, and they arrived super fast. There are matching glasses that you can purchase separately or you can buy the whole set of plates, bowls, and glasses, including table utensils (knives, spoons and forks of the same material), together. I think that you'll like them as much as I do. I'm going to order the matching glasses."
"I was using dollar store ceramic/glassware as my primary food service stuff, themselves an upgrade from paper plates which made every meal seem like a picnic, indoors, with the shades drawn, eating by monitor-light.  Eventually I realized that if I drop these things - AGAIN - it will be a huge pain, so I looked for an alternative to the bowls. I found these, and they seem great. Microwave safe, dishwasher safe, solid and secure enough, easy to clean, and so on.  Decent price too."
"I made an egg in one in the microwave this morning, perfect size for a bagel sandwich. I made crab salad in one for lunch. They're the perfect size for single meals, clean easily and don't heat up in the microwave. They will transfer heat from the cooked item, but the top of the bowl is easily in an acceptable temperature range after cooking."
"OMG sometimes things aren’t what you like when buying from the internet. This is not the case with this company. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I needed outdoor dishes for my Lanai here in Hawaii & the pictures don’t do these products justice. So pleased with all of their products. I ordered the bowls, plates, utensils appetizer plates & the cups. I will be ordering again Love love love these products!! Thanks so much"
"These bowls are great! I've put them through their paces, both in the microwave and dishwasher. They seem as perfect as when I unboxed them. Even oily salad dressing washes out easily, and cheese dip and marinara warmed in the microwave didn't stain them. I'm definitely happy with an eco friendly product that actually does a great job. Considering adding the plates and cups!"
"The bowl is sturdy and durable. I thought it would be some small, baby size bowl, but no its perfect portion controlled size. I could get a good bowl of cereal and milk in here. I'm mad it only comes with 4 for this price of $10, but I guess."
"Sturdy, ridiculous easy to clean (""impossible"" debris wipes right off with an hour soak). Unlike some other reviewers here, I *have* had success with these in the microwave - I've made oatmeal and spaghetti-o's innumerable times where the only problem is that the tomato sauce requires a soak to clean. There's literally nothing bad I can think of about these bowls."
"These bowls are very sturdy. I like these bowls a lot. My daughter cooked ravioli in a bowl in the microwave. It did leave a stain in the bowl originally but after several more uses and trips through the dishwasher I don't see the stain anymore and I don't even know which bowl it was. The bowls are a nice size, lightweight, easy to clean and I would definitely buy again."
""
"I don't know why, but we seem to go through ceramic and glass kitchenware. We were down down t one big cereal bowl and I ordered these. I love them. They have a nice feel to them, not plastic or cheap. I don't have any problem serving them to a guest. They clean easily. Actually, I wish that they were available in a larger size, for mixing and serving."
"These plates and bowls are so easy to clean. We love the plates, my 23 year old grandson who is on the autism spectrum and spills alot with regular plates, use this without spilling because of the big lips the plates have on them. He is very confident in these plate. The bowls for cereal and soup are very deep so less spills. These will not breah"
"I have been eating cereal and soup and other ""wet"" foods out of flat soup bowels all my life. They don't hold much,they spill easy, food gets cold quick. They don't work. I finally ordered these bowels. They are the right size, they don't tip all the time and food stays the right temperature. I love them and would highly recommend them."
"I love these bowls! if you never owned anything like them before, the feel will take a bit to get used to but in the end its worth it. You don't have to worry about them breaking, but yet they are a bit more studier then straight plastic. They wash easily in the dishwasher, big bonus. They are microwave safe, and they even come with a bonus cleaning sponge! I just ordered more to have on hand."
"Have had for 10 months. size and shape perfect. Wonderful for arthritic hands. pleasant colors. Sturdy, look like new after regular use. I have heated food in microwave, but not used for cooking stuff and have not had any melting or material shedding."
"My kid and her friends have a hard time remembering which plates I own are microwavable and which are not. So I decided to replace all the plates, bowls, etc in the house that ate not microwavable with these wheatgrass products. So far, I love them! These bowls have a slick inner surface which makes them easier to clean. Love the colors also. They are light weight, yet seem perfectly sturdy. Top notch product!"
"These are the best bowls I have ever used. I use them for everything. They do pick up a stain from sauce or chili if you microwave them, just like tupperware does, but they are super durable. They smell a little funky out of the box, but after a quick wash they are good to go. The colors arent obnoxious, and they hold quite a lot without feeling obstructively large."
I have not had the problem in the microwave that some people have. I like knowing that these safe for my kids to use. They are not flimsy like most of the plastic bowls we have used in the past and we are not getting led poisoning from ceramic bowls.
"Great for cereal! Bought to replace my husband's favorite cereal bowl! We find these nice a deep, great for cereal or a big bowl if chili! Cleansing well, doesn't stain easily. Holds up in the dishwasher!"
If kids are always breaking your bowls (or your clumsy husband) buy these they are just the right size for a cereal bowl. You can fill half way for kids and your husband can fill it all the way up. These are nice and clean up great in the sink or dishwasher
I bought these bowls to replace some plastic ones I have had for years. I was concerned about size and if they would stand up to using them in my microwave. The size is perfect for my morning cereal and they seem to be fine in the microwave. Only time will tell about the microwave.
These are great bowls. I was looking for something that was light weight and wouldn’t break if dropped. They clean easily and hold a lot. I’m even considering getting another set.
"These are indeed expensive, buuuuut worth it. I tossed all of my kids cheap plastic plates and bowls and replaced them with these because they kept trying to microwave on the thin plastic plates. They have held up great, cleaned well in the dishwasher, and survived the microwave on a few occasions. Highly recommended."
I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these bowls but was pleasantly surprised. They seem sturdy enough and clean and dry off easily. I don't have a dishwasher so they get hand-washed. They don't pass on any funny chemical-like tastes to the food and no odor. An excellent non-plastic alternative solution that won't take centuries to decompose in a landfill!
"Have had these bowls for about a year now and I have no complaints. They are sturdy, dishwasher and microwave safe and do not stain. Great item and I would buy again."
"I like that we can use these in the microwave. They're great for heating up leftovers or soups, also good for cold stuff. After several cycles through the dishwasher they're still holding up nicely with no staining (I enjoy tomato soup!), no cracks or anything else which would indicate poor quality. They're really nice bowls. The colors are nice too."
"I was unsure of what to expect from a bowl made of wheat. But I can confirm that they are durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I haven't tried them in the microwave. They are large and deep, perfect for cereal."
"Purchased these with the intent of using them in our camping trailer. We were looking for light and easy, and plates that would fit into the little sink in our Casita. These work perfectly! They clean easily and are big enough for our meals. Love the fact that they are eventually compostable! Can highly recommend."
"I keep chipping my glass bowls when washing dishes, so I decided to find bowls that won't break instead. These have worked fantastically! At first I thought the box was empty, these were so light. Will definitely purchase again when needed."
Have these for months. I don't use them in the dishwasher even though I read it's not plastic. I do use them in the microwave though. So I don't know lol. But can drop them from a high surface and don't break. Durable and light. Use them for my daughter
"We also have other products by this manufacturer and find all of them sturdy, dishwasher safe, and attractive. I highly recommend them. In fact, I give sets as gifts."
They may be smaller than expected but turned out to be the perfect size for noodles and soup. They are dishwasher and microwave safe which is a big plus. Great for kids since they are sturdy and can take a beating. Love them.
"The perfect bowl. I purchased these because ceramic cereal bowls were scratching my table. These bowls solved that, and more! The shape is perfect for keeping the cereal off the sides, making it easier for kids or challenged adults. These are cute, durable and easy to clean. I’m ordering more!"
"We just got these bowls in. I purchased them because we are hard on bowls and mugs, and I was down to two soup bowls. We already love them. They are lightweight, but they are sturdy, we've dropped one and it just spun around. They went through the microwave and dishwasher fine."
These are nice bowls. They appear to be unbreakable. They are also a bit smaller than I expected from the pictures from the seller.
We use these for our breakfast cereal and for dessert after our evening meal. The weight of these bowls make it easy to use while sitting outside and eating from them.
"good and usefull size ; beating 3 eggs for - - ,a bowl of cereal , waffle batter for 1 . and they don't break if you drop them."
Love these! Bought them because little kids and glass bowls don’t mix. And they are super cute. We all use them and will be getting more. My daughter heated up spaghetti and I thought that was the end of the bowl and it didn’t stain!
"Very nice, lightweight and the best thing is that they don't come out hot from the microwave! They hold just the right amount and are very pretty. The only thing I can't do is let my dog lick the bowl, she will try to eat it - So I guess I can say that the bowl seems ""tasty"" too."
"These bowls are super useful. Light and sturdy, they are used multiple times a day. In fact, they are the only bowls I use now. I liked these so much that I purchased a matching set of plates."
"These bowls are great. I bought them for use in my RV--lightweight, durable and safely microwaveable. I also like that it washes easily even if the food in it was greasy. Colors are very pretty too."
"My husband loves these bowls. They are lightweight, a nice size to hold soup with lots of crackers, and the bowls stay cool enough to hold onto. They can go in the dishwasher too!"
"I love the colors, they are easy to clean and go in the dishwasher, microwave. I bought these for cereal and a set in the same colors just a little larger for salads. I love them both. They are sturdy, easy to hold and easy to use and clean."
I got these for my grandchildren. I wanted something that was Microwave safe and unbreakable. These are perfect! I like them so much I ordered 2 more sets to use as salad bowls for family dinners.
These bowls come in cute colors and are very easy to clean. They are very lightweight which makes them easy to carry by my toddler but unbreakable for when he drops them! They are the perfect size for cereal or oatmeal in the mornings.
"Bought them and same glasses for when I go out of town, staying in hotel or camping. Very lightweight, microwaveable, clean easy and environmentally friendly."
"I purchased these bowls because I did not want to purchase plastic and I wanted something that was very versatile, that could be good for eating cereal, making salads, and heating up food in the microwave. They are also very easy to clean. I am very happy with these bowls"
"These haven't broken, biodegraded in my sink, chipped, discolored, or done anything but be good bowls. I'm a clumsy old person who drops things. These will outlast me. Then they can biodegrade."
I love these. I have sensory issues with people clanking utensils with plates and bowls and this has been a lifesaver from major stress.
"The bowls are very lightweight, can go in the microwave, but they don't get hot! They are also easy to wash whether by hand or in the dishwasher. I may replace all my china, melamie, plastic, etc. with wheatgrass products."
I have used these bowls for 2 years and they have worn well so I ordered another set. I like that they do not get really hot when microwaved. The size is also good for most needs.
These are very nice plastic bowls. The colors are really pretty and they wash well. Perfect size.
No complaints works well in the microwave Worth the money I paid will buy again if I need more bowls
"Love these bowls! I got a set of these for my rv to replace all the plastic and I'm so happy with them, they clean SO well, don't get hot to the touch in the microwave, are light weight and just plain cute. I completely recommend these to anyone!"
"These are the perfect size, deep bowl holds foods better than a regular cereal bowl. Sturdy, unbreakable when dropped. This is my second order. We use often, so 4 were not enough for the two of us! Thank you!"
"These bowls are great! Just the right size for cereal, soup, leftovers etc etc. Very sturdy and easy to clean. They do well in the dishwasher and microwave. Great seller too. Fast and thoughtful."
I love these! Have matching plates. Clean up good and look awesome. Easy to clean💥💥💥👍
"Very nice colors, go with anything, light weight and easy to clean"
"I use these bowls for rice bowl meals and soups. They hold 1/qt and are large enough for a hearty serving, but not too large. I have been looking for bowls lie this for several months and was very happy to find these. Thank you Kungee!"
"These bowls came in shipped super secure, and were so helpful for the Autumn curries and pot pie I wanted to make! My other bowls were way too small and I'm so glad these came in quickly! Definitely recommended for good serving sizes of soups and other bowl friendly foods!"
"These are very nice bowls, seem pretty sturdy. They're a good size for a bowl of soup. They also work well as serving bowls for sides. Good buy."
Super happy with my purchase
Super cute bowls! I love a variety. Good quality.
"They are beautiful soup bowls. Just right size for Noodle soup, recommended."
This product is a college graduation gift for a family friend.
Lovely
"No paid me for this comment so here we go  I love these bowels and so do my kids. They are gorgeous and made so well. I have them with hot soup and the bowls heat retention makes the meal so much more enjoyable. My whole family has used it for cereal, pop corns, fruits , rice and one meal dish in it. I had intentionally bought it only for soup. But the family loves the way it feels and handle they do their best to get their hands on it. It’s a well love bowl The product came nicely package and carefully so there was no damages or chips. Our delivery guy pretty much sucks and throws my stuff around like he hates his job. These bowls survived his barbaric delivery Attitude."
"Purchased these bowls for serving Japanese Udon/Ramen or Korean Bibimbap. Sturdy and big, perfect portion for generous one serving. Priced lower than what I was able to find in local stores. Love the design, makes the food being served in them ‘pop’. Going to purchase a couple of more set when COVID19 is over and I can invite guests for a dinner party!! Can’t wait!!"
"Bowls arrived securely wrapped. So pretty and perfect for serving side dishes, or if you are eating a large salad or pasta. I use them all the time."
Purchased for a gift. They were packed very well for shipping. Color as pictured. Perfect size bowls for saimin or your favorite noodle dish. I may purchase a set for me.
Very nice design and shape. They are just what I had hoped they would be and look good with my other dishes. Excellent salad or noodle bowls.
"I got the 8 inch/35 ounce bowls. They're perfect for a big bowl of ramen. I've already accidentally banged them a couple of times, and they're still perfect. Come out of the dishwasher unharmed. Exactly what I was looking for. Also love all four designs, but especially the fish."
Bought two set and have used them daily for couple months. Very well made and perfect size for my needs.
I love my new bowls they are everything described . It was hard to find the size I wanted . I am pleased with the size .
These bowls are the perfect size for noodle dishes or as serving dishes for smaller portions. They came packaged very well. No flaws!
"Look as shown in the picture, pretty nice so far."
We loved the first set so much that we ordered a second!
"These are nice bowls. You can put plenty of soup in it. , Don’t let the shape fool you."
good bowl good quality
Perfect size for noodle soups! Not too big and not too small. Not too heavy or light. Highly recommend for everyday use.
"Quality seems good. Time will tell how durable they are but, they seem sturdy. Large enough for even noodles, salads, cereal, or anything else when you want in a large quantity. Very attractive."
totally recommend! I love these ramen plates
the best of the best
Excellent soup bowls. Beautiful pattern and good quality (so far).
"Great size, quality material, and very pretty. I would definitely buy them again."
Bought these for ramen and work out great. They are large enough to handle all the goodies we throw in our Ramen. The color and design are very pretty. Perfect for what we wanted.
The bowls are of very fine quality!
"These bowls are lightweight but not flimsy. They have not discolored or rusted at all, and they are dishwasher safe. I think these will last for a few years. I actually think that the sizes make sense- I've never needed to use anything bigger than the largest bowl included. Great starter kit for college students or young adults who are moving out."
"I was looking for lightweight stainless steel bowl to use for salads, chips etc. on the new porch so that when a guest reaches over for food and accidentally drops the bowl only the food will be lost! They are lightweight, so when full they would not be hard to carry and open two doors leading to porch enclosure. The bowls themselves are not uniform in weight, although this seems like it is on purpose. The larger the bowls have thicker and heavier gauge metal. the two smallest are ""thinner"". The smallest is good for beating an egg and the largest would hold a defrosting 4 lb chicken or a party size fruit salad...good sizes for most purposes. As to the quality of the stainless I cannot vouch, but they are shiny and unblemished (unused as yet), I don't expect them to stay that way forever, but then even my very good stainless steel pots develop some discoloration. They do look like it may be more like a good coating of stainless over some light metal...but good enuf for my purposes. I have china bowls for dinner parties and Rubbermade bowls for deep mixing, and mixmaster bowls came with the machine so these are perfect for quick mixing and porch and patio. One reviewer mentioned that they are too shallow, I did not think they were, although I was taken back when I saw the box and it only was about 6 inches deep. But the bowls compensate by being wide. As she suggested not great for mixing cake flour into batter. Think 3/4 bag+ of party size potato chips, salad for 6, egg salad, potato salad etc for buffets,(smaller sizes) dipping sauce and trail mix and you'll be able to assess their usefulness. These should definitely find a place in most kitchens.. you'll probably be reaching for them all the time, they're a breeze to clean, but they shouldn't be your only choice for all purposes. They nest well enuf so that they fit nicely in large kitchen drawer or on a shelf. Lids would have been nice (especially for the small ones) but mostly you would likely used smaller refrigerator dishes for storage. So if you're thinking about the don't hesitate! Will re-post if my impression changes."
"A little smaller than I thought, but I’m sure that was my own mental error, nonetheless they’re still solid mixing bowls for all size jobs. I’d buy these again in a heartbeat."
"My cooking needs are meager, but I needed a couple of mixing bowls. This set seemed to be an inexpensive solution. I don't know when I'll ever need all five bowls, but it's nice to have a selection to choose from.  One feature I just love is that these bowls nest together in the biggest bowl. They all fit in so they only take up the amount of space the big bowl takes up. That is a great feature in my cramped kitchen. Storage space is minimal. These bowls fit in nicely.  The bowls are lightweight. They feel as though they might not be very sturdy, but I don't honestly think that's a problem. I'm not going to be treating them too roughly. I think if I pushed too hard I might dent them... so I won't push too hard.  In the meantime, they're stainless steel and shiny, making it easy to clean up when I'm done.  Definitely would buy again, and would recommend."
Great set for the home baker. I use these daily and now want to get a couple bigger ones.
"Just what I needed in our fifth wheel - saves weight, easy to clean and store. Nice nesting set of stainless steel mixing bowls."
"The fact that many people said these were thin was actually a selling point for me. I live in a travel trailer so weight matters! These walk the line between lightweight and sturdy perfectly. The largest bowl pops in/out a tiny bit on the bottom but the smaller ones do not. Even with that I don’t see these breaking or anything in the foreseeable future. Probably a lifetime purchase, to be honest. Love the 5 sizes—perfect for cooking everything!"
I’m looking for balls like these for the last past 10 years have you been able to find any balls like this unless you buy them one by one and just wanna loan is anywhere from $19 to even more just one single bowl although I haven’t found the bowl that I was actually looking for the amount the quality or quantity of the bowls for the price keeps me very happy eventually I’ll find the balls that I want but right now these to the job more than anything.
"These make me feel like a pro, and help me organize while I’m cooking, which I love. They’re really lightweight but sturdy and strong. The only problem I really had is that if you put something warm and it gets really hot fast. So use oven mitts if you’re mixing something with hot water"
So glad I bought these. The sizes are perfect I use them all the time. They are easy to clean our durable for the dishwasher and a great price.
"Like everything about these bowls. Have not used my new ones yet, but I have two bowls just like these for over 30 years. I cleaned out old plastic bowls and wanted more stainless steel. Can't go wrong with these bowls."
Lightweight versatile perfect for wing night with multiple sauces. These bowls or not the heavy duty commercial grade but they are the best value for the price! We bought three sets
"I haven't used these bowls yet but just washed them. When I ordered these bowls, I didn't notice their depth or I would not have bought them. They are very shallow and I imagine batter flying everywhere when I use a hand mixer. They are shaped more like serving bowls and I don't serve food from stainless steel kitchen ware. The metal is a nice gauge, not too heavy or thin, and I'm sure they will last for years. I'm trying to decide whether to send them back or keep them."
These stink. They have a very moldy and chemical type smell. I've never bought anything stainless that stinks. I've stopped short of intentionally scratching them to see if the coating flakes off the surface. I definitely would not use these for food purposes.
I have found times when nothing works as well as a stainless steel bowl of a certain size. This nested assortment takes care of them all.
"These are sturdy, shiny, and professional. They have not rusted or bent in a few months of use, including dishwasher cleaning. I would recommend"
Stainless bowls are light and easy to clean. Got rid of all my heavy glass bowls
"I purchased these in my continuing attempt to un-plastic all my foodware. ...not much to say, they're bowls ... they stack nicely and are sturdy enough"
"These were a gift , for my sister. This is what she wanted for Christmas. She absolutely loves them. I am thinking about buying these for myself as well."
I like the fact that they stack and does not take much room.
I like that I can mix whatever I want and it doesn't stain the bowl. Very easy to clean.
"Absolutely wonderful. Easy to clean. Very durable and don't dent when using electric mixer. Although not made for table presentation , I have used them for meals that I set on dining cable"
"I luv this set, i know it's just a set of metal bowls, but they make me happy, warm and fuzzy while baking cookies."
So easy to store. I wish I had a set years ago. I like them so much that I bought another set for a friend.
Fácil de almacenar y para todo uso
"Love these bowls. I have used many time over the Christmas holiday. They are sturdy, shiny and very durable. Great buy."
Very wide and easy to use for meal prep and baking
Different sizes covers all the needs I have for Bowl usage. Easy to clean and Durable.
"It’s a really good product, affordable and very light weight. Im pretty happy with my purchase."
"These are really lightweight, but they are sturdy, true stainless steel and easy to clean."
Very Happy Overall

Love these light weight mixing bowls. Easy to clean and store.
"Very lightweight, easy to clean, a great set at a great price."
Good quality stainless bowls. All the sizes included are very useable.
"They are the best bowls, they are not super big, but they have perfect sizes."
"I love these so much, very sturdy and durable and they do not scratch."
My husband loves to cook & bake. Perfect gift for him. The item arrived the next day even during this busy season.
"There’s not much to dislike about these mixing bowls! The price point is great and they’re super sturdy! We cook on the grill a lot- brine chicken, marinate meat, mix burgers together, etc. and these are perfect!"
Could be a LITTLE more heavy duty. And I do really mean just a LITTLE lol. But overall perfect for personal use and you can’t beat the price.
"I cook about every meal and needed extra bowls for mixing, prep, etc. and these have been perfect. Light, store well, easy to clean also perfect for popcorn. I now use them daily."
Love them
Love these. Metal is better than ceramic for working with eggs & other liquids. These are perfect and a great value
Great quality
Makes baking easier
I love these bowls because they can be put in the dishwasher and they’re very sturdy
"As expected, good for the price. I’ve used them almost daily for a month now and dishwasher, and they hold up."
Love the sizes and easy to handle
Great Bowls 100% worth it. I chose no lids because I dislike the clutter and I don’t find any need for them
I liked them!
"Nice flat bottom, lightweight, would buy again"
I got these because I needed new mixing bowls that were easy to clean and store. They are exactly what I was going for.
"This stainless steel mixing bowls were exactly the sizes i was looking for, and they are great qualityy!"
Perfect stainless steel bowls. Great value
Very sturdy!
One of the best things I've ever purchased on amazon. I use them daily.
These bowls are awesome!
Came just as described and they’re durable!!!
"I love them. I do tons of baking and they are perfect. It is nice to have all the sizes, and they are easy to clean."

good value for the money
"Love using these in the Kitchen...Easy to clean, Easy to store, light perfect for baking"
Worth the money to pay.
great love them ... !
Bowls are as described.
Was everything I expected and more!
"This bowel helps produce a Hot luxurious lather!!! First, I intended to review this bowl a long time ago, but I wanted to be sure I gave it the thorough review it deserves. The first bowl I received had a beautiful marble pattern, but it had a crack that was obviously patched at the factory. I contacted Beau Brummell, and a gentleman named Daniel requested a photo of this unusual occurrence. He immediately acknowledged that this was unacceptable, and sent me a replacement. They even allowed me to keep the bowl! It makes an attractive change bowl on the mantle. I call this superior customer service! Thank you Daniel.  The replacement bowl wasn't quite as pretty as the first, but is still nice (luck of the draw). Now, let me tell you, this bowl is heavy and retains heat extremely well to produce a nice HOT lather!!! I love it! See the pic. That temp probe was in the lather, and not touching the bowl. It went much higher when I touched the bowl (I have to hold it with a wash towel). I just ran Hot water into the bowl (yes my hot water is HOT!!) for a minute, poured most out, and started whipping. It feels SO good, to rub that into my beard!!! The only con for this bowl is, those rings on the inside are kind of rough, so if you have a pretty /expensive brush, you might scratch the HECK out of it if your not careful. Other than that minor problem, I LOVE THIS BOWL!!! Buy one NOW, and enjoy the same hot lather that I do!!"
"The top rated reviews are accurate! This pure marble shaving bowl with inner ribbed lines make for a warm and easy to lather shave. The bowl is slightly smaller than I thought from some reviewers pictures but that’s actually perfect for me and my bathroom. I can easily hold the bowl while shaving if needed and it also fits inside my bathroom cabinet at it’s current size. It is marble so don’t drop it or choose to just use it as is while sitting on your bathroom countertop. As far as shaving bowls go, after purchasing many various ones over the years I’d easily say this is my favorite. The material is high quality marble, the natural coloring of the marble is beautiful and ideal for me and my bathroom and it’s function as a shave bowl works as well as any I’ve used, if not better. If you’re looking for a marble shave bowl, spend the little bit extra on this Beau Brummell marble shave bowl and you will not be disappointed! Their customer service has also been quite good with any questions I had. Happy shaving!"
"Moved and lost (misplaced?) my shaving mug and finally got around to searching for a new one. I am pretty picky about this type of stuff, so I wanted something that wasn’t cheap looking, had a classy feel to it, and worked well. This shaving soap bowl achieves all of that.  It is remarkably heavy in the hand (which is a good thing) and looks great sitting by my sink. But nice appearance only counts if it works, and this bowl is exceptional. The inside is textured just perfectly to build a great lather when rotating the brush over it. The heavy marble like material hold the heat wonderfully. The result is a huge amount of hot foam both on the brush and in the bowl.  You poor people that spend money on shaving cream in cans/tubes just do not know what you are missing. Get this bowl, get some nice shaving soap, run some warm water into this thing and work up a great hot lather. It is life changing."
"Extremely happy with this product! This shave bowl has a fantastic visual aesthetic, even better than it appears in the pictures.  The size is exactly what I was looking for; it fits perfectly in my hand, with a good weight to it, and I really appreciate how deep the bowl is. I like to soak my brush in the bowl before I shave, and I have found many bowls are too shallow to allow soaking, as the bristles are not covered all the way. This bowl is not only wide enough to lather while still fitting comfortably in the hand, it is also deep enough for me to completely submerg the brush bristles while soaking.  I read some reviews that mentioned it was slippery to hold when wet, however, I completely disagree. The marble it is made from has a finish on the exterior that does not get slippery at all. Unless completely covered in soap, even when very wet this bowl has a good friction to it, allowing a sturdy grasp. No worries of slipping out of your hand.  I am extremely satisfied with this bowl. Would definitely recommend, and am very impressed especially considering how inexpensive it is. Great customer service, arrived early, and well packed to protect from breaking en route. Five stars"
"The Beau Brummell Solid Marble Shaving Soap Bowl is amazing. The ridges inside make soap foaming a breeze. Hint 1 fill with hot water and let it sit for 60 seconds, fill again and let it sit for another 60 seconds. you will have the warmest soap foam you have ever had for shaving, besides at a legit barber maybe. the Bowl fits well in your hand and has hefty enough weight to swirl your brush on the counter as well. I feel it is hefty enough that if I dropped it I would lose a toe before it was damaged. however, if it did break I would be ordering another one immediately. Yes its a bit higher priced than some others but I believe it is worth it, in every way. I cannot see you being disappointed with the Beau Brummell shaving bowl if you want the best tool for the job."
"This was my first bowl purchase and a nice one at that. Pros; 1. Marble takes well to hot water and retains the heat for a warm lather, 2. Ridges inside the bowl makes this bowl a lather machine, 3. A nice looking bowl, 4. Substantial weight feels solid, 5. Bottom of the bowl is just the right size to cup in hand as I create a lather.  Cons; 1. Not a travel bowl because of the material and weight, 2. Inside of the mouth opening has a squared edge instead of being rounded, makes for an uncomfortable feeling when your fingers hit the edge of the bowl when making a lather. 3. Mouth opening is somewhat small compared to other bowls, does not lend itself to be used with large (wide) brush handles, narrow brush handles work fine.  I love this bowl and when I'm using my Parker Black Badger Brush it is my goto bowl. I love the fact that this bowl retains heat and has a nice heft. A great addition to anyone's shave den."
"I have previously purchased two shaving bowls and used several bowls and mugs I have for coffee and food but at last have found what I was looking for. This is a superb shaving bowl in that it retains heat while whipping up a great lather from my soap or cream with my shaving brush. I often get as many as three applications in one shave and by the third the warmth has dissipated, but warmth isn't the only great feature. The texture inside the bowl is exactly what I need to get that great lather. It was a wonderful surprise to get lather from creams I have used previously that were nowhere near as rich. I did have to experiment with the quantity of hot water used and I found more was better than less. Is it good for travel? If you don't mind the heft its fine. I wouldn't take it backpacking but then I wouldn't be shaving on a backpack trip either. This is a wonderful shaving bowl and I heartily endorse it!"
"First of all, the packaging is well done, well protected for shipping. I got this for my son, who knew there must be more to life than shaving cream from a can, but he didn't know what. I selected a shaving soap and then I started researching bowls. This was everything the description promised it would be. It is in itself a handsome piece, but the real beauty of it lies in its ability to hold heat on a chilly winter morning. If you do as the instructions say, fill it with hot water while you are showering so the stone can heat up, you will be rewarded with the most luxurious shave you have ever had. My son is very satisfied, he has found what he didn't know he was looking for. The only reason I gave it four stars for travelling is the weight (it is made of marble, after all), but size-wise it can pack easily among clothes without taking up much room."
"Replaced another bowl that wasn’t the right dimensions for getting a nice lather with my brush. As it happens my hand was just a bit too big and my old bowl was just a bit too deep for proper brush movement.  This bowl feels like it will last a very long time, has a surprising weight about and fits quite nice in the hand. It’s not too deep or too wide. Perfect.  I shave in the shower so word of caution: you would certain not want to drop this thing as it would surely cause some pain if it whacked your foot on the way down...it’s that substantial.  I don’t see how you could wrong if this model interests you."
Works great! The ridges really help lather up shaving cream. The heat retention properties of the bowl adds an amazing feel. Looks very high end.  Like: Looks & feels very high end Spacious bowl Ridges inside bowl work to lather quickly Heat retention works as described Provides a rich warm lather  Dislike: Had a temporary terrible foul smell (had to soak in soapy water for 30 minutes then air dried in direct sunlight to finally get rid of the bad smell). Bowl had sandy residue left all over bowl and inside the packaging. Textured ridges may scratch brushes if not careful.  Neutral: Expensive. May be too large for some.
"I tend to over analyze everything by reading far too many product descriptions and reviews before selecting anything on Amazon and this bowl was no exception. Some of the reviews were helpful but others make me wonder if they really bought the same bowl. I like natural products so part of my choice was this bowl is made of marble. Besides liking how it looks I also knew that unlike a metal bowl, marble would not potentially leave rust stains my counter. I was also influenced by the product description and reviews which mentioned heat retention. I am very pleased with my selection and want to point out areas where I agree and disagree with some of the other reviews: -Yes, it is heavy. You should expect that from natural stone and I didn't buy this as a travel item -If you run hot water on the bowl it will retain heat and you'll get a warm shave. -It is certainly large enough to do the job. -I don't care if there is no rubber bottom to keep it from sliding around during use because I hold it in my hand. -Yes, the groves in the marble seem to help froth up the brush. -No, the groves are not sharp and have not damaged my brush after several uses.  Bottom line, I like it and would buy another one if something happens to it. But considering it is as solid as a rock (literally), I doubt I'll need another. So if you want a solid bowel that will retain heat and look good sitting on your counter, you've found a good option."
This is a great product. I was looking for a new shaving bowl since the stainless steel one I had for only a few month started to rust. Marble! That does not rust. This bowl has a solid feel when you hold it. The look is luxurious. The outside is smooth and feels nice in the hand. The inside is rough and has carved ridges that help whip up a satisfying lather. You can heat the bowl under hot water prior to lathering for a warm foam. It works! A definite buy if you are looking for a top end luxurious shaving bowl. It won’t disappoint.
"Good lord this thing is one magnificent piece of manufacturing. The bowl is well constructed and heavy enough to not move when resting on the bathroom counter. The weight also feels good in your hand when you are mixing your soap and is not uncomfortable to hold.  The textured interior threw me off at first, but I quickly realized that it allows you to generate a better lather in the bowl as opposed to a standard smooth surface. The bowl itself is also well-designed and looks great as a design piece.  Combine all of this at an affordable price and this is more than worth the purchase."
"This shaving bowl surprised me. I was going to buy a double walled stainless bowl, but this one just looked so much nicer. I heat it up under running hot water and it holds the heat almost all the way through a three pass shave with a safety razor. It has little rides on the inside which help to create a nice lather, yet the bowl is easy to clean.  If you're a shaving enthusiast, or just want a nice hot lather, give it a shot. I highly recommend this product."
"With the same shaving cream and with the same razor but with this bowl (instead of another one), the shave experience is dramatically better - producing a better lather and getting a better shave. I cannot imagine getting a better lather -- would likely get a better shave with a different razor. Definitely , the bowl s able to retain water heat and whatever coarseness is there on the inside is perfect for producing a good lather. Even when I have by mistake left too much water on the brush, the lather still comes out a lot better than with the prior bowl. But, now I know how much moistness to leave behind on the brush and I get a perfect lather. Holds my brush comfortably; the size of the bowl is perfect for my brush (I will update with the size of the brush soon). For best results, I fill the bowl with hot (hottest) water. Soak the brush with hot water and leave the brush in the bowl for 15 to 30 minutes. Then squeeze and shake to get most of the water out of the brush. Add Nivea cream to the bowl and generate awesome lather. Looks good, is heavy (but not extremely heavy), fits well in my hand. Could it/should it have been priced lower? I think, yes. But I knew how much I was paying for it and I am totally satisfied. Hence no hesitation in giving it five stars."
"First, I want to put in a caviat about Travel. This is a heavy bowl. I will not take it traveling. I have lighter bowls for travel. It says that it soaks up heat and that is sure does. It is a pleasure shaving with it and always having nice warm lather. I fill a sink with hot water and let it soak. I give it at least two trips to the sink. I have tried a lot of Lather Bowls in my search for the best one. This Marble Bowl ranks #1!"
"Is it on sale right now? If so, buy it. If not, probably still buy it.  Pros: -Looks great -Holds heat if you throw some hot water in it before using -Grooves make lathering quick and easy -...that's it. It's a shaving bowl. Just a really great one.  Cons: -You won't want to travel with this (one of the ""Features"" for rating on here). It's a good size and pretty heavy."
"This is the perfect shaving bowl; exactly what I was hoping it would be. It holds warmth well, has enough roughness inside to ensure excellent lathering, and it is sooooooo handsome. Best to warm the bowl with really hot water inside and out for several minutes to ensure that the stone heats throughly (you can soak your brush at the same time). The stone is porous so it will absorb stronger scents from your soap, so keep that in mind. It adds a timeless aesthetic den vibe... Love it."
"Bought this after trying a few others. While it is not good for traveling, due to its seriously heavy mass, that is always what helps it retain warmth for generating a great lather. The thing won't be going anywhere as you rub your brush along the ridges. The ridges themselves help to make a good lather quickly, and I use them to spread the soap across easily without it sticking to my fingers to make the lather even quicker. Best shaving product that I have ever bought. It seems durable as well, but it has olny been a few months, so only time will tell.  UPDATE: This bowl has held up perfectly for coming on a year now. At this point I won't hesitate to give it a firm recommendation. Nothing has chipped and the ridges have not worn. It retains heat well in addition."
"This is a very substantial shaving bowl. Nice and heavy, beautiful marble. The ridges on the inside create extra friction while whipping up the soap to create an impressive lather. Great heat retention to keep the lather nice and warm."
"I purchased this shaving bowl some weeks ago after looking at comparable products and reading through a lot of reviews. This has exceeded my expectations. To be honest, this was a luxury buy. I had a small ceramic bowl that I previously used, but I felt it was slightly too small. This bowl is beautiful, well-crafted, well-designed, sturdy, and a great size. It's large enough to hold the lather but fits nicely in the palm of your hand. The marble retains heat exceptionally well. I fill it with hot water for a few minutes before use and I'm always impressed by how warm it keeps the lather. The ridges on the inside of the bowl really help to work up a lather with a shaving brush.  I've never actually reviewed a product on Amazon before now, but I am going out of my way because this bowl has really made shaving a joy. 10/10 recommend buying this beautiful bowl."
Don't even bother with another Soap Bowl!  I tried multiple other products that honestly didn't live up to what this product delivers each and every day. Fits great in the palm of my hand. Enough weight to let me know I'm about to have a man's shave. It provides just the right amount of friction to help the soap reach it's ultimate lather. The marble construction is perfect for maintaining the temperature I want..
"Certainly a good lather with this bowl due to the texture in the bowl (which not to mention is solid and heavy). In about 7 clockwise swirls with your brush, you will get a pretty thick lather (mind you, I was using shaving gel rather than soap which in which i would never imagine getting a thick lather)."
"The bowl is absolutely great. It retains heat significantly better than the ceramic lather bowl I have, and it looks amazing. The interior shape of the bowl is perfect for whipping up a larger because the mouth is wider than the foot which is not the case with all bowls unfortunately.  The only downside is the white marble makes it a little harder to see the condition of your lather than a darker bowl would, but this definitely isn't a deal break."
"This bowl is heavy and stays put, not sliding around the vanity. The texture on the inside helps to make an excellent lather. It holds temperature well, so if the room where you shave is cold, you'll want to fill it with hot water and let it sit for a bit before putting the shave soap in (assuming you want a warm lather)."
"This bowl is excellent for keeping heat for a good period of time until the shaving is over, great size fitting in hand, it is a foaming machine! * The image of the bottom is not a crack, it is a vein of alabaster :) happy with it"
"For me, warm shaving cream is a key to success. I drop this beautifully constructed piece of marble in a sink full of hot water before I shower.  When it’s time to shave you have nice warm shaving cream start to finish. I can only imagine this is similar to what ancient Roman sculptures used when they shaved."
"It’s marble, it’s heavy, it holds the heat after using hot water to warm it up before adding/whipping the shaving soap. Perfect size. Looks very nice on the counter. It’ll last a lifetime with care."
"Going from a small stainless steal bowl that came with my brush to this is huge. I do soak it in hot water for 60 seconds as per instructions. The bowl is pretty big compared to my small bowl. So you have to do bigger rotations with the brush, but the heated marble bowl with grooves on the inside. Makes it easy to form shaving cream in half the time. P.S. The only reason I write this review is because, there aren't many reviews out there for this shaving bowl thing."
"I've tried a variety of mugs and bowls and this is my favorite. I can put hot water into it while I shower and it is very warm by the time I'm out of the shower. It will keep lather warm for two passes of the razor,  The bowl has scores on the inside that make whipping up a lather super easy. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. I like it even better than the granite bowl I had been using before this. Definitely a keeper."
"This shaving bowl is amazing, keep it under hot running water for a minute and it will give you a nice and warm foam. The size of the bowl is relatively large so it is very easy to use it with any soap. What I do is I put a soap on the bottom of it and make a foam on top of it. I do not take out the soap until I finish it - so I use it also to keep the soap inside. The disadvantage of this bowl is its weight and durability. It is so heavy that I am worried that it will break my floor if I will drop it accidentally - so it requires your attention while shaving. You can not put it on the edge of the sink just because you are scared about the consequences of it being dropped. Obviously it will crush into pieces if it will fall breaking both itself and the floor. The bottom part of the bowl - the one that is in contact with the shelf is slippery. If you put it on a wet surface it slides on it as on the ice skates. This is definitely not a traveling product. If you have to travel with it make sure to wrap it the same way you would wrap a crystal glass. Besides it I use it every day and very happy with that"
This bowl is large and heavy in a good way. If you take care of this bowl it will last for decades. No joke. My only concern is if it falls from the counter it will either break your foot or tile. The bowl holds the temperature of hot water if you want a hot/warm shave. Just a heads up the store with walls in its name has the same bowl/same seller for $8 cheaper.
"This marble shaving soap bowl is awesome. I was looking for a soap bowl to make a nice lather for my shaving soap and after doing a lot of research of similar products, I believe this is the best purchase for your money if this is in your price point. The bowl generates a nice soap lather for your brush and it holds its heat rather well. I thoroughly enjoy this product and enjoy how well its looks too! Highly recommend this product!"
"The bowl was hefty, which was the big thing for me. I was expecting something thinner that felt like it could break in your hands, instead I feel like I could smash this into the side of a bears head then use it afterwards. The fact it is possibly the classiest thing I now own is a bonus."
"This bowl looks amazing and easy to make good lather. It's a solid marble, easy to heat and make your lather worm. It came well packed and not damaged. I hope it's really made in India and will last for years."
"I just received this Bowl and really like it, so far. I believe a marble bowl holds the heat of the shaving cream much better than a porcelain one that I've used for the past 15 years. I really like the weight. It is a product that is described as it is designed. I would have no problem considering other products they sell."
"The packaging was excellent. I was a little concerned because the bowl is marble. When I opened the box, Wow this bowl is heavy and it's a beauty. I used my silver-tipped badger brush and some Mudder Focker shaving cream. I put hot water into the bowl to heat it up prior to lathering the MF. The results were excellent. This marble bowl is worth the money. Thank you BB."
I originally bought a stainless steel bowl. But my Parker badger brush was so heavy it kept trying to fall over. This marble bowl has some heft to it. I fill it with hot water in the sink while I shower. Then use it to shave after. Very classy.
Very heavy. just what I was looking for. A little larger than I thought but I am very happy with my purchase.
"Builds a great lather no matter the soap; very heavy, though - not really designed for traveling. Better than using some plastic cup or bowl 🥣"
This product keeps shave cream warm. I fill it with water and put in the microwave for 90 seconds and soak my brush in it. Lathers well. I don't know about travel since I have only used it at home. Would purchase again if something happened to it.
Large and heavy. When you warm it up under some hot water for about 40 seconds before you add the shaving cream you get them most wonderful warm foam. The design is perfect for creating a lot of foam. Cleans easily.
I bought this for my fiancé and he absolutely loves it. It’s a very sturdy bowl and heavy. Perfect for on top of a vanity or bathroom counter. It has these cool ridges around it too make a nice lather with a brush. It also looks really expensive and fancy. Just what I was looking for. Beautiful and great product!
"Outside is smooth, inside is rough/textured - works great and looks great. Me like and wifey like. Goodness!"
Pretty bowl to hold water while shaving if you face lather. It's nice to use for bowl lathering too. Holds heat well if you preheat then add hot water.
Easy to clean has small ridges in bowl whips up a great foam for shaving using small amounts. Looks great on my grey counter as well.
"My husband loves this bowl. He says it’s a “game changer.” It’s very heavy, which could be a problem with wet hands, but he hasn’t dropped it yet. Overall, he prefers this over a metal or wood bowl."
It is heavy just don’t drop on your foot or tile but it gets hot when you let hot water run in it the shaving cream lather up so good I am happy with it
Nice heavy bowl. Holds the heat. Some what big for a travel mug and no cover.
A good rustic bowl with just enough grind ridges in the marble to make a good lather. It would be a little large and heavy for traveling
"Fantastic shave bowl, very worth the money, after soaking it in hot water it retains heat very well. I like the weight and the ridges inside do a great job of lathering. My shave bowl for many years to come."
this is a nice bowl and it really works up a lather
"Beautiful white marble, heavy little bowl that fits in the hand and retains the heat. Don't drop it, keep it dry and this stone will serve you a long time."
the bowl is large enough and gets warm really quick. Good agitation for making a great lather. Heavy duty.
"I love my bowl! Keeps my shaving lather warm and is easier to use than a traditional cup. I was afraid that I might not be able to hold it but despite its weight, it fit nicely in my hand."
"It is heavier than I expected and is wider than I expected, so it doesn't fit exactly where I had intended to leave it. Therefore I will probably buy a small shower shelve once I find one not made in China.  However, it does a great job of creating a warm lather with very little Cremo shave cream. I would buy it again.  No rating for travelling because it is not intended for travel use."
"Another minor game changer for my daily shaving routine that upgrades my quality of life. For anyone that uses a shaving brush, this bowl is a must."
"This is a beautiful and practical thing (makes great lather) that will can last 100 lifetimes. I think that most shaving bowls are a rip off, but this one is worth the money."
"Love this soap bowl. It's heavy, solid and beautiful. Good size. Holds heat well for nice hot lather"
This thing is well made. It's real. It's heavy. It's one solid piece. Perfect size and thick walls. My expectations were definitely exceeded.
"I have used this bowl for about 6 months now and I will say it makes a difference. The contours along the inside help to generate a nice lather quickly, and the bowl itself is a nice width. Very nice-looking bowl, as well. Many items look and/or feel cheap when you actually receive them, but not this bowl. Nice weight and texture."
"Does its job well and looks nice on my counter. Lets me whip up a good lather and is easy to wash out clean after. Made of solid Marble, it is heavy, which I consider a good thing. All in all a good product at a reasonable price."
With the textured interior it was very easy to generate a thick lather. It also held the heat well and is very easy to clean. It is a little heavy but given the material it is to be expected so just need to take care when handling. Overall very satisfied with purchase!
"I brought this bowl because I wanted something unique! I’ve used it three times now & it works beautifully, I Soak it in hot water for a couple minutes & put my shaving cream in & it warms up the cream. It’s easy to clear up as well!"
Solidly crafted. Very elegant. Serves it's purpose quite well.
Very nice print on the marble. Heavy construction allows heat retention by running hot water for about 40 seconds. Grooves inside the bowl help build up a great lather that is hot because the bowl retained its heat even after the second lather pass.
Love this bowl. It's as beautiful as it is functional.
I like the looks and feel of the bowl. The ridges inside the bowl help hold the soap in place
I have only used Bigelow cream but I am sure there are others that work well with this bowl. Smooth Marble on the outside but rough on the inside to foam shaving cream. Works great.
Great lathering bowl. Whips it up @ nano speed!
"My wife and I regularly cook meals with rice as the main carb element and many of these dishes benefit from being able to lay down a bed of rice at the bottom of the bowl followed by laying the stew/sauce/veggies on the top of the rice. Many of the standard bowls you can get at grocery stores are a bit too shallow, great for a bowl of cereal or tomato soup, but not large enough to contain a full multi-element meal. The kind of meal that benefits from putting it together in the bowl. These S&Q bowls fit that role perfectly and I would highly recommend.  They have been through my dishwasher a few times and have performed admirably. They are also a beautiful pattern and are nice and sturdy."
"These bowls are beautiful and are a great size! They work well for rice dishes, ramen, cereal, ice cream, popcorn; you name it, it’s a great bowl for it! I love that they arrived to be quickly and that they come in a set of 4! I got them in black and they’re so pretty. Will definitely purchase from this brand again. Highly recommend! (See photos for hand/bowl size reference."
"I like larger portions, in salads, cereal, most everything. I've been looking for a larger bowl that was was between a serving bowl, and a traditional bowl size, and this one is great. The stoneware had a bonus in that it is also oven safe, which I was not expecting. The texture of the bowl is good for handling, while the edges are smooth for drinking the remaining milk from cereal or broth from soups. I'm not easily impressed, but this was the best bowl set I've bought in my (admittedly long) life. I highly and whole heartedly recommend!"
"These bowls have a textured finish, but a smooth feel to the surface. Same size as the beige ones we bought afew months ago. I shattered one on the patio, hence the need for a replacement. Liked the blue better, so why not. They hold up well in the mic, sink, dishwasher, general kitchen use. Just can't treat'em like a basketball. They are, afterall, ceramic. Same excellent packing like the last set."
"These are nicer than I expected and clean up easily. They go through the dishwasher with no problems, even though their surface is textured. Good size for a breakfast bowl. Would buy from them again. If I need to replace any other dishware in future, I'll look for this brand. Impressive for the price."
They are HUGE great for soups and cereal and any LARGE PORTIONS and I love the color
These were a gift for my brother. He loves them. They hold a lot. Heavy and sturdy bowls.
Easy to clean and does not stain with Tomato based foods. Great for salad or cereal. I ordered a set for my son! He came over to my house and was very impressed with the bowls! He and family love the size!!!
"I love these bowls because they look great, they're easy to clean, and they're very solid. They were exactly what I was hoping for, and I liked them so much that I ordered another set."
Very Nice and sturdy bowls. I like the texture of the bowls. Would buy again.
"The bowls are perfect! They are very sturdy and thick--great for chili, cereal, salads, fruit, and anything you need for something deep and wide. They have a speckled, shiny finish I wasn't expecting that makes them even better! They are very beautiful. I wish I had ordered another set. These are awesome!"
"Great deep bowl, love eating big bowls of soup, this bowl has enough room for a full can with plenty of room for crackers etc"
"It was going to get 5 stars across the board, until this morning is when noticed a small chip on the rim of the bowl! Trust me I wanted to cry when I saw it."
Purchased for sons knew place. He loves them! Great size for big bowl of cereal or salad!
"Nice sized, sturdy bowls. Not meant for small portions"
"High quality, beautiful aesthetics the right dimensions to make them perfect for many types of food and uses."
A little too heavy
The bowls are high quality and look nice. I got the blue ones.
"these are beautiful, large well made bowls."
The bowls hold water.
"These bowls are prettier, larger and better quality than I had expected from the description. Recommend!"
"Thank you S&Q Ceramics for these larger bowels i like them very much ! Just what i needed for cereal, soup and much more!"
Bowls are great
These bowls arrived in perfect condition. Beautiful dark and light blue. We love the size of them!! We even use them for small serving bowls. I just hope they don't chip. So far so good
Love these bowls. They are the perfect large sized breakfast or soup bowl. Quality is very good and very sturdy. And they look great !!
"Great quality, bigger than I was expecting, but love them."
The bowls were extremely well packaged. Their sizes were fairly similar. maybe just a tiny difference noted. The finish was slightly different on one of the bowls but not terribly noticeable. All in all a good purchase.
"Not wide enough for Italian pasta but Great for most Soup Supping Italian or otherwise. My Wife pots and she complemented their design, heft, stability and capacity. You can balance the bowls on your lap in bed while watching nightly news slurping Chinese noodle soups. Love them so far. I can't imagine they'll shatter at a hasty clean-up. Sweet, Very Sweet Bowls."
Very Satisficed!
"These are nice bowls, would be perfect for cereal, oatmeal, noodles, soup, etc. But they are 6 1/2 "" wide, so they wouldn't fit in two rows in the cabinet where I wanted them to go. I returned them with no difficulty."
"I like the size ,but find it hard to get soup out of it . Steep sides."
"Great bowls, but package was missing one bowl from the set of 4."
These are not my favorite. A terrible heat and smell comes off of them when microwaved. They have a texture that is funny.
"One of the bowls arrived chipped, unusable."
great addition to our cupboard
"Beautiful bowls, hold a hearty helping of whatever you wish and shipped in a box with fitted foam so no worries about damage!"
"These bowls are so versatile. The quality exceeds what I was expecting. You won’t regret buying these. They’re ideal for salads, pasta, soups, and cereal; both cold as well as hot."
Love the size of these bowls we use them for ramen primarily but also soup and cereal etc. Love the large size makes it easy to fit noodles and veggies and meat all in one bowl!
"These bowls are perfect. They’re beautiful, strong and the perfect portion size."
"These bowls are a fairly good size and deep enough to fit ramen, broth and toppings. They were made well and pretty sturdy, with a beautiful Japanese appeal. Love that it comes in a set of 4, which is perfect for family and/or friends. I've used them not only for ramen, but for other noodle soups, congee and rice and will be storing them in my cabinet for a while!"
"Excellent packaging, there was no way these would have broken in shipment Absolutely awesome bowls. Definitely will order from this vendor again!"
Very durable
"The bowl set is great, and sturdy."
"These bowls came with perfect package. There is no way to break during shipment thanks to their careful packing. The bowls are Japanese style, very sturdy and wider than my expectation. Good fit for ramen, soup, cereal."
"I would have given it 5 stars for the packing alone. I always order dishes and think they’ll arrive chipped or broken. Each bowl was surrounded by soft styrofoam (I’m not sure what it’s called) and then stuck together and tightly packed in its box. I feel like I could drop this off a four story building and it would bounce. The bowls themselves are sturdy, cool looking and deep. I got the 36 ounce bowls and it will easily hold two packs of ramen, and you would not be able to finish your cereal before it got soggy if you filled it. These are by far my favorite bowls. I wish they made matching plates and cups. I’ve ordered so much stuff for my new house and this is one of the few things that didn’t disappoint."
I was impressed by the shipping packaging as it was packaged to prevent any cracking during shipment. These bowls are super cute and worth the price! Love them!
"I've been searching for bowls like the ones I got years ago, these are close, these will work. I was hoping for a little deeper and not as wide but like other reviews, I like the larger portion bowls. Like other reviews there's mistakes in manufacturing, you'd expect to find items like this at TJ Max, because that's what they sell, non perfect items. The defects are in the painting of the bowls where the sprayer missed. Not a huge deal for me, I won't be setting a table with these bowls."
i think i really found the right products for myself and what to easily level up my life experience. my recommendation for you guys also!
"This ceramic bowl is a good choice for salad, pasta, soup and pho. It looks good and has a large capacity. It is worth mentioning that the material of this product is good, because I took the bowl. When the hand will not be scalded by the hot food"
These are really nice and really big bowls. Exactly what I was looking for
They are beautiful and sturdy. A great addition to my kitchen. I’m very happy I got them and I am even considering getting a second set. They seem to be pretty sturdy. I have put them on the dishwasher many times now a d so far so good!
"I had been worried about buying these because I was unsure if they'd survive the journey, due to their fragility. I was surprised to find that the box they arrived in was completely filled with Styrofoam and the inside contents were gently nestled and secured, entirely unharmed. Though they appear small, they can definitely accommodate a sizeable portion of food. I definitely recommend these!"
"Love these bowls. A good buy. Look really nice, color is great, and good quality."
"I love these bowls! My husband I just bought them to complement our white dishes, and they are GORGEOUS. Well made, I love the pattern. Dishwasher / Microwave safe. A good size too - Not too big, not too small. Would definitely recommend. When we move into a larger place and need more place settings, I'll definitely be buying more of these."
"Great, just what I needed and they are durable,easy to clean and sturdy. Very attractive which was also important to me. Very pleased."
"Needed larger bowls for soup, salads, etc. These are excellent quality, very sturdy, and dishwasher safe. Love the dark blue color also."
Nice color and good size.
Great for soup and cereal. I love the colors. You will love these bowls.
love it
Bowls have a good feel.
Great bowls at a good price!
"They do not get too hot in microwave like many other bowls, very nicely made."
Beautiful bowl. Dishwasher safe.
"These bowls are so pretty. Very thick, easy to clean! Would buy again."
Loved the design and price
Fashionable and sturdy with the size/volume I was looking for.
"Maybe fine as a cereal bowl, but can't really be used in the microwave"
These cereal bowls have exceeded my original expectation. They are the perfect size for most things you would use a bowl for. I love the colors of them too. I chose the ones that fade from white to dark blue. I have washed them multiple times by hand and in the dishwasher. They are great quality and came packaged really well. I was concerned since they were glass they might get broken in transit however that wasn't an issue at all. There was a styrofoam base and each bowl was well wrapped. I am very happy with this bowl set I will absolutely purchase more from this store.
"These are sturdy, and the size is ideal for a hearty bowl of soup or cereal. The color is traditional white, and they match my Lennox china perfectly. The outer design is raised/textured and timeless. No problems with the dishwasher or microwave."
"These are sturdy, attractive bowls. One of their uses indicated was cereal bowl, which is what I wanted them for. However, they are a little too large for a cereal bowl, at least for me. They do have many uses , such as storing leftovers, using for large individual salads or pasta bowls, chips and popcorn etc. You will definitely find uses for them in your kitchen."
"I love these bowls. I use them for oatmeal in the morning and for other foods needing a bowl, not a plate. This is mostly heating in the microwave and they don’t get too hot to touch."
"They were just what I was looking for: the interior is smooth and functional, the outside pattern is raised enough to look and feel nice but not cause any issues with cleaning. The bowls are also slightly larger than indicated -- more like 28 or 29 ounces -- which was a pleasant surprise. Just the right size for soup, cereal, and general use."
My friend has these bowls and we used them every day while we were visiting her house. I had to buy my own set when I got home. They are a great size and so versatile for serving or eating. They stack great for storing and are easy to hand wash or run through the dishwasher.
Right size for cereal and soup. Sturdy and do not appear they would chip easily. Would recommend for anyone needing larger bowls with many uses.
"I really love the look of these. Simple but interesting. They're nice and deep, so great for soups and cereal. They feel sturdy and well made. They've gone through my dishwasher dozens of times now with no problems."
"The bowls are lovely and just right size for making one-bowl meals, but they arrived with one broken. Tried to contact the seller, but no dice."
"It looks sturdy and super useful for large dishes. I like colors and design very much. There is enough space for salads and dishes, otherwise they may stick out or fall off the plate. It is a good choice for people who like to eat a lot of vegetables. I also like that bowl."
"Can't attest to their use as they were a gift, but the recipient loved them and they are just as beautiful as they appear onscreen. I recommend them, and the price is excellent."
"These are my favorite bowls. Easy to clean, sturdy, and has a beautiful embossed design on the outside. They do not scratch from utensil use."
Bowls have a nice weight to them and work great for cereal
These are attractive bowls. I like the size. I’m not sure how long they will last around my clumsy household member but we like them and are hoping for the best.
"Gorgeous blue color and the perfect size bowl. I just got these and have already used them for cereal, soup and ice cream. They even can be used as a serving bowl for side dishes."
"I just received these bowls today. They're beautiful, and I look forward to using them. However, these feel more like stoneware/ceramic than porcelain. They are noticably thicker (probably twice as thick) and heavier than rest of my white porcelain dishes Also, compared to my white dishes, the lightest color in this set is definitely more of an off white."
"The design and colors are what drew us in, but we are thrilled with how sturdy these bowls are, too. They feel substantial and can be easily thrown in the dishwasher for cleanup. They look great in person, to boot!"
"Great for eating out of or just for part of a centerpiece, these bowls are both beautiful and highly functional. The ceramic adapts well to temperature and it’s smooth, durable structure makes it easy to clean. Highly recommend!"
I got the white which is not a true white but I love the shape and design. I’m glad I bought them.
"These bowls are a great shape, style, and feel sturdy. My only complaint is they are NOT white and I bought them in white expecting it to be brighter but it’s definitely ivory so they don’t match my other dishes."
Love these bowls. I am considering order another set even though I don't need one.
"I really like this set of bowls, but I thought they were larger than they appear. Still a nice set"
Very attractive and well-made bowls.
I was looking for bigger bowls that were dishwasher safe. These are great abs they look really nice!
Very happy with this purchase. These are well made and lovely.
"We are enjoying our new bowls. They are nice looking, the right size and easy to clean."
"I really like these bowls. The design is simple & beautiful, but they are also sturdy & easy to clean."
"I love these bowls. They are really very pretty, well-priced and both dishwasher and oven safe."
Item as described in terms if color and size. It's not too heavy either.
Nice bowls and they are hella cute!
"These are beautiful, well made, and a good weight. Great value."
Colors and raised textured pattern is beautiful.
Wanted to use them for a few weeks before writing a review. Remain very pleased with them. Just ordered more.
Very beautiful set of bowls! They’re very visually pleasing in my cabinet. They are also made well and pretty sturdy!
"I absolutely love these bowls and love the colors! They are just what I wanted. Just the right size for soup, cereal and salads."
Beautiful bowls! I love them!
"dislike nothing - good size for soup, cereal, salad"
The surviving bowls look nice but due to piss poor packaging only 2 out of the 4 survived shipping.
Just what I was looking for
These books are great! They are very pretty with the textured design. They are a great addition to our current dish set. Really good size and clean very well.
"I DARE YOU TO BUY THIS PRODUCT! It says it holds 24 ounces. Yes, you can pour 24 ounces of some liquid to the brim, but you will not be able to move it."
Love these bowls! Beautiful and durable.
"Bowls were just as expected except if microwaved too long, potholders are needed. Well made, easy to clean and they are nice looking to boot. Well priced."
Classic bowls . Nice weight and match other dishes.
Easy to clean and looks beautiful
Bowls are attractive and durable! They are heavily used by two teenage kids and remain in perfect condition.
The bowls are really nice quality. I love the colors. Nice size for anything.
The bowls are absolutely beautiful and the perfect size.
They are perfect for cereal!
"I like these bowls! They are well made and very good in size, perfect for pasta, salad or banana splits! I like light blue."
Not as deep as I had hoped. Still have some microwave boil over.
It’s a gift. Very nice quality!
Great for cereal or soup and very attractive!
"Used to use white melamine bowls. The cinnamon turned my bowls an ugly brown color that I couldn't get out. With these: no staining, easy to wash and don't get too hot to handle straight out of the microwave. Glad I bought them."
"Nice bowls. A little smaller than my old bowl, so maybe I'll lose a pound or two."
Easy to clean and nice for cereal and soups
"I really like these bowls for breakfast cereal or soup. They are a great low cost option and they seem to be totally dishwasher safe after 5 or 6 cycles, no damage to be found!"
"Recently moved my elderly parents in with us and found that we go through a lot more bowls very fast. I wanted to add some bowls that matched my current green/black set without paying the hefty price tag demanded by my previous set manufacturer. These bowls fit the bill nicely. They are a good size and very sturdy. The only problem I’ve had is that they get extremely hot in the microwave! My mom eats instant oatmeal every morning, and we cannot use these bowls because they get much hotter than the other bowls that came with my set of dishes. If you just plan to use them for cold cereal, they are great! Just don’t put them in the microwave."
"Perfect for cereal, rice, soup or dessert"
"Nothing wrong with the construction of these, but they have a bunch marks left from using silverware to eat out of them. That concerns me that whatever glaze was used is very poor quality. They look old and used inside after just a few weeks. I’m considering replacing with a better, well known brand."
"These are tremendous bowls, the quality is top notch. The only fault was one of the bowls did crack during shipping, but I reached out directly to the company and they are sending a replacement. Their email response came within' 5 minutes of me sending out an email to them, explaining the issue and they quickly and diligently worked to resolve the issue.  I highly recommend this bowl set."
It’s exactly what it says it is. They look great and clean great. They do chip fairly easily so as long as you’re careful then you’ll be fine. I’ve already broken one and chipped another but that was my fault and not the bowls.
"We bought a whole set, they are heavy and look modern Nordic. But the glaze gets marks from the silverware that won’t go away."
... and everything else about these bowls is great ... AND they look very chic ...!
These bowls were a perfect size and were used in making quilted bowl cozies for Christmas gifts. I wish they were in more available colors to choose from.
"Perfect for what I needed them for, but a little on the heavy side"
Good quality for its price! It’s dishwasher safe too!
Worth the money
"The size of the bowls are perfect for serving a diversity of foods including soup, rice, vegetables, and much more. They also fit my dishwasher perfectly, it’s definitely a good buy."
Very heavy and very easy to chip
"Good for soup, cereal and snack such as fruit and yogurt. Dishwasher safe and Microwave safe. Also looks very durable. Love them!"
Absolutely love the bowls. They are made of great quality and looks amazing. The size is also good. Will purchase more as time comes.
They are bowls. They arrived unbroken. They are black.
"Crap, plus they will cheat you on your refund"
"A little smaller than expected but still good for soups, cereal, noodles, etc."
I used it for soup and beefsteak and it was easy to hold so I really like it.
There was a bowl that came chipped but overall good experience.
I was too lazy to return these. They seem oddly heavy. The glaze doesn't look like the photos.
They were a little smaller than I thought they'd be. One also came broke but I don't think that's the seller's fault.
Only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they do not stack well because they do not nest
"I like them. Good weight, Good size 220x for my morning oatmeal, banana, blueberry, and flax meal."
"These are good quality and sturdy bowls. They are very slick and circular, so I have to be careful when holding them. Outside of that, good quality and good price."
Nice bowls and hold just the right amount of cereal or ice cream
Perfect size for cereal or salad
Good size bowls
Very durable. Microwave and dishwasher safe. Goes beautifully with my color pattern dinner dishes
"These are the perfect bowls. They have a smooth glazed surface inside and outside of the bowl that makes them easy to clean and protects against stains. They're deep enough for cereal, salad, fruit, rice, and noodles without splashing out. The black color makes them look stylish and modern. These bowls can be coordinated with all of your tableware and makes a beautiful presentation."
Just received my new bowls and they match my plates perfectly. They are the perfect size for cereal - hot or cold.
"One of the four bowls arrived with a glazed over chip on the rim, but it wasn't a dealbreaker, the bowls otherwise are great for cereal!"
Great looking weighty. Bought 2 sets!
I would buy them again absolutely.
Very pretty .I purchased these for use as a desert bowl and they are perfect . They hold 9 ounces of water and still a little room left as a point of size . Perfect foe ice cream and cobbler . Arrived quickly.
Bonita
Great value for the price.
We use these every day!
"They stack nicely and they are microwave safe and dishwasher safe. Cute patterns and they are a nice size for soups, salads, and cereals ..."
Loved the colorful patterns.
"I would give five stars but on the outside bottom ring, inner portion, there was a sharp burr on two bowls probably as a result of the manufacturing process. One was sharp enough to cut. Not a problem for me as I ground it down with a Dremel tool to smooth it out. Also, I received two red bowls and no yellow one. Oh well. Otherwise great bowls, nice to look at. Packed well, no breaks or chips."
"Solid, durable and beautiful. Added some brightness to my dad’s life in his last few months."
I LOVE these bowls. The porcelain is very strong and break resistant. They wash up in the dishwasher very nicely and they are just gorgeous. I love eating out of them.
Perfect size for snacking. Great for portion control especially people on diets on watching how much they eat. Microwaveable too and colors are pretty
Super cute well made Definitely no complaints will be looking for more items from them thanks
These bowls work like good bowls should. They hold food and you eat out of them. What more could you ask for?
"I was always running out of enough small bowls to serve with. I saw these, loved all the pretty designs and colors. I’m very happy with them; they are fun to look at and use!"
Love my new colorful and so useful bowls for all meals. They brighten any table.
"Love these bowls. perfect size, beautiful colors, dish washer safe"
Love these bowls. Very pretty patterns. Happy with purchase. Smaller than expected.
Haven't had a chance to use them but they seem like we'll be happy with them.
"They’re sturdy, can go in the dishwasher/microwave, great size options, love them!"
These bowls are lovely! Exactly what I was looking for!
Value for the money.
Beautiful
Love it!
Was a Christmas gift for my mom - she loved them .. raved about how beautiful they are and says there size is great
Beautiful bowls. Great size. Love them
Perfect for everything!!
Love everything about these BEAUTIFUL bowls.
Beautiful and is holding up well!
Super and very pretty bowls. I bought for large chili party and they were prefect!
arrived in perfect shape. They are very pretty and well made. Love them!
Exactly what I was looking for.
Easy to clean and perfect size for soup or cereal!
"Great size, color, and price! What’s not to like?!?"
Love them. Just the right size for small servings. Live the different colors and patterns
right size for me and beautiful design/colors.
As described and more
Colors are vibrant. Perfect size. Packed very well. Love these!
Love them
I'd buy them again if I needed some....
"You buy bowls like these if you really like color and patterns and want your dishware to pop! The 6 inch bowls are perfect for cereal or salad or even soup. They stack nicely, look great, clean easily, and are a compliment to any table. I particularly like the crisp edges on the patterns (the images are not fuzzy and do not bleed into the white) and the fact the the colors are vivid."
"These Lareina porcelain bowls are very beautiful. I love all the different details on the inside and outside of the bowls. They came neatly and safely packaged and in perfect condition. They all stack nicely on top of each other. Great size for everything from soups to desserts. Each bowl weighs about 16 oz and can hold 16 oz of liquids comfortably. While I can probably fill these bowls with 23 oz of liquids like the listing stated, it will 100% overflow if moved at all. This set also comes with 6 very high quality, heavyweight stainless steel spoons. They make excellent dessert and coffee spoons. Easy to wash with a little bit of soap and water. Microwave and dishwasher safe."
"My family has been using them for weeks and we really like them. All the designs are perfect and they go through the dishwasher on top rack without problems. Super durable too, far more than I expected. Size is just right. The only thing I don't like is the pedestal base on each one because it makes them slightly wobbly in my cabinet when stacked on the plates. Other than that they're perfect."
"I loved these bowls! They look so great. The quality seems nice! I found the perfect size for cereal, soup, and for serving snacks. These are microwavable and dishwasher safe! If someone wants, then they can be a perfect gift too! I will highly recommend these and buy them again!  The only concern I have is about the way these are packed. I am surprised that only one was broken out of six !!  Othet than that they are 6 star items."
Fun and beautiful! Great quality!
I have always had basic white bowls and am so glad I ordered these on a whim. They’re just pretty and vibrant colors. They’ve been in and out of the dishwasher and I haven’t had any issues. I would definitely purchase again. I also ordered the mugs and plates which are great too.
"I am totally in love with these bowls. The patterns are beautiful and unique, and the quality of the ceramics is excellent. Highly recommend!"
Perfecto
I bought these to use as gifts but might just keep them for myself. They are the perfect little bowl and the colors are wonderful.
"They are just the right size for soup, rice bowls or cereal, and they brighten up my open shelves."
Awesome just as pictured! Even larger than expected great quality
"Well made, gorgeous colors easy to clean"
Love the designs on the bowls. Perfect size
Perfect size and I love the mismatched set. They are sturdy and so pretty !
Muy bonitos
These bowls are just the right size for cereal or ice cream. And they're so pretty!
"My only bowls were from an old set of China - Very nice but brittle after decades. When I sliced my hand on a chipped edge while doing dishes, I decided it was way time to invest in some nice bowls. These are perfect! I love the size of them - they easily handle a nice bowl of yogurt, fruit, and granola. And they’re so pretty with all the colors and designs that are different, yet compliment each other, they just make me happy!"
"These are amazing quality at a great price! I love that ice cream, cereal etc. Fit perfectly"
"Great value for the money. Also, and be aware that, dowan plates have a certain 'handmade' look, meaning that even tho they look perfectly symmetric, when stacked together or comparing them you'll notice that some edges go slightly up or down. We happen to like them like that. They are easy to hold, perfect size, easy to clean and you can build your own set. I would only incorporate more options on the buying options, so that you could buy a single piece as well as a set of 2, 4 or 6."
"Perfect size and shape! Plus, microwave-safe, dishwasher-safe, can even go in freezer or oven! Couldn’t be any better!  Additional review: While I still like the product, I downgraded my review by 1 star because of their response when I wrote them to inform them of a possible manufacturing glitch. I liked my initial set of 4 bowls so much that I clicked Amazon’s “Order again” button. When I got the second set, I noticed that they didn’t stack the same as my first set. When I measured them, it turned out that one set was 1/8” taller and 3/8” wider than the other set. Otherwise, the bowls in each set were nearly identical in size and dimensions. I ordered another set, and it was identical to the smaller set, so I returned the larger set. I wrote Dowan’s Customer Service Dept so they might be aware of a possible manufacturing glitch they needed to take care of. Instead, they wrote back that it was due to differences in the manufacturing process. While I already took that possibility into account, I don’t buy that as the cause of the discrepancy, since each of the bowls in each set were nearly identical to each other, and the discrepant set was completely different in size. If you plan on getting any of their products, I would suggest that you purchase a full set of whatever you want, as your set might not match if you were to try adding on later, and their Customer Service Dept is not likely to be very helpful."
"The Dowan bowls looked (in the photos) and the description made the bowl set look like a quality product for a great deal. Looking at the reviews really sold me on making the decision to purchase the bowl set. When received today, 7/22/20, the bowls lived up to the description and seem like a high quality product and very happy with my purchase so far. I am excited to be using them for some time to come. I will definitely highly consider Dowan products for any future pictures."
"I love these Porcelain bowls! They are the perfect size, 22 ounces. Perfect for soups, salads and cereals. I love the pure white color, it makes them elegant."
"We use these bowls as any family would...meaning we don't go throwing them around or trying to juggle them. At first, I was pleased with the appearance but in the first week, a bowl chipped. Whatever, it was 2020 and I had more pressing issues so I tossed it and moved on. I started noticing more bowls were chipping over the next few weeks. I put on my mental to-do list to look into this more thoroughly but again, it's 2020...bowls aren't exactly a priority. Today though was the last straw. My son handed me a piece of the bowl that he PULLED OUT OF HIS MOUTH because it was in his food! Unacceptable and dangerous!!! I have had non chip resistant bowls that lasted years....I don't get how these can be marketed as chip resistant. I only wanted to share my story because this could be really dangerous for others. So now, it's 2021, there are still some really pressing issues and now I need to find some actual chip resistant bowls. Any suggestions?"
"Made out of strong, yet surprisingly delicate ceramic material, these soup bowls are built to last. Made with a bright white, glazed surface that reflects the light beautifully and makes it easy to clean.  A perfect addition to any kitchen, this set of four stackable, chip-resistant ceramic soup bowls is microwave and dishwasher safe. Great for use when preparing and serving my favorite soups, they also make a very stylish serving bowl for pasta dishes.  The contemporary all-white style will add a sleek and modern look to your table. Sturdy and durable, this set is excellent for everyday use and ideal for hosting dinner parties.  Typically I buy these bowls from Asian markets in the city, but it's a hassle to drive that long. So I was grateful when I found similar soup bowls on Amazon. I've been using them for over a year now and haven't got any chips yet. Good buy."
No problems with these bowls thus far. They hold up in the microwave and in the dishwasher. The only issue that it was in the sink for about 12 hours with the grill (which I guess is some kind of metal) from my roaster and stained the outside of the bowl a bit. I like to believe it was my boyfriend’s fault and nothing to do with the quality of the bowls.
"These deep bowls are perfect for soup, and they hold a nice amount. Also good for salad."
Great bowels and the right size for my mini wheats!
Great bowls. Came packed very well. They match existing dinnerware and are the perfect size
"I have been using my children's melamine bowls for things like salad and eggs and grits during the quarantine, since I'm working from home. Ordered these, hoping for 1. Slightly larger; and 2. Something a grownup could eat out of without having a cartoon monkey on them. Also wanted a different material, as melamine gets very hot in the microwave and it's, you know, plastic.  Ordered these with limited expectations, as the price is low, and I am pleasantly surprised. They are a beautiful, rounded shape, simple and a perfect size for a bowl of ramen, a lunch-portioned salad, or a VERY generously portioned bowl of pasta. I use them for quick grits in the microwave, and while the bowl definitely gets hot and holds heat for a reasonable amount of time (which is actually really nice when you're eating in a drafty, chilly basement office) I'm not concerned with what chemicals it is leaching into my food.  They came well-packaged in a box marked fragile, unable to shift at all, so no concerns with breakage.  They are deceptively sturdy considering their somewhat delicate appearance. I ordered a set of 4 and I'm thinking I will order another set of 4 so that the family can use them. I'm very pleased."
"I don’t think I’ve ever written a review on Amazon before but I actually love these bowls! They’re elegant, easy to hold, not heavy, and just the right size.  Before purchasing them, I was thinking that they might be a bit too big (since they seem to be the largest size Dowan bowls that aren’t serving bowls) but they’ve turned out to be the perfect size for what I wanted. Picture a medium-sized (not large-sized) phở bowl and that will give you some idea. You can put a “regular”-sized portion of food in one—it probably won’t even be halfway full—or a can of soup or beans or some salad and still have plenty of room to add some sauce, dressing or condiments and stir things up. So they’re deep without being unwieldy.  They look great with elegant lines and thin ceramic sides. They’re bright white (sort of eggshell, not pure white), shiny and very easy to clean. They stack pretty well but not perfectly—the bowls might rotate little off-kilter within another—but they never get stuck together, which a few other reviews mentioned.  As for packing, each bowl came encased in a Styrofoam-like mesh so they were in perfect condition on arrival.  I’m actually way more pleased with this purchase than I expected.  [Addition] At least one other review says these bowls are not microwave-safe. I’ve been microwaving frozen vegetables in them on HIGH for about five minutes in my 1100-watt microwave nearly nightly for the past three months. The bowls do get a little hot to the touch but I haven’t had any problem microwaving food in them."
Love this set and for the price?! Can’t beat it! Thanks
"With the kids getting older I wanted to replace the old plastic bowls with something a little more adult.  The bowls were packed well. The external boxes were a little crushed, but the bowls were undamaged.  Since I liked the size, look, and feel I ordered a second set for a total of 16 bowls. They are heavy enough that when you pour soup into them they don't move.  The glaze on the bowls makes they all very easy to clean, from pasta to cereal and even when you leave them overnight in the sink, you know you do it from time to time, they still are very easy to clean. A little Dawn and warm water and it is clean and the first time you used them.  Thus far there are no scratches or dings, however my 14 year old son dropped it 2 feet from the shelf to the counter and it shattered, but to me that was expected since it is a porcelain bowl.  Cons: When we clean them with soap they can get slick and it is easy to drop it into the sink, so far nothing has broken due to this, but this could be an issue if you are putting this into a dish washer.  HOT!!! Wow, make sure you keep in mind that this is porcelain and in the microwave it gets very hot. From time to time, I don't think about it and burn my hand reaching in to take the bowl out. This is the only thing that stopped me from giving these bowls 5 stars across the board."
"I am not sure why some of the previous reviews for these dishes were bad. The set of 4 large 7” diameter dishes I ordered are perfect in shape, capacity & quality. I especially like the fact that they were nicely boxed and well packed in a sturdy box to prevent breakage in delivery. I have used them in the microwave, washed them several times and never any problems. Those people whining about not being able to stack these dishes are being petty. I’ve owned numerous porcelain bowls and they don’t stack perfectly. No big deal. What do you want for $20–$5 a bowl? I don’t leave many Amazon product reviews but I highly recommend that you purchase these."
"I searched and searched online for some bowls that I thought would be durable and would not chip, I finally took a chance on this brand and ordered these. I am very happy I did. These bowls were needed to replace some cereal bowls ( different Brand) that I have that are chipping all over the edges. This is my first order from Dowan and I was not sure what I would get . I was very happy when I received them. The order arrived on time and they were packaged very well. The Bowls are very pretty, everything was perfect. The bowls seem like they will be durable, they do not seem like they will chip easily and they are just the right size for soup or cereal. I am very pleased with the product. Will be ordering additional products from this company."
"These are a nice large bowl for cereal or soup or whatever. The description when I purchased said they were both microwave and dishwasher safe. While they are dishwasher safe, they are NOT microwave safe. That's fine for me as I rarely reheat something meant for a bowl in the microwave. However, if you're looking for a bowl that won't get dangerously hot - this is NOT the one for you.  However, if you're looking for a bowl that's easy to hold, holds a decent amount of food, and looks attractive, I highly suggest these. I'm considering getting 4 more."
"Beautiful bowls, have had them for two months now. Very durable and have had no issues with chipping or cracking. Great size, modern look."
"I love these white bowls. I have all white dinner plates and serving pieces (and the bowls that come in my pattern are too shallow). These bowls are the perfect addition and perfect size. The packaging was also amazing. The bowls do not touch each other in the packaging, so the chances of them breaking during shipping is not likely. These are nice enough to give as a gift."
I bought these bowls for morning breakfast cereals and to feed my little one. These bowls are deep and very lightweight so easy to handle for adults or child. Easy to wash by hand or dishwasher due to nonstick material. These are microwave and freezer safe so can be used to store leftover dinner and next day food can be re-heated in same bowl. It doesn't take much space in kitchen cabinet because can be stacked up. Bowls are made of top grade porcelain so healthy to use.  Bowl Quality is great but price could be little better.
"I got these bowls because I really wanted something that was a bit larger than the 2-cup size bowls we had. I was actually looking for ones that held 3 cups, but I bought these that hold 4 cups, and have been thrilled with them. They are perfect for serving vegetables, and my husband loves to use them for his big bowls of cereal. I also like them as my can of soup fits in them without spilling. We also order take-home Pho, and these are the perfect size for those as well. Strong, durable, and pretty in white!"
"We bought Mikasa coma from Costco several years ago and love the simplicity of the dinnerware. The bowls however have been vanishing one by one so when I looked for replacements I was shocked to see the price of the authentic Mikasa bowls!  These were recommended and much less expensive and what do you know, a virtually exact replica of our current bowls but for half of the price (or less)!  I definitely recommend; they are great sized bowls for soup, salad, cereal or everyday.  They stack well (aren't too snug as to get stuck in one another) and come very well protected in the box."
"Got these 4 of these bowls as a gift and absolutely love them! They are like fine China - thin lipped and not heavy. I've used these for everything - soup, cereal, snacks.... I put them in the dishwasher and they are fine. I recently bought 4 more because i did notice a few small chip marks on one of the bowls and wanted to make sure I have enough that at least serves 4."
I bought these for soup but I like a soup bowl to be a bit deeper and not so wide but they do work well. We use them for everything from cereal to ice cream even soup. Great ones to just have in your kitchen. I ended up buying the perfect soup bowls from the some company and they are also great so I would recommend this brand.
"Once they arrived I was very happy with the look but worried their ""thinness"" would be an issue but they are not too thin. They are very large by household standards. These are the size of bowl I would expect from an American style restaurant---large. Which is what I like because I have a lot of extra room in the bowl so I don't spill as often. It's the same reason when I go to Starbucks and ask for a ""tall"" coffee in a ""vente"" cup. I need the room."
Cereal bowl perfection!!! These are also good side salad bowls. They are deep and they are approximately 7 inches across and 3 inches deep. I ended up buying 2 sets!
"These bowls are perfect for what I was looking for. Bought another brand, but would ""burn"" myself when taking out of the microwave. These bowls I have not experienced that issue. Cleaning them was easy and I like the diversity of usage, microwave, dishwasher, oven, freezer, etc. These bowls are not as thick as my last other brand bowls, so are much lighter in use. There have been no metal scrape marks on the bowl after using utensils when either eating, or mixing items, such as beating eggs."
"These bowls are the perfect size for easymac, cereal, and soup. I don't like having bowls filled completely to the top. Easymac was getting spilled over in the microwave. My husband needed bigger bowl for his morning cereal. Soup season is coming and I wanted bigger bowls for that too. These bowls solved all of these problems. I like plain white dishes. I also like that this isn't stoneware. I like the weight, size, and color."
"I just hot mine, so I may update later. Here are my first impressions: 1) Arrived in very well padded wrapping, so no accidental cracks, scratches or breaks. 2) Nice thick walls on the bowls & bottoms. So far, the outside of the bowl does get burning hot, so not scorching my fingers is nice. 3) Fits in my hand easily. I'm on 5""4 so that was a nice bonus. 4) The glazing & coloring is nice and even."
Great bowl... used it for a year plus now and it is a great piece to eat out of. Have washed it multiple times in the dishwasher without it getting chipped or anything.
"Was looking all over to add to my 30 year old Mikasa ones that were just the right size. Serves one for a large salad, stew or soup. Can be used as a small serving for a group. Wash great in the dishwasher. Love the white - goes with all my dish sets. Ordering for my son for his Birthday. Buy these!"
Bowls were great. Have had a hard time finding bowls that I like that do not break in microwave. I microwaved all of them. Thankfully the manufacturer packaged them well because Amazon employees do not understand the importance of arrows or packing. Box was too big and bowls were on side. I was sure they were broken. Thankfully all in one piece!  Update - Still loving these bowls they are the first really nice dishware I have purchased. Really worth the buy!
"Very impressed with the beauty, style, and porcelain quality. The fact that the promotional offers were not applicable with no way to know that until checkout distressed me since I bought a set of the soup spoons(which I LOVE)to qualify for the 50% off promotion. I need to budget and it was my first time buying DOWAN. I will look out for their offers and buy more. Sheila M."
"I really like these bowls. They are exactly what I was looking for: they are very lightweight and thin, yet also sturdy and appear to be quite durable. They are shorter and wider than other bowls I own, which is more convenient for the foods I use them for. It makes them easier to eat out of, and they are especially great for soups and oatmeal. They are very smooth and easy to clean as well."
"Great size bowls. Love them, but the rim chips easy. 3 of the 4 bowls have several chips. They haven't cracked or completely broke yet. The rim is definitely the weak point. Disappointed they are not stronger. I do like their products. I have the small plates and 2 sets of ramekin."
"Our family needed to replace some cereal bowls and BOY DID THEY HAVE OPINIONS ABT IT. So, mom went on the search. And I landed (duh) on amazon. These bowls are perfect. My toddlers AND teenager are happy with the size, and I'm happy that I can put them in the dishwasher and use them again and again! SO happy with them that we have since purchased 2 others sizes for dipping sauces etc..."
"Looks elegant, Will use them for dinner tonight"
"Stackable great for soup to cereal, easy to clean."
I love these little bowls! They are very versatile. I use them to scramble eggs in to ice cream bowl(self control size)...use for my grandkids also. They match other Dowan dishes and containers. I love the butter fish. I originally purchased to use for serving soup at the holidays. I purchased 12 & love them.
"I really wanted porcelain bowls that are footed so when eating hot foods the bowl is easier to handle. These are bigger than I expected which is okay, but I thought they would be smaller. They are seven inches across the top from rim to rim and they are three inches deep."
"Christmas gift for my wife and she loves them. I gave her 8 of them. I definitely gained a few brownie points by giving her these. We have already used them on Christmas Day. We had chicken, sausage, and shrimp gumbo and these bowls were perfect. By the way, they came extremely well packaged. Highly recommend these bowls!"
Beautiful pure white bowls. Each packed in their own rubber sacks. Really well done. I was impressed so I ordered some more.
"They match my other Dowan bowls I've had for years, which are still in excellent - no scratches/chips - condition. Have used them in the microwave and dishwasher, for hot and cold. I just love them."
"These are some great little bowls. I’ve had them about 6 weeks and use them weekly. I’ve used them for soup, chili, salads, oatmeal, you name it. They are easy to clean and have not scratched or stained, even with red sauce. They hold the perfect amount of food. They also pair very well with my minimalist white dishware that I purchased at a much higher price point from a fancy store."
"my old bowls were thick like potter and these are nice and thin like good china. I won't know durability for a while, but they arrived unchipped and in good packaging. They have been through the dishwasher one time with no problems."
"The first thing I was impressed by was the packaging...I don’t see any way these could get damaged in shipping. I had two similar white bowls and was planning to go to the store I got them from and try to get more. Then I saw these on Amazon and they look exactly the same, at a better price. So glad I got them, they fit right in!"
"MY GO TO PRODUCT in my kitchen. I have all the bowls and I would not dream of buying anything else. Seriously excellent in all ways. I have the super large spaghetti bowls, the next size down for salads, and the 22 oz cereal bowls! Awesome stuff. Barbara"
Love these bowls so so much. They have become my fav!! And honestly the boxing and packaging was so pretty. I can’t believe they don’t sell this brand at Macy’s or other stores. This looks like a very professional brand and made well. I can’t wait to buy the plates and more bowls! Love the white color too.
I love these bowls. Hold a good amount and are attractive. The only problem I have with them is that they don't stack straight but I'll live with that cause I do like the bowls.
"Great looking product and packaging. We enjoyed learning about your life's philosophy. A 4.5"" diameter bowl would have been preferred to better fit in our cabinets. I thought I saw this available then it was gone. We had to do a bit of rearranging but finally were able to get them to fit. - Thanks."
They are light weight and durable—perfect size for cereal or soup.
Very nice . Shape is bit different which was why I liked it. Most bowels slope from top to bottom smoothly. These have a small section after this cupping where the side drops to bottom. This is visible. The design is more attractive than others we have or have seen .
"I bought these bowls to replace some plastic bowls that I purchased for my kids when they were younger because they broke other bowls, Now that they are older, I was ready to purchase a quality bow, that I could be proud to pull out of my cabinets. The quality of the bowls is very high and they look great. They hold a good amount of cereal, ice cream, and other items. I would definitely recommend these bowls to others. I plan on purchasing more Dowan products for my kitchen to replace items that I can trust my kids with now that they are older."
Better than I expected. Very happy with my order.
"I've only had these bowls about a month, but they are very nice. Lightweight and fairly white in color. I needed more bowls from Amazon Basics, but they don't sell them directly. Only as part of a set. So far, these have held up very well, unlike stuff from Target."
I liked these bowls so much that I ordered a second set. I especially like that they can be used in the microwave. They don't get as hot as my old set. Thanks.
"I just received 29 oz bowls, 4 Pack, 7 Inches, White through Amazon Prime. They're a perfect size for hot/cold cereal, soups, smaller salads and meals because they have a wide opening. Bright white will look great contrasted with food, they feel sturdy and comfortable to touch and can be used for serving, storage, and eating."
"We used it for soup! We’ve never had real soup and cereal bowls. Ours you’re lucky to get the soup bone to the table so we love the shiny sleek finish and they hold plenty of soup, chili, and cereal plus they can be used for fruit bowls. So pleased."
"I bought these bowls for my Dad to use to cook his 1 min oatmeal. He loves them. He reports that they cook oatmeal perfectly and never overflow. They cook evenly so there are no hard oatmeal kernels. He is so happy as he used to cook oatmeal in a pan on the stove, soak the pan afterward, and still have to scrape off oatmeal from the bottom of the pan. He has saved himself 15- 20 min in cook time and cleaning. He loves these bowls. He also heats up soup in them and they are perfect for this as well."
A little worried the edges are going to chip or crack at one point but they've been holding up very well.
"We needed to match some other dinnerware that we purchased on Amazon, and it is perfect. These look good, and they seem very sturdy."
There wasn't anything I didn't like about these bowls. They are so very nice and well made. Like them very well!!
Very good looking .. slightly larger than I thought they’d be .. but that’s ok.
"The bowls are lovely, they came quickly & packed well so nothing was broken. They are exactly the size I needed (32 oz., though it may have said 39 oz. on the page). They are rather thin, but haven't broken yet. They description says they are made to resist breaking. So far I have to agree. 4 starts on sturdiness because the rim is pretty thin. I saw that someone had written that they didn't fit well together, but that wasn't my experience."
Good bowls. Use them for boys cereal. Not too big and not too small. Wash easily in dishwasher. Boys dropped one and it held up so not disappointed.
"After about a month every one of these bowls had several chips broken out of the top edge It’s very thin and beaks easily. We are not particularly rough on these, I think that the chipping happens in the dish washer. I have another bowl set from Target that has lasted for years and I’m likely going to buy some more of those."
"I cook a lot of wok food and these bowls are perfect single portions. Easy to clean. Thick enough Im not worried about ever chipping. They are just basic, easy, and just fit for my life."
These are much nicer than I expected! I have all white dishes but they are now discontinued from Pottery Barn and was not able to get new bowls from my pattern any longer. Thought I would give these a try. I wanted to see if they cracked when put in microwave like my Pfaltzgraff bowls did. They did not crack!! I love these bowls and the price was right too!
"We like this bowl because of its size. We have ones from Pier 1 and they’re taller making them hard to hold it in your hands to eat.  These are a good size and lighter. Great for cereal, soup, salad. Glad we ordered it."
These beautiful bowls make a perfect bowl for soups and salads. Durable and pure white glossy finish blends nicely with any decor.
"I'm a devoted Corelle user and have tried all kinds even non-Corelle vitrielle/vitreous glass plates and bowls. None are quite as durable as the classic white. The non-Corelle are the worst of course. But I also found the Corelle's various fashion prints, embossed, square and other new shapes to be less durable... less resistant to chips and breakage. The classic white in the traditional shapes last the longest. They go with everything. Of course I will still buy fun prints and new shapes to add to my collection. But the core of my collection and dishes I use everyday is the classic white Corelle. Which is why I purchased two more sets of these white bowls. I already have a large stack but with everyone quarantined at home eating three meals a day, even my rather large collection is not enough to keep up and keep me from washing dishes 24-7. But I'm happy to have a good reason to buy more Corelle, because they last so long I hardly buy any except to replace broken ones. And on this topic, while they are resistant to breaking and can withstand some drops, every once in a while when they land on the floor just right they will break. When that happens, they don't just break in half, they shatter into a hundred small shards, so do take special care to sweep, vacuum, and discard. I wished they broke like safety glass, into cubes, but they don't.  They stack well and save so much space in my cabinets. In the same space where I can stack 6-8 regular bowls, I can stack 20 of these. Also these classic shape cereal bowls stack better than the new shape cereal bowls. Both Corelle but you can see in my attached picture what a huge difference a tweak in shape made to stack-ability. The classic shape nests so much better and is more space saving. This also applies to how they fit in dishwasher racks...  They wash up well in the dishwasher and always come out dry, shiny, and clean. No nooks and crannies to trap water. They are so easy to store and clean and I can have so many that I never need paper/disposable when having a gathering.  I love these dishes and highly recommend them to anyone interested in light, space saving, well-stacking, easy to clean, long lasting, chip resistant dishes. Just remember, they are thin, light, and glass. They will feel like thin, light glass so don't compare them to or expect them to feel like ceramic or porcelain.  Note: Corelle logo on the backside of the dishes has evolved and changed through the years. I attached a picture of all the various Corelle logos. Some of my dishes are 20+ years old! I know I have authentic Corelle because I buy through reputable retailers or directly from Corelle."
"45 years ago, I received a Corelle dinner set for 8 people as a wedding gift. I still have most of the wedding set . They last a long, long time. I've dropped several of them over the years on ceramic kitchen tile and wood floors. I expected them to shatter into a million pieces. They didn't. I've frozen them. Baked them and microwaved them. The only thing I don't do is heat them over my stove's burner. They have remained intact. I'm currently replacing bowls because my ex-took them when he left. I highly recommend them and the brand."
"what's to say, I think everyone know what corelle is. My husband and I received Corelle when we got married 42 years ago and we are still using it. It survives most everything, except being dropped on a ceramic floor. At one point, I bought a set of ""real dishes"". it wasn't long before I realized how great Corelle is. it doesn't take up much room, doesn't kill your hands to carry, microwaves well, cleans easy. it is the dish of choice! Got rid of those ""real dishes"" and now only have Corelle again. I gave away some of my Corelle bowls to a friend who needed everything and between that and the tile floor taking out a few bowls I needed to replace some bowls. Highly recommend"
"Decent bowls for the price, but I question their authenticity. There’s a big difference in Amazon purchased bowl’s logo compared to bowls I’ve purchased at retail stores (but those bowls are over 8 years old). These Amazon Corelle bowls in general look and feel like standard Corelle bowls but they all have a weird ridge at the bottom. You can feel the ridge “catch” when you pull a bowl off a stack of other bowls. Not sure how that’s gonna affect wear and tear over time. Maybe this was an imperfect batch that they put up for sale? 4 stars because if the ridge and questionable authenticity."
"These are totally fake ... there's no way they're real Corelle because they shatter into a million pieces when dropped from even a short 2ft distance from the dishwasher! This has happened twice now and I'm really disappointed. These bowls are not cheap, and I buy them because they're supposed to be shatter-proof. These actually break WORSE than glass with tiny shards shooting 10ft across the room (no joke) and bits of powdery shattered material everywhere."
"I have used Corelle for many years. I like it because it is lightweight, stacks well, isn't plastic, and is hard to break. Granted, when it does break, it shatters far and wide, but that has hardly ever happened in our kitchen, despite handling by our 5 children and 11 grandchildren.  Some time ago, I gave some of our white cereal bowls to one of our adult children. Afterward, I realized how much we used them. So I was delighted to find this set at such a reasonable price. Once again, we have enough for cereal, for scrambling a couple of eggs or for leftovers in the fridge, covered by a Corelle bread plate"
"This is a review of Corelle Winter Frost 6- Pack Bowl.  I am a big fan of Corelle dishes, and these bowls are just as good as any other Corelle I've purchased. They are light weight, easily cleaned, and have a nice appearance. They also are easy to load in a dishwasher and stack nicely in a cabinet, especially if you are limited on space and do not want a really thick bowl. They also last a very long time.  We purchased these bowls as we seem to need a lot more bowls than plates. These are a very generic looking bowl and match either of the two corelle sets we use. For the most part, these are prep bowls for cooking (putting sliced onions in before cooking, etc.), but we also use them for dinner and snacks for the kids. Size wise, they are large enough for a side salad, a moderately large bowl of soup, or a bowl of cereal. They are the standard Corelle bowl size if you are familiar with the brand.  I recommend the purchase and will be buying more corelle bowls in the future. They might be a different design, but they will be corelle."
"I was surprised when my new Corelle dinnerware arrived. They are thin and light weight to the point of reminding me of toy plates. Not that I think that is a big deal. With my bad back and rapidly advancing years I see that as a positive attribute. Another reviewer noted that they will shatter when dropped on a tile floor and I'm sure that is true but while drying a bowl for the first time it slipped out of my fingers and landed hard on my tile floor. It didn't shatter but rather bounced three times before coming to rest with no scratches, chips or cracks of any kind. I couldn't believe my eyes and immediately myself ordered a second set. In addition to their toughness, they also come out of a microwave without being heated themselves. I don't know how many times I've burned my fingers heating food on my old so called microwave safe plates which frequently are heated hotter than the food! Elligant, tough, made in USA, what more can a person want?"
"**Read this if you are planning to buy them**  I don't know who packed these, but these I want to let any future buyer know about what I found before buying them. These come in an actual Corelle box. Pretty standard, like something you might find at a store where they're just stacked one on top of another without padding in between since it's not meant to be banged around. Well, take that and stick it in a single bubble wrap envelope. That envelope is the only thing protecting them.  I'm soooooooo surprised that none of them were broken or at least chipped! Maybe that's just how strong Corelle is. Or maybe I got lucky that this was surprisingly handled with care.  Regardless, I know Corelle is a good product and everything looks fine. I just wanted to let anyone thinking about these to be aware that it might be possible to have one broken in transport to you."
"We already have Corelle plates, small bowls, small plates (not a set, just from various sources) and have loved them for their stackability, light weight, and cleaning ease. When I broke one of our few remaining ceramic bowls, I decided to see what I could find in Corelle bowls. So glad I decided on these plain white cereal/soup bowls. Ordered 2 packs of 6 and they were delivered the same day, and the delivery guy was so careful when he put them down. I was a bit worried about breakage due to some reviews, but none of the 12 bowls were broken or even chipped. The price was excellent. We're so very pleased with these bowls!!!"
"We bought one of the 4-place sets of dishes that include plates and bowls, and wanted an extra set of bowls. These are shaped differently than the ones that came with the 4-place setting, and that's a good thing. The sides on these are sloped just enough to let them stack nicely in the cupboard, but it also lets me fit 3 of these in the dishwasher in the space that only 2 of the ones that have more vertical sides take up.  While this style and the other shape that came with the 4-place setting (the more vertically-sided bowls) both hold food just fine, being able to fit more of these in the dishwasher is a huge benefit of this bowl's shape versus the other style. We end up using these first."
"Bowls are a nice size for your morning oatmeal, cereal, or fruit. They are good sized for small bowls of soup and perfectly sized to use for a side salad or bowl of Icecream. The bright white complements any other color you may use on your table. They maintain their shine even after many years of being washed in a dishwasher. These stack nicely in my cabinets too. I have given sets as gifts and friends and family have loved them."
"These were purchased to add to an existing set of Corelle dishes purchased in 1973. To date all pieces are still in tact. While I can't speak to how long these will last since Corelle has tweaked the manufacturing process since our purchase of the original set, I can say that the original set has been great. It has lasted through multiple moves (military life), with portions of it traveling to other states to see two children through college one of whom even took it through two more years of active duty in an apartment with three other soldiers."
"Great simple bowl with NO LEAD in it, unlike a lot of other dishware. Would recommend but know that the bowl is a little small. P.S. The plates are great too!"
"There isn't any comparison between these bowls and any other. They are the best. A bit expensive but they will last the rest of your life.  They are unbreakable. Super light. They don't get hot in the microwave (well sort of if the thing inside get's super hot like oatmeal). Semi-oven-proof. Slick and easy to clean. Thin and stackable (you can fit about a million in a cupboard ). Between these bowls and the plates, I use about 1/2 the space and have extra room for cups and mugs. I would buy these in every color of the rainbow if I could (unfortunately Corelle's pattern selections are the most dull)."
"Received these today. They're nice bowls and they're Correlle alright, just a whole lot smaller than I expected. I have old bowls that hold about 20 oz, thought these would be good replacements. Nope. Poured two cups of water, 16 oz., into one of them and it almost ran over. I'm guessing that they are 18 oz. bowls to the very rim, but are better suited for holding 15. I was happy to find a set of 6 for less than $18, now I know why. Don't want to, but will be sending them back."
"We never did have enough of these bowls. When I saw these on Amazon it was a no brainer to buy. Excellent price versus local. I have and still use Correlle plates I purchased 50 years ago. White Correlle can make a beautiful table if you use nice napkins, tableware and accessories. The dinner plates are very flat so your food does not all run to the center of the plate like stoneware or cheap china."
"Ok perhaps I am biased but I love Corelle. However I have kids so glass kitchenware is a scary experience. For me however Corelle combines the best of both worlds. I can have Corelle and STILL feel safe with my kids using them, washing them. Reality is my kids drop them on a regular basis (normally trying to get out of washing them!)  I also have a small amount of cabinet space the and fact they are so light and take up so little room is amazing. I can fit all my plates, cups, services dishes in a fraction of the place that normal dishes will go.  So my kids other favorite habit is loading the dishwasher without rinsing the dishes completely. An annoying difficult habit to break. But with my Corelle I have no worries. Simplistic to clean is an understatement. Virtually nothing stains them and the worst stuck on food comes off in the dishwasher.  Really I feel proud to have people over for dishes despite having 5 kids and when guests are come over they tell me how brave I am to have such paper thin light plates with my kids. I can safely just smile and explain how my Corelle works!"
"I love Corelle and purchased TWO sets (each set is 6 bowls) of these because of their PERFECT SIZE and the number of uses they have -- cereal, ice cream, side salads (of all types), prep bowls, etc! They're microwave and dishwasher safe and will last for YEARS (Literally ALL dishware gets brittle after years of microwaving and dishwasher use). HIGHLY RECOMMEND - YOU WON'T REGRET GETTING TWO SETS OF THESE!"
"Got these to put in an emergency overnight bag since the wife has weird dietary requirements and we must have supplies on hand in case we get stuck anywhere. Needed some bowls that were durable, light weight and were not from my cupboard at home (can't break up a set).  We have switch to Corelle from home use cause they are durable, easy to clean, easy to replace if you do break one, and do not cost an arm and a leg to replace. So for the emergency bag there was not really any other choice then to replicate what we had at home."
"These bowls are a great addition to my Corelle dishes. I've been adding to my set when I see them available. We are going through more bowls with Grandkids coming to visit. I love the plain white because they are simple, stack easily and hold up over the years."
"I was concerned when I bought these bowls because an earlier review said they were small. That’s not 5he case, the bowls are same as ones that I purchased years ago as a setting for four or six people. They are perfect and match. I would definitely buy again. They are good for kids because they are very durable."
"They are light weight, yet sturdy, I drop them and it is very rare that they ever break. My dad, who used to research everything he purchased, loved Corelle and now I understand why. They look nice, they're bright white, or come in various patterns, inexpensive, don't weigh down your cabinet shelves, they are thin so they don't take up a lot of space. Perfect for every day."
"The one con to these bowls is how plain they are, but for some people that's a plus. I didn't want elaborate designs, just something smallish and functional that would stack easily with a different set of Corelle bowls that had come as part of a larger dish set. These bowls are lightweight and not too large, which is what I prefer. I have some musculoskeletal issues which make handling larger and heavier dishes tricky.  These have gotten a thorough workout in my household - regular use and always put in the dishwasher. No chipping or other problems. Well worth the price."
"Corelle makes a good, non-toxic, made in the USA product. I bought twelve plain white ones. These bowls are so great, perfect for cereal, perfect for ice cream, perfect for every day, worry free, no-fuss use. The kids can use them and I don't worry about chips or breaks, they are very sturdy. The are very smooth-- spoons won't make that scraping sound that they do on stoneware. Lead free. Dishwasher and microwave safe. Thank you, I got rid of all my 'nice' bowls (don't worry, these are plenty nice!) and I will be using these for the remainder of my life course."
"Perfect! Got rid of my stone wear as it was too heavy & took up too much room in my cabinets. I'm almost 70 now & becoming a minimalist. These are beautiful, lightweight, durable, & easy to hand wash or load & unload in the dishwasher. I love that they are lightweight, compact in the cabinet & beautiful on the table. The luncheon size is perfect for me & the dinner plates for when I entertain or need a platter for cookies, etc. Highly recommend if you need lightweight, durable, space saving dinnerwear."
"We kept running out of cereal/salad bowls even though we have 3 sets of our Corelle pattern. Decided to spend the $ and we are so glad we did. Now we have more than enough bowls. Someone asked if these are genuine Corelle ware -- I can't prove that they are, but they sure seem to be and they have the same label on the bottom as my other ones."
"You would almost think these were melamine from the weight, but they're a special high-tech engineered glass that is strong, light, tough, chip resistant and beautiful. I would guess they've done the sort of ion substitution they do to toughen shower doors, where the surface is under compression and the center is under tension, which keeps cracks from being able to form. Whatever they do, these are impressive dishes, very good price, and best of all MADE IN THE USA. Very happy with them."
"Years ago I had a stack of these Corelle bowls left over from a dish set. Gradually over time we dropped them and lost a few. They are such versatile bowls that I missed them, so was thrilled to find them again. They are 18-ounce bowls, we use them for small bowls of cereal and snacks. They nest really well, so the stack is short and does not take up much space beyond the footprint. Love them!"
I have used Corelle ware for MANY years (I'm old and I've used it since I was a kid). I have used them all my adult life (about 38 years). I just bought a few more bowls (and salad plates too) because my mother-in-law now lives with us and we started running out of these before it was time to run the dishwasher. I'm so glad we chose to go with plain white. You can't tell the difference between the old ones and the new ones. Now we never run out! LOVE MY CORELLE!
"As long as you don’t drop and break it, these bowls will last a lifetime and are easy to clean.  We used to buy “nice” plates and bowls for company but they always got scratched and messed up. Finally we decided our Corelli “every day” plates and bowls were nicer than the ones we bought as nice.  These bowls aren’t fancy china but they handle the refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, sink, knives, spoons, forks, cutting, scraping, etc without a blemish. Half of our bowls like this are hand me downs from parents. You can’t tell the old ones from the new ones we just bought because there are no blemishes, no discoloration, no scratches, and so on. The old ones look just they did when they were purchased over 40 years ago."
"This is a fine quality bowl. We have one old Correlle bowl to compare it to. Not sure how got the old one as we never had a set, but the old one has lasted many years, and the new ones are identical except the insignia on the bottom is different. These fit easily in our dishwasher, which is big plus. Frankly, we use the bowls for everything but size wise they are better for soup and cereal rather than pasta and salad."
"I have many dishes, but mostly, they are larger than I like for my morning yogurt and fruit. I don't really need 6 of them, but Amazon only sells them in groups of 6. At least, I don't have to worry about any mishaps because of all the spares. I chose the plain white because it will go with everything else I have. Truthfully, if Amazon sold a single, I would have only bought one."
"These bowls are an ideal size for cereal and they're easy to clean and keep looking nice. In general they're very durable but be forewarned, if you hit the edge of one just right on a hard surface slivers of glass can flake off or the whole bowl could shatter. I've used Corelle for many years and this hardly ever happens but it's something to be aware of."
I love Correlle and have used it for years! These bowls are my most frequently used item so I decided to order more. It was indicated I would get 6 bowls but I received 5 and one of them was cracked in half. It was packed in a box with no insulation and then mailed in an envelope Strange for glass bowls.  Update: the company quickly corrected the error. Fantastic Customer Service!!
Made in USA. Hygienic and easy to clean because they're made of tempered glass. Lightweight and compact stacking. Good size. Has a reputation for durability.  I bought these because the earthware bowls I had were starting to smell even after cleaning.
"I love Corelle dishes, we were gifted a serving bowl and I was so impressed with how well it stood up to the last few years of mishandling by kids etc, I promised to only buy Corelle from now on. These cereal bowls are perfect size, weight and look and with the specail offer right now an excellent investment. You wont be disappointed,no chips, no scratches, no breaks. Happy Eating!"
"Pure white dishes show off your food much better than something with a print on it. Most restaurants know this. Any of the Corelle dishes and serving bowls have the same glass tempering to make them strong, they are lightweight and stack together perfectly and are great for people with less cupboard space. The also wash up easily by hand or in the dishwasher. The only thing is they are rather expensive."
Happy to replace my Rae Dunn bowls with these. I was tired of them getting super hot. These bowls get warm but not scolding like the ceramic ones do. Hold just as much as my Rae Dunn bowls did but take up half the space. Very pleased.
"I thought these were the same as the white, open-stock Corelle bowls that I purchased at Walmart, but they are half as deep. However, they are useful for dips and such. I would not call this a cereal bowl or a salad bowl. Either I was sent the wrong size, or there is another size out there that is the mega-cereal-salad bowl. Back to the drawing board."
Finally broke some butterfly gold Corelle made in the 70's or 80's. I dropped a stack of bowls. These bowls seem slippery compared to older Corelle (again I dropped the old ones). These bowls seemed a lot more expensive than the last time I bought replacements at an outlet mall and non Corelle knock offs at big box store are half the price. If they last 40 years it is worth it.
"I could not find just the bowls anywhere locally. All were packaged in a set which I didn't need. The price was good and shipped to my front door was SO convenient. I bought the ""soup bowls"" several months ago for the same reasons as this. A great shopping feature to get just the dishwater pieces one wants."
"These bowls are exactly the right shape I wanted, they're super lightweight yet durable, easy to clean, and they don't absorb a bunch of heat so I can take them out of the microwave without burning my hands. Absolutely love them, 10/10."
"This is our second time buying this bowls. After we used these brand name, we get rid of the bowls of other brands. The shape and size of these bowls are perfect for dish washer. The surface of this bowl are very smooth and easy to get cleaned. Perfect product."
"All of our dishware is Corelle. I have had them since we got married 20 years ago. They have been through the washer, dropped on the floor and still no chips or anything. Our dishwasher rack was starting to rust through the plastic and it did stain the edges of the dishware but we were able to scrub it off and they are good as new. I bought these because our family is expanding and we need more in the cabinet! Ours our white but my sister got ones with print on them many years ago, and they are just as good! Highly recommend!"
"Gradually, over the years, the numbers of our earthenware/ceramic bowls and plates diminished as they were broken. But not one piece of Corelle ware did, so it was an easy choice for replacement bowls! They're thinner to, so more pieces fit in a given are too."
I really like these bowls over other bowls. Reasons: - Doesn't break or chip - Stacks very nicely - A stack of 10 of these bowls will be lower than a stack of 3 of my other type bowls - Good size
I bought this because I'm so sick of chipped bowls. Best thing about this is that it doesn't have lead. I worry about my other dishes but Corelle Products don't ever have lead in them.
I have been looking to add to my set which has 18oz Corelle bowls however it seems there are 2 styles and online it is very hard to get a good size comparison so I thought I would upload some images. Note that this is the smaller of the 2 bowls. I am still looking to find the larger version. Hope this helps others make the right choice.
"These Corelle bowls are as light as can be. This is great for me since I can no longer lift and carry my favorite (heavy) ceramic dishes. I hate using paper or foam dishes because they are so wasteful and damaging to our planet plus they are plain ugly when having company over to dinner. The white Correlle looks great with any type of table setting from casual barbecue to formal dinner. It is pretty durable; however, when it breaks, it breaks into shards and a gizillion tiny splinters."
I love Corelle products. I can clean my bowls with almost any and I don't have to worry about damaging them. The bowls are easy to clean because they are durable and sturdier at the same time. This brand of dishes has been around over 40 year or since I can remember.
"We've had a small stack of these for years and never fully realized how valuable they were to our morning routine. Now we have six more and won't run low before it's time to run the dishwasher. They're lightweight, affordable, the perfect size for cereal, easy to clean, stack well and they actually look nice inside our glass-front cabinets."
"1 broke during shipment. I don’t understand why they don’t pack these better. However Amazon responded to my complain any sent a whole new set which more than made up for my 1 single broken bowl. The bowels are outstanding, durable, light weight yet simple beautiful and stack perfectly. Highly recommend."
I've always loved Correll ware. It's so durable. It can go to frig & microwave in secs without breaking. Even dropping these don't usually break. I recommend these bowls highly.
"I liked that they stack compactor in the cupboard, they are microwave safe, they are deep enough to hold ample contents, such as cereal and milk, ice cream, salad, etc. They are usable with any china, as they are strong, yet have a delicate look when serving or setting a table."
"Corelle really is the best. My mother had these bowls all my life since I can remember. She passed away a few years ago and I just had to find them. These are the exact same bowls, exact same shape, they fit together so perfectly you could fit a hundred of these in the smallest of cupboards. I have dropped these bowls a million times and only a few times did they break. They are not unbreakable but they are extremely tough, bowls and plates twice and quadruple their thickness by other manufacturers break way easier than these tanks.  Fast shipping, great packaging, no chips, arrived in perfect shape."
Got these to go with my Corelle dishes Portoino. They a better size than the small bowls that came with the dish set. These are better suited for soups and cereal. Easy cleaning through the dishwasher. I would buy them again.
Like Correlle because they don't get super hot when in the microwave. These bowls are small & shallow. Utensils can easily fall out of the bowl. I should have got a 20 or 24 oz but I'm kind of an idiot when it comes to how big 18 oz are in a bowl size. lol.
"These are excellent, affordable and MADE IN THE USA, which is a positive for me. I have had Corelle bowls for many years and they never disappoint with their affordability, choices of pattern and shape and did i say they are MADE IN THE USA?"
"I love these bowls. Easy to clean, can be put in the microwave and hard to break. They are light weight too. You just can't go wrong with Corelle."
"I love those cereal plates, or whatever you want to serve in them! They don’t break!!! They are Corelle, so it does not need any explanation why I like them so much!"
"Easy to clean & very durable if you don't drop them, especially on tile floor. Much more expensive than originally bought needed to fill in set after drops."
These bowls are great for daily use and very durable (unless you drop them on tile floor or put them on a hot burner). The set we have has lasted over 10 years and I used very similar dishes when growing up for as long as I can remember. Had to buy more bowls after 2 broke after dropping on tile floor. They've been dropped on wood and laminate floors many times before without even a scratch. They've never stained and are very easy to clean.
"I love Corelle. It's a known to be a very durable product. But 2 of the bowls were broken in our original order. Getting a replacement was seamless and got no hassle. I'd order from here, again."
"You can get cheaper bowls from the dollar store and any box box store, but those bowls are thicker, heavier and easier to break than the Corelle bowls. The 18 ounce bowls are the perfect size for breakfast and soups. If you want a bowl that lasts and doesn't crack or break easily than stick with Corelle. They don't disappoint."
"I love every couple of years and need a durable and light weight set of dishes. I am also clumsy so I break way less of these. I love simple functional items, so the plain white is perfect for me. I have them out on an open shelf for ease of use and they match everything from my antiques to modern decor. I also love the affordable price of Corelle dishes!"
I have no complaints. The order came on time and the product was excellently packaged. I’ve been using these daily for a couple of months now. They are holding up. Living up to the Corelle quality.
"I bought my first set of these more than 30 years ago and they sre still my daily use. Bought another set recently and delighted to find out they are still made in USA and exactly the same as my 30 year old set. These are perfect in size for multipurpose usage, strong enough to last forever, simple shape for easy cleaning and thin light for space saving storage. I have a stack of 50 Corelle plates for large party and they only take up a small space, perfect."
"My family complains that these bowls are not really big enough for morning cereal, but there is a whole lot less wasted cereal and milk in my house! They are plenty big! I am 280lbs and it is enough. They clean well, refuse to chip, and stack both in the cabinet and in the dishwasher VERY well."
"Bowls have such a clean, crisp look but were packaged stacked together without padding in-between or in the cardboard box, so that one of them was shattered in transport. If it was more than one I'd be returning them for a refund."
A perfect ramen bowl.
The photos and video are very helpful. We look forward to years of use and happy to dispose of the chipped/cracked bowls we were using. I feel much safer overall with these bowls (lead free).
"Exactly what I was looking for! They are the perfect color, size, and weight.  Perfect for salads, soup or cereal. Best of all they go well with my new dining room set. Definitely buying another set!"
"These bowls are nice and deep and wider at the top for easy access. Perfect size for every portion of each meal I choose. If you're like me and are a bowl holder while you eat, you will find that this bowl fits perfectly in your hand, not over wide at the bottom. I'm so happy with these. Now I need to get the matching salad bowl."
"These are exactly what I was hoping for. They are large, sturdy, and easy to clean. The slanted edge makes it easy to hold. Also, this particular type of porcelain--or whatever material they use, holds temperature well, meaning if you put hot soup or microwave it, it won't completely burn your hands. I researched these extensively. Would definitely buy again."
"I bought these bowls specifically to serve homemade ramen, and they are the perfect size for a decent portion of ramen. I also use them for salads. They stack nicely for storage, too."
"I loved these bowls because their bigger than the average 16-20 oz bowl. The shipping estimated over a month but I did the purchase anyways because it was the only style I could find that was similar to my existing dining set. It only took a week to arrive!  We have been using them for about a month now and they are very sturdy, no chips or cracks either."
"I've had these for about a month now and they've become my favorite bowls. They're listed as 32oz capacity, but 4 cups takes it to the brim. I tend to fill to about 2.5 cups.  These have been easy to hand-wash, but have done well on the bottom rack of the dishwasher (I've done this once so far) as well.  Pics 1 and 3 show the bowl with 20oz (2.5c) Pics 2 and 4 show the bowl with 24oz (3c)"
"Our whole family loves these! From our cereal addict to our pho officionado, these bowls are large enough to be useful for just about everything. And they stack well in the cupboard, due to their flat bottoms! They're a little too large to fit in the top rack of our dishwasher without hogging all the space. That is their only drawback. Beautiful, classy, perfect!"
"UPDATE: Jun 6 2021: I just had to come by and update my earlier review of these bowls. They are a perfect size for creating ""bowl"" meals. Last night I had rice, veggies, hummous, and some meat. Enough room to toss it in bowl or pile in as is. If you're worried about portion control, then watch how you fill this bowl. *wink* They wash up nicely by hand or by dishwasher. They are nice to look at and work with so many meals. Repeat: ""Worth the investment!"" ========================================== Earlier review: My husband really likes these bowls. He and I are very impressed with them. No chips, no warps, no cracks, and they DO HAVE THE MFR LOGO on the bottom. After reading other reviews, it was the first thing I looked for when I unwrapped. I think they are worth the investment."
I was in the habit of buying the plastic bowls in different colors that would peel after microwave use. I bought these bc my children love to cook noodles in microwave and they are deep enough to avoid spills! They are really durable and cute!!!
"Great soup bowls with a sturdy base. Solid material, easy to wash and clean, and sold at a fair price."
Love the brand thus far! This is my second Dowan bowl purchase and I really love my other set. Beautiful white dishes that I can throw in the dishwasher!
"I bought these for a family member who always complained that the 12 to 20-ounce sized bowls just didn't hold enough cereal and by the time milk is added, and you try to take your first bite the cereal is falling over the sides of the bowl. The Dowan 32-ounce size is working perfectly! It allows for a large portion of cereal, as well as adding as much milk as needed, without the cereal escaping every time you remove a spoon full. This 32-ounce sized bowl can also be used to serve vegetables at dinner time. Versatile and the perfect size. These bowls will be used often!"
"It’s soup season and these fairly large bowls are great for a hearty helping. They came nicely packaged, no damage. They stack fairly well and have a small enough base to hold comfortably."
Nice larger size bowls. I purchased for to serve larger portions of everything.
I bought these to replace some really old bowls I had and really love them! The porcelain color is on the warmer side of white. They are microwave and dishwasher safe. The tall sides help keep food from spilling and they have a nice weight to them without being overly heavy.  I got some matching plates from the same brand and they work well together.
"Great quality porcelain, very light and elegant ,Nice size both for soup and small portions of salad, great price. I use these bowls for everything.Highly recommended."
"You can use these for hot food or cold food. Even a sandwich will fit in them, if it is standing up sideways. They have a glossy glaze. Any kind of food easily washes off the bowls without staining. They are large, but not too heavy. Easy to hold in your hands. They look pretty and you can stack them. Everything is good about these bowls."
These bowls are perfect for serving ramen. Would order again
"I bought my son(who's in college) two sets of these bowls after he told me he & his roommates needed bowls for cereal, spaghetti, etc.. They're boys so they needed something that's durable and bigger than usual. They arrived all in one piece so the packaging is well done. They look just like the picture and are a nice sized bowl (which is specifically what I was looking for). They stack well so they won't take up a lot of space in my son's tiny college kitchen. As far as microwaving and putting these in the dishwasher goes....we'll just have to wait and see. Overall I think they're great bowls."
"I have been using this bowl for about a month now and am very happy with it. If you like cereal, a banana, some fruit, and milk for breakfast you suffer from the problem I did, most cereal bowls are too small. These 32 oz bowls are perfect, deep, and wide enough not to spill. They have held up well in the dishwasher, no chips or cracks after a month. I recommend these bowls."
"I love the quality of these bowls and the fact that they are so easy to stack in the cupboard. Even though they listed the dimensions on the website, I was surprised at just how large a 7"" bowl is, so they are just a little larger than I'm used to, but that's on me."
"EDIT: They sent us a whole new package of bowls after contacting their customer support. Quick and painless too. These bowls are great too, the perfect size for stuff like ramen or soup, or for holding snacks! Updated to five stars!  Really disappointed about this. The bowls themselves are really nice, easy to clean, nice and big without being too heavy. But one of our bows arrived totally shattered. I'd like to keep the three bowls we got intact, since they're fine, but I really would like a replacement bowl, or at least some of my money back."
I really like these bowls. They are the perfect size and weight. I like the shape. They are big enough to fit a big can or serving of soup without spilling over. They go with everything. They are easy to clean and go in the microwave. Just exactly what I wanted!
"Have had for several months now. Still look brand new. Granted they don’t get heavy wear as we mostly use them for soup or as mixing bowls, but some dishes etch over time in a dishwasher, and these have not so far. Heavy, but not overly so, solid, durable, smooth, flawless. Great size for phô too."
These ceramic bowls feel sturdy and are wonderful for Ramen and Soups. Once cleaned they stack securely. They are thick enough to slowly then gently radiate the heat of the contents. Keep the meal warm a reasonable period of time. All white and sheen are consistent. Good Value!
Just a little heavy.......
"Great bowls and makes serving ramen in them, that much more stylish."
"I needed white bowls for salad, soup & pasta. They are a good size in diameter & depth. Very satisfied. Highly recommend."
"Not to big...not to small. Just right for soups, salads, pasta, ice-cream deserts and such. The bottom and the top are just the right size in relation to height. The weight is good also. Very easy to clean and dish washer safe. Can be used in microwave also. I recommend and would buy again."
"So glad I got these bowls. They are of the perfect size and shape for a good portion of soup, noodles, salad, rice, cereal, pasta, or anything. I use it both for serving and for individual use. Simple, elegant, sturdy, easy to hold, easy to wash. No negatives. In fact, I ended up not ordering other bowls because I realize these cover all my purposes."
These bowls are a classic look with a bit of modern thrown in. They are sturdy and can be used for just about anything you would use a bowl for. They were bigger than I thought they would be. I really like them and would purchase them again.
"I looked at a lot of different options for white porcelain bowls to replace ones that succumbed to 9 months in quarantine with our kids. These bowls from Dowan looked to be the exact size and more modern shape that I was looking for. They will be perfect for cereal, soup, pasta, salad, anything really. Most of what I looked at were too small, but I'm very impressed with these. They look like they will serve us well -- if our kids can keep from being rough with them!"
"Great size, solid hefty Bowls. Perfect size for pasta, rice or any other meal. Larger size really comes in handy. Easy to clean. Perfect for microwaveing. New go to Bowls for anything."
These bowls arrived ahead of schedule and were padded so well they could have been delivered by a drone. This an excellent product - microwave and dish washer safe - their appearance and function indicates to me that they should be retailed at a higher price.  Steve Morris
"Stylish design and great size for noodles soup, I wasn't think I would use that so often because the size but ended up I have been using a lot and just bought another set!"
"These are the perfect bowls for soup and stews. At this time of year, with all the snow and ice we’ve been getting, I am making a lot of hot soup dishes and these are the perfect size. I highly recommend them."
"The bowls arrived very fast in a somewhat unimpressive package. But the product was protected well and there’s no damage at all. The size, color, texture are all as expected. We’ve been using them, which are great for big bowls of noodles, etc. We tested it in microwave oven and it functions great. The water in it was hot and the bowl was cool to touch. Great value."
"After reading countless 5 start reviews on Amazon, I decided to order these and see for myself as I was in need of some larger bowls. I was looking for bowls that are modern, simple and sturdy enough for daily use. Glad to say, these are exactly what I was looking for and more! I’m really impressed with the quality and the affordable price tag, I’ll be ordering more from DOWAN."
"These are attractive, pure white porcelain bowls that hold 4 cups of liquid or food. We use them for ""build a bowl"" meals and they are the perfect size. My husband loves them for his big bowl of fruit and oatmeal. They are so pretty and useful that we ordered a second set and gave our ""standard"" sized bowls to Goodwill. Highly recommended."
"Up until now we've been using the big Chinese restaurant bowls for ramen, hot pot, and similar. These hold just two ounces less, but they stack more efficiently and got better in cupboards. The shape and share are attractive. So far they are very sturdy."
Bought these and threw away all my mismatched chipped bowls. These are pretty sturdy and nice looking. Great size for soup or cereal or salad. Just really great all around.
What a great purchase. While eating out of these bowls gives a feeling of nostalgia. A sense of warm inviting hugs from each bite. Easy to hold and gives you the right amount of portion. The only thing that could make this better is a lid to cover unfinished food Love them
It’s an every day salad or cereal bowl that is larger than the typical bowls that come in sets. I never used to have enough room for the amount of salad I would have liked in my bowl and now I do
"I needed some bowls for fruit, vegetables, cereal, etc. The dishes arrived carefully wrapped. Of course, I do not know anything about the safety of the materials used to make the bowls. On the surface, I am very pleased that I bought them."
"We like everything about these bowls. Perfectly sized. We use these for popcorn, salad, spaghetti, stew. I hand wash and nothing sticks."
"That is right, I still eat cereal as a grown man. It is actually dessert after a regular breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Weird I know, but these are some nice bowls for those of us that don't like plastic or metal bowls."
We really like these - perfect size for soup; easy to clean (and they don't discolor); no chip or cracks after months of use.
"Love these deep sturdy bowls,worth every penny…might buy more soon. Can’t find these anywhere else.thx Amazon"
"My kids like to eat large bowls of cereal. These bowls are a hit. Great size for growing boys. So far no chips, cracks or stains. Even though I encourage them to go easy, we go through dishes. Something about dropping or putting them in the sink to hard. So far so good."
"I bought them on a whim, and then had to go back for more the next week. Now I need even more because my sister and my daughter both wanted them, too. We use them daily for a hundred different things ... soup, cereal, rice bowls, spaghetti, food prep, storage. Sturdy, useful, and they fit perfectly in my dishwasher. Thank you, Dowan!"
My family love these bowls so much. They call these there pretty bowls. They are large enough for anything. We use these bowls every day. The are a nice large size and beautiful white. These are very durable and great quality.
"I've only used them once, but the size is perfect, & while the bowl gets hot in a microwave, the food does too - unlike glass bowls, where the bowls heat up, but not the food. The look really good, too."
"These bowls are fantastic! Great for cereal, ice cream, pasta, sushi bowls, salads, soups, and more! LOVE these bowls! Being a minimalist family, we use them constantly because they are the only bowl set we own! They work great for everything, look great, and make the food look great!"

I love these. They are nice big bowls! Exactly what I was looking for and competitive price!’  Thank you!
"I love these bowl's! Their easy to clean. Perfect for salads, cereal anything. Super easy to clean and sturdy. I will be ordering more."
"It was time for us to get different bowls and these are perfect! They are great for soup, salads, cereal, etc. Good quality and deep bowls. Easy to clean."
Exactly what I wanted. I wish the company name didn’t wash off the bottom so fast (after 5 washings) as they will be difficult to know brand to replace if needed.
I had debated about what size to get but found these are perfect for our family pho nights.
A restaurant we frequent serve their salads in a large bowl. I like it so much I went looking for some for us to use at home. The large size allows you to fill bowl up only 2/3 of the way and have room to not spill salad when eating. Love them!
I bought these because they are the like corelle dishes. I am a corelle dish owner for years and it seems that they are now so expensive. These bowls are very nice and go with my current corelle dishes.
finally a descent sized cereal bowl that you can use for salads as well
Purchased mostly for large salads. My plates and small bowls were not cutting it. These bowls are great.
"These are fantastic pure white bowls. I've also purchased the plates which come in a set of six. The bowls come as a set of 4. The price is a bit more than I would have liked to pay, but I do love them.  I wish they had more pieces."
"Great bowls, I was expecting a smaller “just for cereal” size, but luckily they are a bit bigger and perfect for ramen as well! Does well in the dishwasher. I’m a fan."
"These bowls are great. We're using them for almost everything. Great product, highly recommend."
"Yes!!!! They were delivered unbroken. Exactly what was advertised. I’m in love with them. Don’t remember if they are dishwasher safe or not, but I washed them by hand, only 4 so no biggie. Definitely recommend!!☺️👍🏻👍🏻"
Highly recommend this bowl. It has a stylish look to it and it’s a perfect dinner size bowl (we like to use it as a noodle or rice bowl). Easy to clean and durable enough to last a long time!
"i was confused as to how big the bowl actually was from reading the description, reviews, and even other peoples pictures. So I took my own. The bowl has 2 cooked packages of ramen inside. it can easily hold 3. Very large bowl.  Another positive: the base has a circle of raised plastic lifting the bowl about 2/3 of an inch off the table. The positive about this is you can hold onto the bottom of this. If your bowl has boiling liquid in it, its very easy to carry because its so high and theres such a large buffer of insulation on the bottom to carry.  The last part is the weight. To me, I dont care. It is very light for a bowl this size though. Some people might not like it, as premium things are generally heavy. I think the bowl is premium and light at the same time in my opinion.  very good bowl for the price."
I am very much addicted to making Pho and REAL Ramen soups. I have some other heavy bowls. But this is now my favorite. No matter how hot my broth is I can still pick up this bowl. Be it coming from a few minutes in the microwave heating left over broth to almost a boil. Or pouring my soup in boiling from the stove. It's still easy to handle. It's big enough that I don't have to get up and keep going back to the stove to refill my bowl anymore. Easily the size of 2 of my hands. I've also used the top rack of the dishwasher to clean these. And they are fine. I'm buying more right now. So glad I found these.
"I love this bowl! Hand wash it. Never put it in the dishwasher or microwave. It’s a very light plastic, and you can tell it’ll melt if overheated. Also, if you serve yourself super hot soup, the entire thing gets hot, so be careful. I like it too serve myself snacks and light meals, or salads. Just please keep in mind it’s a very very thin plastic, so I wouldn’t fill it up with hot soup and walk around with it lol I would recommend it for the large light convenient bowl, but keep these warnings in mind."
"I love this bowl! It holds (super easily) an entire package of stovetop junk food ramen, veggies, and meats (if you choose to add them) with room left over! It’s also surprisingly durable, which being as lightweight as it is I didn’t expect. It was shipped to me in amazon’s plastic wrap bags (instead of a box..), and it survived amazon, USPS, delayed shipping, AND being shoved in my mailbox. For the price, this seriously can’t be beat! I highly recommend this for any ramen lovers stuck at the Quarantina Wine Mixer."
"Perfect size for ramen noodles. Can fit two packages of ramen with added eggs and frozen veggies. I have put it in top rack dishwasher and seemed ok but i don't know about durability. I bought some ladle type soup spoons with it as well and the combo works well. Make sure to get the spoons with ""hooks"" because the other kind is too small for this bowl and just slides to the bottom of the bowl. The bowl worked in the microwave and got warm but i was able to get the bowl out of microwave barehanded without burning myself. Very light melamine type material and has a bit of flex to it. Not rigid like some other melamine/plastic material but sturdy enough to hold a bowl of soup. Not for formal place setting. More for very casual, sitting in front of tv, dorm type setting."
"I work late evenings and graveyard shifts, requiring me to make do with easy to make processed foods more often than not. This bowl really is just right for instant noodles. I buy the larger Korean brand stuff and they fit just perfectly in this bowl. Claims that the bowl doesn't heat up in the microwave are complete BS, of course it does, it's a bowl containing boiling liquid, of course it's going to be warm. But it does stay at a manageable level and isn't hard to hold it just right so it doesn't burn your hands taking it out."
"This bowl is exactly what I was looking for. It has a very large capacity, enough to reasonably fit 2 whole packages of ramen as well as 2 cans of Campbell's Chunky Soup. The bowl is a durable plastic and holds up perfectly in both the dishwasher and the microwave. The bottom of the bowl has a raised ""lip"" which keeps the hot bowl from coming in contact with surfaces, including your fingers. I would recommend this bowl to anyone and plan to purchase more myself."
"This is great for ramen or anything else you want to use a big bowl for, but I bought it specifically for noodles. It will hold a pack and all the extra goodies you want to add. Very good size, love the color, there isn’t anything bad I could say about it. Very durable as well. I plan on buying more."
"It's exactly what I was looking for when I purchased it. It's microwave safe, holds an adequate amount of liquid for cooking or consuming ramen. The shape is form fitted for holding in your hand while slurping away lunch.  And it's stylish with its minimalistic black and red color scheme."
"These bowls are beautiful and super sturdy. I love using them for my pasta meals, cereal, salad and fruit."
"I absolutely love this bowl for one simple reason: it's microwave safe. I use this bowl to cook spaghetti in my microwave, leaving it in there for about 12 minutes with it about half filled with water. There's no boil over (where other cups and bowls I've used tended to leave a puddle in my microwave later). It's also safe to touch after the 12 minutes despite the contents being piping hot by grasping the top and bottom lips of the bowl.  I've included a picture of the bottom of the bowl because it's all in Japanese..."
"I eat noodles lots i was looking for light durable plastic bowls because i was tired of using tupperware as they tend to funk up after a while. These are wonderful, big enough and handle the dishwasher well i just wish they came with lids other than that great noodles and soup bowls. I highly recommend them."
"A great bowl that can hold soup, rice, noodles, and anything else. It is big enough to hold a lot of stuff but doesn't take up too much layout space."
"Very sturdy, deep bowls. Dishwasher and microwave safe is a plus! Holds a couple cups of soup!"
This bowl is a the perfect size and it is built so well that it seem like it would last a lifetime or more!
Thin yet durable. Large enough to easily fit two packages of ramen (for the person who wants a lot of sodium for a very low price). Since it is plastic you can unfortunately scratch it with your fork but overall it is surprisingly durable and an excellent product for the price.
"It always gets white stuff stuck to it when I put it in the dishwasher no matter what detergent I use so I have to always wash it by hand. But it's sturdy, just the right size, doesn't tip over, and doesn't get blisteringly hot in the microwave. It's my favorite bowl now."
"This bowl is fabulous. I eat nearly everything out of it, including soup, fruit, chips, cereal, salad, and noodles, and it rises to the challenge every time. I wanted a really deep, versatile bowl, and this fits perfectly. I plan on buying lots more of these lovely bowls."
"Been using these for about 2 months so far and they are definitely my favorite bowls. Large enough for a savory bowl of ramen, soup, or cereal. I've used them in the microwave and washed them through the dishwasher once or twice (usually handwash) and they have survived unblemished."
This has been great for me many uses for it... From roman noodles to my favorite katudon even a big bowl to mix in and have cereal in or a large breakfast. Buying more soon having a Katudon party in the spring. (Katudon means fryed on rice. In this case pork!)
"Bought as part of a ramen themed big box Christmas present 🎁. It looks good, has a nice weight to it and seems sturdy"
Bought two and use them all of the time. Going to buy two more.
"Doesn't heat up in the microwave and I've put it in for 5 minutes. Easy to hold and clean. I don't have a dishwasher so I don't know for sure if it's dishwasher safe, but I would assume it is. Light weight but still sturdy for being plastic."
"Perfect size for a brick of ramen (and for popcorn/other snacks because I have trouble limiting myself), I use it all the time. I don't know if it's microwave safe but I've been using it like that and there's been no melted plastic or anything."
"I used it almost every day for 6 years and the inside is starting to wear off. The outside of the bowl does not get hot in the microwave, like ceramic does. Easy to clean. Will order more and retire the old one."
Great bowl
"My kids love ramen noodles so I've been searching for years for a microwave safe bowl that is large enough to hold one package of noodles. This is it!  This bowl is rather thin and very light weight but it's a generous size. It holds a whole package of ramen noodles with some room left at the top to avoid sloshing and spills. It's an attractive black with red interior, but the plastic scratches easily and I'd imagine they won't be pretty for long. However, they are perfect for our needs and I'm delighted to find them.  They don't heat up in the microwave and although the hot ramen inside will transfer heat to the bowl, you have time to get the bowl from the microwave to the table before that happens. This makes it safer for my 10 year old to make his own noodles.  If you have ramen lovers in your house, these bowls will make them happy!"
"Great bowl, use it pretty much every day. Light in weight, good size, shape of bowl is good. Also inexpensive. Great bang for your buck."
"I really like this bowl. It's light, super easy to clean, holds a lot of food, doesn't get hot at all so easy to hold."
"Does what it says on the tin: it's a bowl, it's plastic, and it will hold a whole lot of soup and/or noodles."
"Love ramen which it is mostly used for, but great for salad and cereal. Can go in the washing machine or hand washed as well as the microwave. I really love these bowls actually."
Light and looks good. Bigger than I thought. Great for all kinds of soup
I absolutely love this bowl. I was stationed overseas in Korea and started to really love the spicy ramen noodles (which I incidentally found on Amazon too). This is the perfect bowl and fits the round noodles straight out the package without having to break up the noodles. It also is more than big enough to keep the noodles from boiling over in the microwave and what's even better is that won't leave an ugly red stain and ruin my other clear plastic Tupperware or storage containers!
I just wanted an extra large soup/cereal bowl. Haha that’s exactly what I got. It’s plastic so it also washes very easily. Product Approved! :)
I've only spilled soup on my cat once. Also it doesn't get too hot to hold with very hot soup inside. Easy to clean. Light weight. Versatile.
We adore these bowls. We purchased 2 and you can fit an amazing amount of food in this. It holds 2 packs of Ramen and 2 halves of egg and alot more. These bowls are fantastic. Microwave safe and dishwasher safe.
Exactly as described! Nice size bowl and better than expected!
These bowls are pretty and microwaveable and dishwasher safe. I will update in a few months if they are holding up. I bought three of them. I eat hot soup and noodles as well as rice.
This is perfect size for ramen noodles. It takes about 5 minutes in the microwave. It arrived promptly and as described. It comes out hot but not 3rd degree hot like a glass bowl. You still need paper towel's to hold; it to be safe. Leave about 1'3/4 space. I'm buying a second bowl.
"Durable , well made and inexpensive."
I microwave food that I reheat.
I have poured boiling water into these bowls without damage to bowl. Picking up the bowl with bare fingers was a problem but great size and beautiful bowl.
thought they would be bigger like when we go out for pho but they are not. still big enough i guess.
I bought 2 of these because I was looking for a nice plastic bowl that can hold a pack of Shin Ramyun. This fits the bill perfectly. I was previously using a glass bowl because it was the only one big enough to hold the dry noodles without having to break them apart. It exterior would get very hot and I would have use mitts to carry the bowl to the table and a hot plate so it wouldn't damage the surface. I can handle these plastic ones now with my bare hands and it has a nice rim on the bottom so I can put set it directly on the table. Great buy!
"Great size, especially for ramen. Doesn't get overly hot in the microwave and it's easy to carry. We like these!"
Deep enough bowl you won't have to worry about spilling anything. Very easy to clean. I'm ordering more; this bowl is amazing!
Purchased these bowls over a year ago. Really durable and love the vibrant color. Great quality.
A good product at a fair price.
"we use these for everything! soup, cereal, salad, ice cream. They are a bit large, but that is OK. Great in the RV."
"Nice large size for pasta or soup. I think they're plastic but they look a lot like lacquer. Unlike melamine, these can go in the microwave."
Chinese takeout soups creep me out in those plastic containers I transfer soup to these bowls cover And into the microwave to heat up chili spaghetti home fries with eggs and anything else you want to put in it plenty big
"Cheap plastic bowl. Perfect for taking to work for lunch. I just leave it in my drawer. I wasn't expecting more than that, and got exactly what I was expecting. Looks exactly like the picture, feels all nice and plasticy."
This bowl is amazing! Heat your broth with noodles and enjoy! Food is cooked but the bowl remains easy to handle.
Very nice
"Deep, plastic bowl and its pretty sturdy! I just don't know if its microwavable because it is (the instructions) in Japanese I believe."
Great
A little too big
"I LOVE IT!!!! I am a ramen and asian noodle fanatic and have a matching rice bowl ^_^ cant wait to complete the set.....prolly gonna need like 5 more, at least."
Just the right size. Too many bowls are too small or too heavy. This one solves both those problems. We literally use these every day.
Love it! The perfect size ! Don’t smell if you use for a strong spice meals after washing !
I am very confused because I received two unpackaged bowls though I only ordered one...  But all in all I am happy because now I can use another bowl before cleaning the other one ;) Although the cleaning is super easy and the quality is top.
"I am so happy I ordered these large 38 oz bowls. Holds more than a quart to the rim. Thats a man sized bunch of soup or chili. We have used them twice in 3 days both for near boiling Soup. We could easily hold these bowls in our hands from Stove to Table and NOT burn our hands. WOOHOO that is so nice. ALSO, the bottom of this bowl keeps the Soup Hot, and we had to keep blowing on each spoonful. I thought it would never cool down. They came lickety split quick, so I was able to use them that night after washing of course.I do hand wash them so far. But will see if they end up in the dishwasher over time. Haven't used them in the Nuker yet either. I also got a dozen of the Spoons that match, and I forgot to try them. DUH. Added a photo so people can see the spoons are pretty right on as for the color matching. The first night we had Rigotoni n Sauce. My Son balked at using the Japanese Noodle Bowls for Pasta...He said "" It just isn't right, eating Pasta from a Noodle Bowl""...I laughed and laughed. But we all love these bowls. And the Pasta was Perfect in them. just sayin'"
I love the soup bowls !!! I have a question though ... can you put them in microwave and dishwasher???
These are such great soup bowls. I ordered the matching spoons. They are bigger than I though and that is a good thing.
Product as described nice soup bowl
I use this for everything!
"This thing is HUGE!!!.... Love this bowl I should have purchased more than one. Just wanted to make sure I was pleased wit it first. Its light, steardy, ...Awesome"
"Pretty sure I bought these same bowls in Japan for $1 each, but just glad I can get them in the US. Big size, microwave and dishwasher safe. Love these for soups."
"Microwavable, fits a whole bowl of ramen, perfect for soups. Light and easy to clean. Doesn't burn my hands when it comes out of the microwave."
"It's weird, but I really love this bowl. It's my favorite bowl. Easy to wash and clean, and durable enough to handle mild abuse."
"Excellent bowls, excellent lids. I’m not sure why people are claiming that the lids loosely sit on top, but they do not. You have to push the lids down into the bowl, they seal perfectly. Overall very very pleased with my purchase"
""
"Great product. It definitely exceeded ALL expectations, absolutely perfect. I needed to buy some stainless steel bowls but they were ridiculously expensive in every store, so i decided to try here. Based upon the reviews I just didn’t know what to expect. Some people said they were awful, others that they were great... I bought them and thought hey, I’ll keep the ones that work and toss the bad ones. Not only they were all complete with their (working) lids, but they are some of the best looking bowls out there, shiny and all. Perfect condition that you wouldn’t even find in a store for 3x the price 10/10 I have recommended it to friends and family, because they are awesome"
They are bowls put stuff in take stuff out. I guess you can use as a drums for toddlers. Colorful lids are nice they cover the bowls and they best together nicely if only my kids would bother to take the smaller bowl out before stacking the odd man out on top
"I got these to replace a large bowl from a 3-bowl Farberware set from years ago that suddenly grew a small hole at the bottom (I still have NO idea how that could have happened). I was really nervous reading the reviews but this a great set. The lids fit tightly enough that if you roll the bowl over, it doesn't leak liquid although I wouldn't leave it upside down for any length of time, but it's nice to know that the lid doesn't pop off and create a mess. The different colored lids are nice too. My only ""complaint"" is that if you don't want water spots on these, you will have to hand dry them (not that I really care but some people might)."
"I’ve been doing more cooking at home lately and realized that having more mixing bowls would be useful. I wanted something that had lids so I could use them for food storage as well if needed, and I wanted something I could put in the dishwasher. These are working out great! All the lids fit just fine and I’ve washed them in the dishwasher with no problems. They also nest together so they don’t take up much room."
"I was hesitant because of some reviews I read saying the lids don’t fit. That is completely inaccurate. These bowls are fantastic . Great sized, and the lids seal on nice and tight. I’ve had these for a few months now, and couldn’t be happier. Great buy."
"Best purchase I bought myself ever! It has so many sizes and all with lids. from the table to the frig! No scrapping them into bowls with lids! Then having to wash all the table bowls! I’m over my table looking good with glass bowls! I’m about getting it done! I have to peep into the living room where my elderly Mother sits doing her diamond dots, and tell her,‘I just love my bowls! Not only is it just 4 bowls, you get tons bowls one of every size! I’m gonna buy this agin for birthdays this year! Seriously you cook a lot, these bowls are the bomb!! This would have to be my favorite household purchase in the last 4 years! It has 100% made my life so much easier! Usually I have to look for the bowl then have to look for the lid! It all fits perfectly and takes up less room in the frig due to alllll the sizes! Well worth it! I’m going to order all my friends and family the bowls for thier Birthdays this year!!! Happy Happy Happy!"
"I absolutely love these mixing bowls! They’re light weight,so they’re easy to handle. The lids are air tight. And the bowls are dishwasher safe, which is great. The last set of stainless steel bowls I had were very heavy and hard to deal with. Having air-tight lids is really a plus. I highly recommend these bowls."
"Best storage bowls ever! While, of course, you cannot microwave it, it's other features make up for that tiny inconvenience. It's self-burping, and the bowls & lids both nest and only take up one space on shelf. There are so many of them that it's easy to find just the right size."
"What a wonderful purchase. I couldn't find a set of stainless steel mixing bowls anywhere at a decent price. These were better than I hoped for and had proper fitting strong lids for each. Don't bother looking at anyone else, just buy this set and spare yourself disappointment."
I was surprised at the beauty and quality of these bowls. The lids are great and because they are different colors it makes it easy to match to the proper bowl. The larger bowls are much bigger than expected. I couldn't be more pleased and the price was so very reasonable. Thank you so very m;uch.
One of the best mixing bowls I've purchased and with lids. Highly recommended each have a measured size and are easy to store.
"I’m so happy I bought these! They arrived quickly, love the kids and all the sizes. I was hesitant to purchase for all the negative comments and about the kids not fitting but all of mine fit good and we use these all the time!"
These bowls are amazing!  Perfect nesting means mess space invading my cupboards.  Super easy to clean. Sizes for every occasion. And LIDS!!!! Stainless bowls with LIDS!  Worth every penny!
"Love the way the bowls stack together and all the lid stack perfect on top, saving space, and can keep up with lids, best idea I have seen , will buy more of these for my catering party’s, thanks for a great product."
"I am pleased with the mixing bowls. Nice quality. I notice when storing food in the frig, the tops are not as secure due to the cold (no suction). Also, remember that the tops are not dishwasher safe. Overall, very nice product!"
If you don't have these you're missing out. This is one of the best sets of mixing bowls I've purchased and I use them for everything now.
"LOVE these bowls Bought for my girls, but I'm going to buy for myself and all my friends. You can store and cook in them. Each bowl has listed how many cups/measurements it contains."
"Easy to store. Plastic covers cleverly designed, seal tight, and also neatly nest in each other. Bowls and covers store in a minimum of precious space."
"The lids stay on tight, it’s a perfect selection of sizes and they clean easy. The bowls are great in the dishwasher. I’d recommend putting the lids on the top rack only or hand washing. I put my Purple lid on the top rack and it warped slightly but still works excellent. I’d rather just hand wash the lids."
Super nice having lids but I wish the bowls were larger for mixing purposes. For storage and serving they are great but if you make lage amounts of baking goods the bowls are not the best to leave enough room for rising when baking bread and proofing. Not the best in general for baking wise especially with a large family. Other than that we love them and are very useful
"Nice set. Very space saving. They are pretty light weight. I would be too rough with them. With the sealing lids, they are very versatile."
"Just the perfect sizes for my needs but was surprised to get one bowl out of the fridge with leftovers and the lid warped, the lid for my container of jello was fine however, hopefully the lid will flatten out after washing."
Couldn’t be happier and I’m going to throw away a ton of mishmash plastic bowls taking up way too much space!
There are lots of sizes of bowls and also an assortment of tools included. This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves them.
"Love this set, much better then the last set I brought for much more. Love the tops easy to store food away and easy to clean"
"Great set of bowls with lids, bought to use in camper. Sturdy and easy to clean. Would buy this set again"
"Huge variation of sizes and all having lids, I can use an egg beater without a scratching them. Also the lids are straight up like Tupperware style. I use to mix or break up foods in a bowl then move them to Tupperware, this is legit both, mix and break up then just slam a lid on to trap the heat or freshness"
"These are Wonderful! Perfect sizes, with lids...how Fabulous! Lightweight, sturdy, so many different sizes, the Best for Everything!"
LOVE THEM !!!! Great lids that are sturdy solid and super air-tight. I can't believe I went through life this far without them.
These bowls were exactly what I hoped for! I love that there are so many different sizes to choose from so you can use them for any and everything. I also love that each bowl has lid to make dinner leftover clean up easy. The price is right on as well. You definitely get more for your money!
"I love these bowls, just wish they had a little nonslip piece on the bottom, otherwise they are great!"
Very light weight but high quality and the variety of sizes are perfect for any kitchen
Thes bowls are not very heavy but very durable. I make salads and lock lid on and it last for 3 to 5 days!! I will gift a set!
"She has had no compaints, and having looked them over may get another set for me!"
"They are great and nest perfectly, saving a lot of space. Due to bad handling of the package one lid is cracked a bit but not unusable. Love them!"
"These mixing bowls look nice, hold up really well in the dishwasher and love the color lids that match the bottoms. I also love the different sizes this product comes in. Also worth the money."
At first glance I was thinking of returning the set but I really needed bowls and decided to keep them and order more later now. I’m so glad I gave them a try I really love everything about them
Those bowls are awesome! They are strong and great for storage.
Great bowls! Would buy again! Love the colorful lids. Fit snuggly … all the bowls fit nicely inside one another and the lids set on top of all of them together. Better than expected
I'm so glad I replaced my glass mixing bowls with these lightweight ones. They're just easier to work with. A size for every purpose. I make my focaccia in one.They come with covers too.
It is great for the price you pay. If you plan to use it for mixing it is not as sturdy and may move. I love the fact that a simple water rinse cleans it. The lid is air-tight and overall this is dishwasher safe.
"Great bowls, good shape, tight fitting lids."
"We use these for everything. Mixing bowls, leftover storage, food prep… And they nest perfectly for storage."
"I am moving out of state , these are for my new home. So I only opened to look at them, They look beautiful. But I can't review on use until I move."
Love the bowls particularly because they have lids that actually fit well.
Awesome because they nest inside one another
"Bought them for the camper, they are perfect, and pretty"
Arrived quickly and great product
Like the sizes of the bowls. Well made and nice looking.
"Overall easy to clean, to use and light"
The bowls are study and I love that they have lids to easy be put in the refrigerator or to sit on counter for later.
"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE, EXCELLENT"
I wish I had bought these sooner. Makes baking and mixing so much easier!
I love these bowls but the large one the top does not fit its very loose
These are light weight.
Great product for the cost. Extremely happy with this purchase:
"Easy to remove lids, deep bowls! Excellent!"
Muy cómodos para guardar comida
They're great to work with is it clean and to storage recommended
Good quality
"These bowls are very useful, lightweight but sturdy and easy to clean. They are good for mixing as well as storing food in the fridge and freezer."
Easy to clean. All the bowls you will need. Nice quality and fast delivery.
Love light weight and lids
"These are multi purpose and so easy to use, clean and store. An asset to any kitchen."
"Great bowls. Easy to store, everything is absolutely dishwasher safe and they’re perfect for all the cooking and baking I do."
"I love these. The bottom of the bowl match the color of the lid, so it’s very quick and easy to find. They nest in each other for easy storage. I’ve washed lid and bowl in the dishwasher and they both hold up well"
"well made, better than expected."
"a size for every need here’s a tip we put same colored postems on the outside of the refrigerator matching the seals on the bowls, you what you have and where it is before opening the door"
"I am very disappointed with these bowls that are stunning at first glance and arrival. I purchased 2 sets, as well as a similar set from goodwill that matches very well so that I would have enough bowls for my large family. All of the goodwill bowls are still in perfect condition from nor.al wear and tear. However, the majority of the bowls from these sets on Amazon are chipping and cracking like crazy. These bowls do not hold up to normal use whatsoever and I will need to throw most of them away and buy new bowls elsewhere."
""
"I just wish I could buy replacements individually. I have bought these bowls and the dining set (plates, large and small, cup and bowl), + serving bowls, garlic holder, butter holder and more. I am a big fan! The problem is the set does not have accessible replacement pieces so unless you can afford to live with 5 plates when one breaks or else buy an entire set to replace one than I do not recommend. Unless you can find where to find replacement pieces. These lovely bowls however are wonderful on their own."
"These bowls are a soft, lovely ivory color with different patterns on each of the set of 4. They're a perfect size for ice cream (unless you're my husband - ) or berries or yogurt."
"Did you ever just buy something because you wanted something really special for yourself? These bowls fit the bill. Well made and beutiful, soft design. Just a delightful purchase that I'm glad I made."
I was specifically looking for lead free bowls that would be big enough for me to microwave a large bowl of oatmeal and these bowls work well for that. I like the raised patterns on the outside of the bowls and would have bought plates as well if they had been offered in this pattern. So far they seem sturdy and have a good heft to them.
"Finding neutral embossed stone dinnerware has been a journey and these were a great find that match our other pieces. They are beautiful, weighted, and dishwasher safe. The packaging ensured that the items were safe during shipping."
"I love the texture on these bowls. Perfect size. I'm surprised at people saying these are small - it's a single serving size bowl, you're not going to fit an entire box of cereal in your bowl."
"So far, so good. Arrived not cracked or broken and well packaged. Love the simplistic design. I wish it came in more colors or had matching mugs! Great larger cereal or salad bowl."
"I gave these to my daughter and she loves them. She loves the look of them. Uses them for dips, ice cream, fruit, veggies, etc.."
"We are completely in love with these bowls! I wanted a larger volume soup/salad bowl and thought these would be okay. Oh my gosh, they are so pretty!! Exactly the size I wanted, very sturdy and so pretty. I only bought 4, so I’m going to buy four more."
Perfect small bowl. Very pretty detail. Works well I microwave and dishwasher. Wish I could buy a full dining set with same design.
These bowls are gorgeous & regular serving size.
I absolutely love these bowls! I love the designs and they’re super durable. I accidentally dropped one onto my hard tile floor and not one chip.
Perfect for constant teen snacking. Such cute but sturdy bowls.
Great quality and perfect for cereal or ice cream.
Really like these bowels. Highly recommend
Good size for cereal & soup.
I saw these cute bowls on a lifestyle blogger's account. I ordered them right away! They are the perfect size for many uses and the 4 different patterns are so cute. They look way more expensive than what they cost. Thinking about buying a second set!
"Took me a long time to find these very beautiful bowls, but the wait was worth it. The designs are subtle, pretty and also functional helping with grip."
Love the size
Perfect size and easy to clean
These bowls are pretty and large enough for a nice size serving of soup or side serving dish. I love the different patterns. Great purchase!
Reasonable price for some nice all-purpose bowls
Cute and the perfect size.
I have some other stuff from Walmart that is discontinued and this matched it perfect.
This was a house warming for my daughter's recently completed new home. Loves everything about them. Thanks
As described. Wish they stacked a little better but fine.
These bowls are perfect size for rice and so cute!
These are super cute and a great size for use on trays/boards!
"I loved these bowls for either soup, saladas, cereal etc. They are super pretty and good quality !"
I thought I was getting 4 different bowls but 2 are the same. That’s not cool.
I thought they would be bigger but they are beautiful and my kids don’t need to eat that much cereal anyway!
"Super cute, worth the purchase and love the designs"
I gave these as a gift and the recipient loves them.
Love these bowls. They are beautiful and well made.
Size is excellent.
Absolutely love these!
Perfect size for fruit or ice cream.
They’re great!
Very nice looking and sturdy bowls!
These are beautiful bowls but unfortunately they are too small for my needs I’m returning these and ordering the larger size
Nice looking bowls however the inside of some of the bowls were not fully glazed. I read this type of review before I purchased in hopes the flaw would have been corrected.
Ordered once then ordered a replacement set. Both sets had defects. The inside of the bowl is suppose to be all white. Some of the brown glaze from the outside was on the inside of two bowls. One of the bowls also had a black pitted spot. Another bowl had a raised rough spot. Returned both sets.
Love these! Just a perfect size. And pretty!
Unfortunately I had to return the bowls due to several flaws in the glazing. It looked like a small bit of cardboard was on the bowl and the glaze was applied over it. (See pic) The glaze was unevenly applied and thin in some areas.
"These bowls are tiny, good for dips but not for everyday use"
The most beautiful bowls ever! I love the colors and the designs they are everythign youd ever want. But i will say they are tiny haha. I thought they were cereal bowls but alas maybe ice cream bowls? Or good for a side of berries with breakfast. Either way theyre exsctly as pictured and vefy high quality expensive looking bowls for a very low price. Will be looking for the matching cereal bowls haha
"These are beautiful little bowls that will look great in any kitchen, with most styles of dishware. They are smaller than the usual bowls that come in sets, but are big enough for a serving. Each bowl has a different pattern, and are white with a beige color on the highlights. They would make a nice house-warming gift and would be a pretty set for anyone using portion control."
"I absolutely love this sturdy, beautiful set, with its embossed, varied patterns and generous size that's perfect for anything from cereal to salad, soup, pasta, grain bowls or more. Dishwasher, microwave, and oven safe. Well packaged and arrived undamaged. Would make a nice housewarming gift."
"Arrive today and it’s a masterpiece! Beautiful bowls that I’m so in love with! But 1 is broken sadly, hopefully they will send me a replacement of this broken bowl. The packaging needs to be more secure and padded in the future."
I love these serving bowls! They have been great for a house parties and they are absolutely beautiful. They are easy to clean and display beautifully in my china cabinet. The texture adds gorgeous detail as well.
These bowls offer a subtle prettiness to my table setting. Most of my dishes are pure white and these work well as an accent to give it a little somethin-something. Decent size for a side salad or dessert. Wash up nicely.
"I really like the various patterns on these ceramic bowls. The bowls are small at 4.5 inches, but that just helps me with portion control. They look so cute at a table setting. Highly recommended."
Perfect. Just as described and pictured. So glad I found these. I just wish there were plates to go along with them!
"These bowls are a great size for soup, cereal, whatever! Love the different designs."
"So cute, they look just like the picture. I got the smaller dipping bowls, but after seeing/feeling them and using them for a couple weeks I’m definitely going to get the bigger bowls too. They’re thick without being heavy. Such good quality. I love these so much"
just ordered 3 more 4/bowl sets as gifts.
These bowls were a great addition to my Elama Marketplace dishes.
"Displayed on open shelving in kitchen, they look great, decorative plus study. Haven’t chipped during daily use and washing."
Like these a lot! Good looking and nice size.
"Very good quality bowls, well made and great variety."
"We have several of these dishes in several sizes. Bowles, plates etc. If you use them correctly they are excellent. We use them in the microwave without any problem. We don’t cut anything on them because we don’t like cut marks on our dishes. They can also be cleaned in the dishwasher."
"I ordered this set of bowls for cereal and soup. They are great! We have had plastic bowls for years for grandkids to use when they stayed with us, but they have grown an do not spend the time here like they use to. These are very nice bowls well made and reasonably priced."
"I don't know what constitutes the best ice cream, soup, or salad bowls but I have been extremely happy with these, so much so that I had a friend buy them for his single's pad."
I love the look and feel of these bowls! Going to use them today for the 1st time for homemade ice cream. They are the perfect weight!
Good for microwave use and study. Only issue was that the seemed to have residual oil or grease after washing in dishwasher. Might be better to wash by hand.
"I love this product. Bought these for my little camper, I dont have to worry about them breaking. They're cute and dependable."
"Love that they are light weight, but still very sturdy and durable. Definitely dishwasher safe. Great value for the price."
"I love 💕 these! my go-to for my food choices. Luv their sustainability, better for our planet."
"While limited by the time in the microwave, I have enjoyed the bowls so far. I would buy these again."
Variety of colors and lightweight yet durable. Perfect size for cereal or snacks.
The natural look. The style deep & roundness of the bowls
Does the job. Doesn't hold smell or stains.
I loved these bowls...
This is the second set I ordered . They are pretty and lightweight . Dishwasher safe. Microwave safe. Great colors and perfect For the grandkids ! Love them !
Great
I love these bowls. I needed something that was easy to clean and didn't feel like they weren't clean like plastic usually does.... And these are fantastic!
Perfect ice cream bowl.
Sturdiness
"I love that are not plastic! My kids love their new bowls, and say the food taste better out of them, rather then plastic bowls. Will be ordering another set of these bowls!"
"Great bowls! Lightweight but sturdy, microwave well and I love that they are made from eco-friendly materials. My only complaint is don’t heat up tomato soup in them! I didn’t discover until after I used a 2nd bowl for tomato soup that it stained the bowl and now I have this reddish color that won’t wash off. So other than the aesthetics of a stained bowl, they are great."
"Ok first of all these adorable bowls save me so much time doing dishes, food easy slides off and they dry fast too! This is my favorite set and I've been through alot of bowls, trust me look no further if your a busy person these are for you."
"Sturdy, works well in the microwave and cleans up easy without food stain."
Great colors
Me encantan
"I saw this product on Amazon. I needed a set of large bowls for serving soups and cereals. The set was reasonably priced. I have been using these bowls ever since. They are beautiful looking in four pastel colors at the same time, they are heavy and nonbreakable. These bowls are ideal for daily use in a family with children."
"Bowls are large and sturdy, but there is no stamp or mark on bottom of bowls to say if they are dishwasher and microwave safe. Description on Amazon says they are OK in dishwasher and up to 3 minutes in microwave. Definitely should be labeled on bowls. I think they are made in China, and I did not know that until I received them."
I guess you get what you pay for. These were cheap and I know why. These are a harder plastic and not bad but I thought I was getting ceramic bowls
The wash fine in the dishwasher. They fall fine on the floor with no consequences. They’re a strong but light weight plastic. Truly microwave safe. I don’t burn my hand touching it when I grab the bowl from the microwave by the rim. I’ve bought two sets. The cups are just as good. Great product.
"These bowls are super durable, great for holding snacks or cereal, dishwasher safe. Perfect bowls for many needs."
"I had family staying with us and with them 4 children, after several broken or chipped bowls I purchased these. They are attractive and sturdy and we absolutely love them."
One of the best purchase I've made on Amazon and I make alot. Been looking for bowls like these in stores for years. But I live in a very rural area where there isn't alot of shopping.
I ordered these because theyre unbreakable. Problem is i microwaved beef soup and it permanetely stained the bowl.
"I ordeered these as a gift because I had previously ordered them for myself. I love them. They are great in the microwave, and just the right size for just about everything. I ordered 2 sizes for the gift because I love them so much."
Like that these are light weight and pretty. Unlike another review on here I ate tomato soup and they did not stain after rinsing out with Dawn
I love these dishes. I have hand pain and these are easy to hold. Plus I dislike the waste of paper plates. These are so easy to clean. Great product
"My husband loves these, as he has Parkinsons and drops dishes. I love them, colorful and great in the dishwasher!"
"Nice product but it is really plastic, it’s poly propylene which is plastic. I think the description says that it’s not plastic but in fact it is because PP is poly propylene and that is considered plastic."
These are NOT soup bowls. They are toy sized.
My family members love these bowls. Microwaveable and dishwasher safe. Size is perfect.
They are pretty n light weight
Love the size & weight of these bowls! We use for camping & they are perfect.
My son loves these.
Love price would bye a gain
Just what I’m looking for for traveling purposes
I love the product.
Very flimsy and are junk
"I absolutely loved everything about them at first, until the stains from certain foods wouldn’t come out ."
"These bowls work perfectly for hot and cold foods. Very sturdy, made with good quality material. Microwave and dishwasher safe"
Didnt think i'd like them...but Surprise!!! I love them...plan to grt more
Nicely made but a little smaller then I thought they would be. But this will help with my diet. Smaller portions. LOL
Me gustaron
"They are flaky and when first opened, had no bag and or container. Just sitting in the box. Also had black stuff and looked like brown food type crumbs inside."
Thought they were bigger
"The description is misleading, these bowls contain Polypropylene ""PP"" which is plastic. The fact that theses were ""environmentally friendly"" was a huge factor in buying these and I didn't notice until I had already purchased them. I hope this helps others make make an informed decision! They are super cute though, I love the color and they are overall good bowls."
Material makes it easier to handle when washing.
Used for grandkids with chili. Stains won’t come out
Staining which could not be removed n did not stay microwavable
A bowl that doesn’t get hot from reheating or cooking in the microwave. Very happy.
Perfect size and microwavable.
"These pretty bowls are exactly what I was looking for; bowls that are not ceramic or porcelain that can break or crack easily. I just wanted bowls for cereal, ice cream and snacks. These bowls are lightweight and are made from wheat straw fiber, hence the little black dots on the bowls. NOT ""black stuff and looked like brown food type crumbs inside."" as someone pointed out in their review. I'm happy with this purchase."
"Bought for cereal and they work great, they have some flex so need to be careful when moving with food inside bowl but they clean up easy and look like new several months later."
"Nice bowls, came on time were inexpensive and reputed to be unbreakable, not tested as of yet. Just what we needed."
"But one of the bowls edge came sharp , well i can smooth it off"
"Shelf broke last week and like Humpty Dumpty, our bowls had a big fall. Ordered these and they exactly what we needed. Lightweight, inexpensive but sturdy so far"
These are good quality and sturdy. I was looking for something that we could use for cereal rather than the heavy glass bowls we have.
Got for my mom light weight easy for her to handle
"These bulls were super cute, they work perfect dishwasher safe microwave safe highly recommend"
Microwave and dishwasher safe. Just what I was looking for.

"This bowel helps produce a Hot luxurious lather!!! First, I intended to review this bowl a long time ago, but I wanted to be sure I gave it the thorough review it deserves. The first bowl I received had a beautiful marble pattern, but it had a crack that was obviously patched at the factory. I contacted Beau Brummell, and a gentleman named Daniel requested a photo of this unusual occurrence. He immediately acknowledged that this was unacceptable, and sent me a replacement. They even allowed me to keep the bowl! It makes an attractive change bowl on the mantle. I call this superior customer service! Thank you Daniel.  The replacement bowl wasn't quite as pretty as the first, but is still nice (luck of the draw). Now, let me tell you, this bowl is heavy and retains heat extremely well to produce a nice HOT lather!!! I love it! See the pic. That temp probe was in the lather, and not touching the bowl. It went much higher when I touched the bowl (I have to hold it with a wash towel). I just ran Hot water into the bowl (yes my hot water is HOT!!) for a minute, poured most out, and started whipping. It feels SO good, to rub that into my beard!!! The only con for this bowl is, those rings on the inside are kind of rough, so if you have a pretty /expensive brush, you might scratch the HECK out of it if your not careful. Other than that minor problem, I LOVE THIS BOWL!!! Buy one NOW, and enjoy the same hot lather that I do!!"
"The top rated reviews are accurate! This pure marble shaving bowl with inner ribbed lines make for a warm and easy to lather shave. The bowl is slightly smaller than I thought from some reviewers pictures but that’s actually perfect for me and my bathroom. I can easily hold the bowl while shaving if needed and it also fits inside my bathroom cabinet at it’s current size. It is marble so don’t drop it or choose to just use it as is while sitting on your bathroom countertop. As far as shaving bowls go, after purchasing many various ones over the years I’d easily say this is my favorite. The material is high quality marble, the natural coloring of the marble is beautiful and ideal for me and my bathroom and it’s function as a shave bowl works as well as any I’ve used, if not better. If you’re looking for a marble shave bowl, spend the little bit extra on this Beau Brummell marble shave bowl and you will not be disappointed! Their customer service has also been quite good with any questions I had. Happy shaving!"
"Moved and lost (misplaced?) my shaving mug and finally got around to searching for a new one. I am pretty picky about this type of stuff, so I wanted something that wasn’t cheap looking, had a classy feel to it, and worked well. This shaving soap bowl achieves all of that.  It is remarkably heavy in the hand (which is a good thing) and looks great sitting by my sink. But nice appearance only counts if it works, and this bowl is exceptional. The inside is textured just perfectly to build a great lather when rotating the brush over it. The heavy marble like material hold the heat wonderfully. The result is a huge amount of hot foam both on the brush and in the bowl.  You poor people that spend money on shaving cream in cans/tubes just do not know what you are missing. Get this bowl, get some nice shaving soap, run some warm water into this thing and work up a great hot lather. It is life changing."
"Extremely happy with this product! This shave bowl has a fantastic visual aesthetic, even better than it appears in the pictures.  The size is exactly what I was looking for; it fits perfectly in my hand, with a good weight to it, and I really appreciate how deep the bowl is. I like to soak my brush in the bowl before I shave, and I have found many bowls are too shallow to allow soaking, as the bristles are not covered all the way. This bowl is not only wide enough to lather while still fitting comfortably in the hand, it is also deep enough for me to completely submerg the brush bristles while soaking.  I read some reviews that mentioned it was slippery to hold when wet, however, I completely disagree. The marble it is made from has a finish on the exterior that does not get slippery at all. Unless completely covered in soap, even when very wet this bowl has a good friction to it, allowing a sturdy grasp. No worries of slipping out of your hand.  I am extremely satisfied with this bowl. Would definitely recommend, and am very impressed especially considering how inexpensive it is. Great customer service, arrived early, and well packed to protect from breaking en route. Five stars"
"The Beau Brummell Solid Marble Shaving Soap Bowl is amazing. The ridges inside make soap foaming a breeze. Hint 1 fill with hot water and let it sit for 60 seconds, fill again and let it sit for another 60 seconds. you will have the warmest soap foam you have ever had for shaving, besides at a legit barber maybe. the Bowl fits well in your hand and has hefty enough weight to swirl your brush on the counter as well. I feel it is hefty enough that if I dropped it I would lose a toe before it was damaged. however, if it did break I would be ordering another one immediately. Yes its a bit higher priced than some others but I believe it is worth it, in every way. I cannot see you being disappointed with the Beau Brummell shaving bowl if you want the best tool for the job."
"This was my first bowl purchase and a nice one at that. Pros; 1. Marble takes well to hot water and retains the heat for a warm lather, 2. Ridges inside the bowl makes this bowl a lather machine, 3. A nice looking bowl, 4. Substantial weight feels solid, 5. Bottom of the bowl is just the right size to cup in hand as I create a lather.  Cons; 1. Not a travel bowl because of the material and weight, 2. Inside of the mouth opening has a squared edge instead of being rounded, makes for an uncomfortable feeling when your fingers hit the edge of the bowl when making a lather. 3. Mouth opening is somewhat small compared to other bowls, does not lend itself to be used with large (wide) brush handles, narrow brush handles work fine.  I love this bowl and when I'm using my Parker Black Badger Brush it is my goto bowl. I love the fact that this bowl retains heat and has a nice heft. A great addition to anyone's shave den."
"I have previously purchased two shaving bowls and used several bowls and mugs I have for coffee and food but at last have found what I was looking for. This is a superb shaving bowl in that it retains heat while whipping up a great lather from my soap or cream with my shaving brush. I often get as many as three applications in one shave and by the third the warmth has dissipated, but warmth isn't the only great feature. The texture inside the bowl is exactly what I need to get that great lather. It was a wonderful surprise to get lather from creams I have used previously that were nowhere near as rich. I did have to experiment with the quantity of hot water used and I found more was better than less. Is it good for travel? If you don't mind the heft its fine. I wouldn't take it backpacking but then I wouldn't be shaving on a backpack trip either. This is a wonderful shaving bowl and I heartily endorse it!"
"First of all, the packaging is well done, well protected for shipping. I got this for my son, who knew there must be more to life than shaving cream from a can, but he didn't know what. I selected a shaving soap and then I started researching bowls. This was everything the description promised it would be. It is in itself a handsome piece, but the real beauty of it lies in its ability to hold heat on a chilly winter morning. If you do as the instructions say, fill it with hot water while you are showering so the stone can heat up, you will be rewarded with the most luxurious shave you have ever had. My son is very satisfied, he has found what he didn't know he was looking for. The only reason I gave it four stars for travelling is the weight (it is made of marble, after all), but size-wise it can pack easily among clothes without taking up much room."
"Replaced another bowl that wasn’t the right dimensions for getting a nice lather with my brush. As it happens my hand was just a bit too big and my old bowl was just a bit too deep for proper brush movement.  This bowl feels like it will last a very long time, has a surprising weight about and fits quite nice in the hand. It’s not too deep or too wide. Perfect.  I shave in the shower so word of caution: you would certain not want to drop this thing as it would surely cause some pain if it whacked your foot on the way down...it’s that substantial.  I don’t see how you could wrong if this model interests you."
Works great! The ridges really help lather up shaving cream. The heat retention properties of the bowl adds an amazing feel. Looks very high end.  Like: Looks & feels very high end Spacious bowl Ridges inside bowl work to lather quickly Heat retention works as described Provides a rich warm lather  Dislike: Had a temporary terrible foul smell (had to soak in soapy water for 30 minutes then air dried in direct sunlight to finally get rid of the bad smell). Bowl had sandy residue left all over bowl and inside the packaging. Textured ridges may scratch brushes if not careful.  Neutral: Expensive. May be too large for some.
"I tend to over analyze everything by reading far too many product descriptions and reviews before selecting anything on Amazon and this bowl was no exception. Some of the reviews were helpful but others make me wonder if they really bought the same bowl. I like natural products so part of my choice was this bowl is made of marble. Besides liking how it looks I also knew that unlike a metal bowl, marble would not potentially leave rust stains my counter. I was also influenced by the product description and reviews which mentioned heat retention. I am very pleased with my selection and want to point out areas where I agree and disagree with some of the other reviews: -Yes, it is heavy. You should expect that from natural stone and I didn't buy this as a travel item -If you run hot water on the bowl it will retain heat and you'll get a warm shave. -It is certainly large enough to do the job. -I don't care if there is no rubber bottom to keep it from sliding around during use because I hold it in my hand. -Yes, the groves in the marble seem to help froth up the brush. -No, the groves are not sharp and have not damaged my brush after several uses.  Bottom line, I like it and would buy another one if something happens to it. But considering it is as solid as a rock (literally), I doubt I'll need another. So if you want a solid bowel that will retain heat and look good sitting on your counter, you've found a good option."
This is a great product. I was looking for a new shaving bowl since the stainless steel one I had for only a few month started to rust. Marble! That does not rust. This bowl has a solid feel when you hold it. The look is luxurious. The outside is smooth and feels nice in the hand. The inside is rough and has carved ridges that help whip up a satisfying lather. You can heat the bowl under hot water prior to lathering for a warm foam. It works! A definite buy if you are looking for a top end luxurious shaving bowl. It won’t disappoint.
"Good lord this thing is one magnificent piece of manufacturing. The bowl is well constructed and heavy enough to not move when resting on the bathroom counter. The weight also feels good in your hand when you are mixing your soap and is not uncomfortable to hold.  The textured interior threw me off at first, but I quickly realized that it allows you to generate a better lather in the bowl as opposed to a standard smooth surface. The bowl itself is also well-designed and looks great as a design piece.  Combine all of this at an affordable price and this is more than worth the purchase."
"This shaving bowl surprised me. I was going to buy a double walled stainless bowl, but this one just looked so much nicer. I heat it up under running hot water and it holds the heat almost all the way through a three pass shave with a safety razor. It has little rides on the inside which help to create a nice lather, yet the bowl is easy to clean.  If you're a shaving enthusiast, or just want a nice hot lather, give it a shot. I highly recommend this product."
"With the same shaving cream and with the same razor but with this bowl (instead of another one), the shave experience is dramatically better - producing a better lather and getting a better shave. I cannot imagine getting a better lather -- would likely get a better shave with a different razor. Definitely , the bowl s able to retain water heat and whatever coarseness is there on the inside is perfect for producing a good lather. Even when I have by mistake left too much water on the brush, the lather still comes out a lot better than with the prior bowl. But, now I know how much moistness to leave behind on the brush and I get a perfect lather. Holds my brush comfortably; the size of the bowl is perfect for my brush (I will update with the size of the brush soon). For best results, I fill the bowl with hot (hottest) water. Soak the brush with hot water and leave the brush in the bowl for 15 to 30 minutes. Then squeeze and shake to get most of the water out of the brush. Add Nivea cream to the bowl and generate awesome lather. Looks good, is heavy (but not extremely heavy), fits well in my hand. Could it/should it have been priced lower? I think, yes. But I knew how much I was paying for it and I am totally satisfied. Hence no hesitation in giving it five stars."
"First, I want to put in a caviat about Travel. This is a heavy bowl. I will not take it traveling. I have lighter bowls for travel. It says that it soaks up heat and that is sure does. It is a pleasure shaving with it and always having nice warm lather. I fill a sink with hot water and let it soak. I give it at least two trips to the sink. I have tried a lot of Lather Bowls in my search for the best one. This Marble Bowl ranks #1!"
"Is it on sale right now? If so, buy it. If not, probably still buy it.  Pros: -Looks great -Holds heat if you throw some hot water in it before using -Grooves make lathering quick and easy -...that's it. It's a shaving bowl. Just a really great one.  Cons: -You won't want to travel with this (one of the ""Features"" for rating on here). It's a good size and pretty heavy."
"This is the perfect shaving bowl; exactly what I was hoping it would be. It holds warmth well, has enough roughness inside to ensure excellent lathering, and it is sooooooo handsome. Best to warm the bowl with really hot water inside and out for several minutes to ensure that the stone heats throughly (you can soak your brush at the same time). The stone is porous so it will absorb stronger scents from your soap, so keep that in mind. It adds a timeless aesthetic den vibe... Love it."
"Bought this after trying a few others. While it is not good for traveling, due to its seriously heavy mass, that is always what helps it retain warmth for generating a great lather. The thing won't be going anywhere as you rub your brush along the ridges. The ridges themselves help to make a good lather quickly, and I use them to spread the soap across easily without it sticking to my fingers to make the lather even quicker. Best shaving product that I have ever bought. It seems durable as well, but it has olny been a few months, so only time will tell.  UPDATE: This bowl has held up perfectly for coming on a year now. At this point I won't hesitate to give it a firm recommendation. Nothing has chipped and the ridges have not worn. It retains heat well in addition."
"This is a very substantial shaving bowl. Nice and heavy, beautiful marble. The ridges on the inside create extra friction while whipping up the soap to create an impressive lather. Great heat retention to keep the lather nice and warm."
"I purchased this shaving bowl some weeks ago after looking at comparable products and reading through a lot of reviews. This has exceeded my expectations. To be honest, this was a luxury buy. I had a small ceramic bowl that I previously used, but I felt it was slightly too small. This bowl is beautiful, well-crafted, well-designed, sturdy, and a great size. It's large enough to hold the lather but fits nicely in the palm of your hand. The marble retains heat exceptionally well. I fill it with hot water for a few minutes before use and I'm always impressed by how warm it keeps the lather. The ridges on the inside of the bowl really help to work up a lather with a shaving brush.  I've never actually reviewed a product on Amazon before now, but I am going out of my way because this bowl has really made shaving a joy. 10/10 recommend buying this beautiful bowl."
Don't even bother with another Soap Bowl!  I tried multiple other products that honestly didn't live up to what this product delivers each and every day. Fits great in the palm of my hand. Enough weight to let me know I'm about to have a man's shave. It provides just the right amount of friction to help the soap reach it's ultimate lather. The marble construction is perfect for maintaining the temperature I want..
"Certainly a good lather with this bowl due to the texture in the bowl (which not to mention is solid and heavy). In about 7 clockwise swirls with your brush, you will get a pretty thick lather (mind you, I was using shaving gel rather than soap which in which i would never imagine getting a thick lather)."
"The bowl is absolutely great. It retains heat significantly better than the ceramic lather bowl I have, and it looks amazing. The interior shape of the bowl is perfect for whipping up a larger because the mouth is wider than the foot which is not the case with all bowls unfortunately.  The only downside is the white marble makes it a little harder to see the condition of your lather than a darker bowl would, but this definitely isn't a deal break."
"This bowl is heavy and stays put, not sliding around the vanity. The texture on the inside helps to make an excellent lather. It holds temperature well, so if the room where you shave is cold, you'll want to fill it with hot water and let it sit for a bit before putting the shave soap in (assuming you want a warm lather)."
"This bowl is excellent for keeping heat for a good period of time until the shaving is over, great size fitting in hand, it is a foaming machine! * The image of the bottom is not a crack, it is a vein of alabaster :) happy with it"
"For me, warm shaving cream is a key to success. I drop this beautifully constructed piece of marble in a sink full of hot water before I shower.  When it’s time to shave you have nice warm shaving cream start to finish. I can only imagine this is similar to what ancient Roman sculptures used when they shaved."
"It’s marble, it’s heavy, it holds the heat after using hot water to warm it up before adding/whipping the shaving soap. Perfect size. Looks very nice on the counter. It’ll last a lifetime with care."
"Going from a small stainless steal bowl that came with my brush to this is huge. I do soak it in hot water for 60 seconds as per instructions. The bowl is pretty big compared to my small bowl. So you have to do bigger rotations with the brush, but the heated marble bowl with grooves on the inside. Makes it easy to form shaving cream in half the time. P.S. The only reason I write this review is because, there aren't many reviews out there for this shaving bowl thing."
"I've tried a variety of mugs and bowls and this is my favorite. I can put hot water into it while I shower and it is very warm by the time I'm out of the shower. It will keep lather warm for two passes of the razor,  The bowl has scores on the inside that make whipping up a lather super easy. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. I like it even better than the granite bowl I had been using before this. Definitely a keeper."
"This shaving bowl is amazing, keep it under hot running water for a minute and it will give you a nice and warm foam. The size of the bowl is relatively large so it is very easy to use it with any soap. What I do is I put a soap on the bottom of it and make a foam on top of it. I do not take out the soap until I finish it - so I use it also to keep the soap inside. The disadvantage of this bowl is its weight and durability. It is so heavy that I am worried that it will break my floor if I will drop it accidentally - so it requires your attention while shaving. You can not put it on the edge of the sink just because you are scared about the consequences of it being dropped. Obviously it will crush into pieces if it will fall breaking both itself and the floor. The bottom part of the bowl - the one that is in contact with the shelf is slippery. If you put it on a wet surface it slides on it as on the ice skates. This is definitely not a traveling product. If you have to travel with it make sure to wrap it the same way you would wrap a crystal glass. Besides it I use it every day and very happy with that"
This bowl is large and heavy in a good way. If you take care of this bowl it will last for decades. No joke. My only concern is if it falls from the counter it will either break your foot or tile. The bowl holds the temperature of hot water if you want a hot/warm shave. Just a heads up the store with walls in its name has the same bowl/same seller for $8 cheaper.
"This marble shaving soap bowl is awesome. I was looking for a soap bowl to make a nice lather for my shaving soap and after doing a lot of research of similar products, I believe this is the best purchase for your money if this is in your price point. The bowl generates a nice soap lather for your brush and it holds its heat rather well. I thoroughly enjoy this product and enjoy how well its looks too! Highly recommend this product!"
"The bowl was hefty, which was the big thing for me. I was expecting something thinner that felt like it could break in your hands, instead I feel like I could smash this into the side of a bears head then use it afterwards. The fact it is possibly the classiest thing I now own is a bonus."
"This bowl looks amazing and easy to make good lather. It's a solid marble, easy to heat and make your lather worm. It came well packed and not damaged. I hope it's really made in India and will last for years."
"I just received this Bowl and really like it, so far. I believe a marble bowl holds the heat of the shaving cream much better than a porcelain one that I've used for the past 15 years. I really like the weight. It is a product that is described as it is designed. I would have no problem considering other products they sell."
"The packaging was excellent. I was a little concerned because the bowl is marble. When I opened the box, Wow this bowl is heavy and it's a beauty. I used my silver-tipped badger brush and some Mudder Focker shaving cream. I put hot water into the bowl to heat it up prior to lathering the MF. The results were excellent. This marble bowl is worth the money. Thank you BB."
I originally bought a stainless steel bowl. But my Parker badger brush was so heavy it kept trying to fall over. This marble bowl has some heft to it. I fill it with hot water in the sink while I shower. Then use it to shave after. Very classy.
Very heavy. just what I was looking for. A little larger than I thought but I am very happy with my purchase.
"Builds a great lather no matter the soap; very heavy, though - not really designed for traveling. Better than using some plastic cup or bowl 🥣"
This product keeps shave cream warm. I fill it with water and put in the microwave for 90 seconds and soak my brush in it. Lathers well. I don't know about travel since I have only used it at home. Would purchase again if something happened to it.
Large and heavy. When you warm it up under some hot water for about 40 seconds before you add the shaving cream you get them most wonderful warm foam. The design is perfect for creating a lot of foam. Cleans easily.
I bought this for my fiancé and he absolutely loves it. It’s a very sturdy bowl and heavy. Perfect for on top of a vanity or bathroom counter. It has these cool ridges around it too make a nice lather with a brush. It also looks really expensive and fancy. Just what I was looking for. Beautiful and great product!
"Outside is smooth, inside is rough/textured - works great and looks great. Me like and wifey like. Goodness!"
Pretty bowl to hold water while shaving if you face lather. It's nice to use for bowl lathering too. Holds heat well if you preheat then add hot water.
Easy to clean has small ridges in bowl whips up a great foam for shaving using small amounts. Looks great on my grey counter as well.
"My husband loves this bowl. He says it’s a “game changer.” It’s very heavy, which could be a problem with wet hands, but he hasn’t dropped it yet. Overall, he prefers this over a metal or wood bowl."
It is heavy just don’t drop on your foot or tile but it gets hot when you let hot water run in it the shaving cream lather up so good I am happy with it
Nice heavy bowl. Holds the heat. Some what big for a travel mug and no cover.
A good rustic bowl with just enough grind ridges in the marble to make a good lather. It would be a little large and heavy for traveling
"Fantastic shave bowl, very worth the money, after soaking it in hot water it retains heat very well. I like the weight and the ridges inside do a great job of lathering. My shave bowl for many years to come."
this is a nice bowl and it really works up a lather
"Beautiful white marble, heavy little bowl that fits in the hand and retains the heat. Don't drop it, keep it dry and this stone will serve you a long time."
the bowl is large enough and gets warm really quick. Good agitation for making a great lather. Heavy duty.
"I love my bowl! Keeps my shaving lather warm and is easier to use than a traditional cup. I was afraid that I might not be able to hold it but despite its weight, it fit nicely in my hand."
"It is heavier than I expected and is wider than I expected, so it doesn't fit exactly where I had intended to leave it. Therefore I will probably buy a small shower shelve once I find one not made in China.  However, it does a great job of creating a warm lather with very little Cremo shave cream. I would buy it again.  No rating for travelling because it is not intended for travel use."
"Another minor game changer for my daily shaving routine that upgrades my quality of life. For anyone that uses a shaving brush, this bowl is a must."
"This is a beautiful and practical thing (makes great lather) that will can last 100 lifetimes. I think that most shaving bowls are a rip off, but this one is worth the money."
"Love this soap bowl. It's heavy, solid and beautiful. Good size. Holds heat well for nice hot lather"
This thing is well made. It's real. It's heavy. It's one solid piece. Perfect size and thick walls. My expectations were definitely exceeded.
"I have used this bowl for about 6 months now and I will say it makes a difference. The contours along the inside help to generate a nice lather quickly, and the bowl itself is a nice width. Very nice-looking bowl, as well. Many items look and/or feel cheap when you actually receive them, but not this bowl. Nice weight and texture."
"Does its job well and looks nice on my counter. Lets me whip up a good lather and is easy to wash out clean after. Made of solid Marble, it is heavy, which I consider a good thing. All in all a good product at a reasonable price."
With the textured interior it was very easy to generate a thick lather. It also held the heat well and is very easy to clean. It is a little heavy but given the material it is to be expected so just need to take care when handling. Overall very satisfied with purchase!
"I brought this bowl because I wanted something unique! I’ve used it three times now & it works beautifully, I Soak it in hot water for a couple minutes & put my shaving cream in & it warms up the cream. It’s easy to clear up as well!"
Solidly crafted. Very elegant. Serves it's purpose quite well.
Very nice print on the marble. Heavy construction allows heat retention by running hot water for about 40 seconds. Grooves inside the bowl help build up a great lather that is hot because the bowl retained its heat even after the second lather pass.
Love this bowl. It's as beautiful as it is functional.
I like the looks and feel of the bowl. The ridges inside the bowl help hold the soap in place
I have only used Bigelow cream but I am sure there are others that work well with this bowl. Smooth Marble on the outside but rough on the inside to foam shaving cream. Works great.
Great lathering bowl. Whips it up @ nano speed!
Told my daughter who is 17 that they are unbreakable this girl through this on to ground before I could say not too. Not in a soft fashion full on I am going to prove my father wrong. Did not break or even scuff. Even after chasing her around the house pelting her with it no breaky. I will update after we have tried the bat.
"Site says microwave safe. Wrong. Bowls are disintegrating in the microwave. Clear, small, linear strings are falling off the bowls when used in the microwave."
"We love these bowls. They are so durable! We have four kids (4-13) and these bowls have been dropped, washed, microwaved, used for hot an cold things, and they still look amazing! Definitely recommend."
The bowl started peeling after getting hot.
"The size of these bowls are perfect. Most bowls are pretty small, but these are perfect for soups, chili, and breakfast cereal. I have to hand wash my dishes and these clean up very easily, and are not breakable. I liked them so much I ordered 2 sets."
"It says microwave safe, but this is what happened when I microwaved food for 3min.. it melted!!"
Too small and not safe in microwave You can buy at Walmart for 50 cents and microwave safe
"I am delighted with the quality and size of these environmentally-friendly bowls. They are perfect for cereal - the best bowl I've had in a while that holds my cereal, bananas (or other fruit) & plenty of milk without spilling. They are easy to clean and stack. I highly recommend these bowls. I ordered dishes to match, which I also like ... but I LOVE THESE BOWLS."
"I have used these bowls in my microwave many times and no problem. Since this is September 2021, wonder if they have improved them as many people said they were not microwave safe. Also I will store sauces with a tomato base in them in the freezer. When I go to wash them the coloring from the sauces completely comes off immediately unlike some plastic containers that always retain some of the sauce color. I recommend them highly"
"These are made of ""wheat starch"" and are biodegradable. They were even advertised as having a slight ""pleasant smell"" of wheat which I thought was weird. Someone even asked if they were gluten-free, LOL. Although I thought the idea was strange they have held up well so far after several weeks of washing them in the dishwasher. I imagine that I will get a few good years of use out of them. I bought them for prep bowls because I kept breaking my glass bowls and I was tired of cleaning up the mess. I have limited mobility in my right hand. This was a great solution. They are the right size for both prep and eating, and I like the muted colors."
"These are fantastic with a little bit of extra care. Very light compared to ceramic bowls--which get boiling hot while food is still cold. These don't get hot in the microwave as long as you don't go too long. I've done 2 minutes, stir the food and then another 30 to 60 seconds without issue. If one gets stained I just throw it out. After six months I haven't thrown any out despite putting pasta sauce or other food that stains."
"I make lots of homemade soups, 5 gallons at a time. We then freeze them in 2C containers and microwave them at our leisure. This is our primary use for these. Our past bowls were handled ceramics. They got very hot in the microwave and although they were ""microwave safe"" most of them cracked on us - just thawing and heating soup. These comments are based on this use.  Pros: * Don't heat up in the microwave, so unless your food gets hot enough to melt these, they will be great. * Because of the above, thick soups do not burn to the sides of the bowl while microwaving making cleanup SUPER easy. * They are super light. * They are great heat insulators, I can hold a bowl of soup that is too hot to eat. They get a little warm right where the soup is, but they have a little ridge around the bottom so when the soup is very hot, I can hold the bowl by the ridge and the rim. By the time it is edible, the entire bowl is cool to the touch. * They seem pretty strong. * Inexpensive - always a plus. * Good enough that I already bought 8 more ;-)  Cons: *They look like cheap plastic. Not really a con since you can see what they look like on the picture, but I would love to find some nicely designed bowls made out of this material."
"No, this is not a Megadeth review. This is my bowl review. Bowl is very lightweight and somewhat flexible. while I had my reservations about this bowl when I first received it, it does what I need it to do. That is, warm up my oatmeal or soup here at work. I am a New England clam chowder guy, and you all know how that stuff can cling to and burn a plastic dish, specially when not cooked properly. Anyway, this dish had no problems warming up my soup in the microwave here at work. When used properly in the microwave to warm up soup, it handles that job perfectly."
"After breaking a very large glass plate and cleaning up tiny bits of glass for days afterward, I decided to transition to something other than glass. These bowls fit the bill perfectly. Now, I don't have to worry about broken glass. They are lightweight yet very sturdy. They hold quite a bit of food. They are also easy to clean. I purchased the matching plates to go with them a few days later as I was so pleased with the bowls. Oh, and they arrived super fast. There are matching glasses that you can purchase separately or you can buy the whole set of plates, bowls, and glasses, including table utensils (knives, spoons and forks of the same material), together. I think that you'll like them as much as I do. I'm going to order the matching glasses."
"I was using dollar store ceramic/glassware as my primary food service stuff, themselves an upgrade from paper plates which made every meal seem like a picnic, indoors, with the shades drawn, eating by monitor-light.  Eventually I realized that if I drop these things - AGAIN - it will be a huge pain, so I looked for an alternative to the bowls. I found these, and they seem great. Microwave safe, dishwasher safe, solid and secure enough, easy to clean, and so on.  Decent price too."
"I made an egg in one in the microwave this morning, perfect size for a bagel sandwich. I made crab salad in one for lunch. They're the perfect size for single meals, clean easily and don't heat up in the microwave. They will transfer heat from the cooked item, but the top of the bowl is easily in an acceptable temperature range after cooking."
"OMG sometimes things aren’t what you like when buying from the internet. This is not the case with this company. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I needed outdoor dishes for my Lanai here in Hawaii & the pictures don’t do these products justice. So pleased with all of their products. I ordered the bowls, plates, utensils appetizer plates & the cups. I will be ordering again Love love love these products!! Thanks so much"
"These bowls are great! I've put them through their paces, both in the microwave and dishwasher. They seem as perfect as when I unboxed them. Even oily salad dressing washes out easily, and cheese dip and marinara warmed in the microwave didn't stain them. I'm definitely happy with an eco friendly product that actually does a great job. Considering adding the plates and cups!"
"The bowl is sturdy and durable. I thought it would be some small, baby size bowl, but no its perfect portion controlled size. I could get a good bowl of cereal and milk in here. I'm mad it only comes with 4 for this price of $10, but I guess."
"Sturdy, ridiculous easy to clean (""impossible"" debris wipes right off with an hour soak). Unlike some other reviewers here, I *have* had success with these in the microwave - I've made oatmeal and spaghetti-o's innumerable times where the only problem is that the tomato sauce requires a soak to clean. There's literally nothing bad I can think of about these bowls."
"These bowls are very sturdy. I like these bowls a lot. My daughter cooked ravioli in a bowl in the microwave. It did leave a stain in the bowl originally but after several more uses and trips through the dishwasher I don't see the stain anymore and I don't even know which bowl it was. The bowls are a nice size, lightweight, easy to clean and I would definitely buy again."
""
"I don't know why, but we seem to go through ceramic and glass kitchenware. We were down down t one big cereal bowl and I ordered these. I love them. They have a nice feel to them, not plastic or cheap. I don't have any problem serving them to a guest. They clean easily. Actually, I wish that they were available in a larger size, for mixing and serving."
"These plates and bowls are so easy to clean. We love the plates, my 23 year old grandson who is on the autism spectrum and spills alot with regular plates, use this without spilling because of the big lips the plates have on them. He is very confident in these plate. The bowls for cereal and soup are very deep so less spills. These will not breah"
"I have been eating cereal and soup and other ""wet"" foods out of flat soup bowels all my life. They don't hold much,they spill easy, food gets cold quick. They don't work. I finally ordered these bowels. They are the right size, they don't tip all the time and food stays the right temperature. I love them and would highly recommend them."
"I love these bowls! if you never owned anything like them before, the feel will take a bit to get used to but in the end its worth it. You don't have to worry about them breaking, but yet they are a bit more studier then straight plastic. They wash easily in the dishwasher, big bonus. They are microwave safe, and they even come with a bonus cleaning sponge! I just ordered more to have on hand."
"Have had for 10 months. size and shape perfect. Wonderful for arthritic hands. pleasant colors. Sturdy, look like new after regular use. I have heated food in microwave, but not used for cooking stuff and have not had any melting or material shedding."
"My kid and her friends have a hard time remembering which plates I own are microwavable and which are not. So I decided to replace all the plates, bowls, etc in the house that ate not microwavable with these wheatgrass products. So far, I love them! These bowls have a slick inner surface which makes them easier to clean. Love the colors also. They are light weight, yet seem perfectly sturdy. Top notch product!"
"These are the best bowls I have ever used. I use them for everything. They do pick up a stain from sauce or chili if you microwave them, just like tupperware does, but they are super durable. They smell a little funky out of the box, but after a quick wash they are good to go. The colors arent obnoxious, and they hold quite a lot without feeling obstructively large."
I have not had the problem in the microwave that some people have. I like knowing that these safe for my kids to use. They are not flimsy like most of the plastic bowls we have used in the past and we are not getting led poisoning from ceramic bowls.
"Great for cereal! Bought to replace my husband's favorite cereal bowl! We find these nice a deep, great for cereal or a big bowl if chili! Cleansing well, doesn't stain easily. Holds up in the dishwasher!"
If kids are always breaking your bowls (or your clumsy husband) buy these they are just the right size for a cereal bowl. You can fill half way for kids and your husband can fill it all the way up. These are nice and clean up great in the sink or dishwasher
I bought these bowls to replace some plastic ones I have had for years. I was concerned about size and if they would stand up to using them in my microwave. The size is perfect for my morning cereal and they seem to be fine in the microwave. Only time will tell about the microwave.
These are great bowls. I was looking for something that was light weight and wouldn’t break if dropped. They clean easily and hold a lot. I’m even considering getting another set.
"These are indeed expensive, buuuuut worth it. I tossed all of my kids cheap plastic plates and bowls and replaced them with these because they kept trying to microwave on the thin plastic plates. They have held up great, cleaned well in the dishwasher, and survived the microwave on a few occasions. Highly recommended."
I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these bowls but was pleasantly surprised. They seem sturdy enough and clean and dry off easily. I don't have a dishwasher so they get hand-washed. They don't pass on any funny chemical-like tastes to the food and no odor. An excellent non-plastic alternative solution that won't take centuries to decompose in a landfill!
"Have had these bowls for about a year now and I have no complaints. They are sturdy, dishwasher and microwave safe and do not stain. Great item and I would buy again."
"I like that we can use these in the microwave. They're great for heating up leftovers or soups, also good for cold stuff. After several cycles through the dishwasher they're still holding up nicely with no staining (I enjoy tomato soup!), no cracks or anything else which would indicate poor quality. They're really nice bowls. The colors are nice too."
"I was unsure of what to expect from a bowl made of wheat. But I can confirm that they are durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I haven't tried them in the microwave. They are large and deep, perfect for cereal."
"Purchased these with the intent of using them in our camping trailer. We were looking for light and easy, and plates that would fit into the little sink in our Casita. These work perfectly! They clean easily and are big enough for our meals. Love the fact that they are eventually compostable! Can highly recommend."
"I keep chipping my glass bowls when washing dishes, so I decided to find bowls that won't break instead. These have worked fantastically! At first I thought the box was empty, these were so light. Will definitely purchase again when needed."
Have these for months. I don't use them in the dishwasher even though I read it's not plastic. I do use them in the microwave though. So I don't know lol. But can drop them from a high surface and don't break. Durable and light. Use them for my daughter
"We also have other products by this manufacturer and find all of them sturdy, dishwasher safe, and attractive. I highly recommend them. In fact, I give sets as gifts."
They may be smaller than expected but turned out to be the perfect size for noodles and soup. They are dishwasher and microwave safe which is a big plus. Great for kids since they are sturdy and can take a beating. Love them.
"The perfect bowl. I purchased these because ceramic cereal bowls were scratching my table. These bowls solved that, and more! The shape is perfect for keeping the cereal off the sides, making it easier for kids or challenged adults. These are cute, durable and easy to clean. I’m ordering more!"
"We just got these bowls in. I purchased them because we are hard on bowls and mugs, and I was down to two soup bowls. We already love them. They are lightweight, but they are sturdy, we've dropped one and it just spun around. They went through the microwave and dishwasher fine."
These are nice bowls. They appear to be unbreakable. They are also a bit smaller than I expected from the pictures from the seller.
We use these for our breakfast cereal and for dessert after our evening meal. The weight of these bowls make it easy to use while sitting outside and eating from them.
"good and usefull size ; beating 3 eggs for - - ,a bowl of cereal , waffle batter for 1 . and they don't break if you drop them."
Love these! Bought them because little kids and glass bowls don’t mix. And they are super cute. We all use them and will be getting more. My daughter heated up spaghetti and I thought that was the end of the bowl and it didn’t stain!
"Very nice, lightweight and the best thing is that they don't come out hot from the microwave! They hold just the right amount and are very pretty. The only thing I can't do is let my dog lick the bowl, she will try to eat it - So I guess I can say that the bowl seems ""tasty"" too."
"These bowls are super useful. Light and sturdy, they are used multiple times a day. In fact, they are the only bowls I use now. I liked these so much that I purchased a matching set of plates."
"These bowls are great. I bought them for use in my RV--lightweight, durable and safely microwaveable. I also like that it washes easily even if the food in it was greasy. Colors are very pretty too."
"My husband loves these bowls. They are lightweight, a nice size to hold soup with lots of crackers, and the bowls stay cool enough to hold onto. They can go in the dishwasher too!"
"I love the colors, they are easy to clean and go in the dishwasher, microwave. I bought these for cereal and a set in the same colors just a little larger for salads. I love them both. They are sturdy, easy to hold and easy to use and clean."
I got these for my grandchildren. I wanted something that was Microwave safe and unbreakable. These are perfect! I like them so much I ordered 2 more sets to use as salad bowls for family dinners.
These bowls come in cute colors and are very easy to clean. They are very lightweight which makes them easy to carry by my toddler but unbreakable for when he drops them! They are the perfect size for cereal or oatmeal in the mornings.
"Bought them and same glasses for when I go out of town, staying in hotel or camping. Very lightweight, microwaveable, clean easy and environmentally friendly."
"I purchased these bowls because I did not want to purchase plastic and I wanted something that was very versatile, that could be good for eating cereal, making salads, and heating up food in the microwave. They are also very easy to clean. I am very happy with these bowls"
"These haven't broken, biodegraded in my sink, chipped, discolored, or done anything but be good bowls. I'm a clumsy old person who drops things. These will outlast me. Then they can biodegrade."
I love these. I have sensory issues with people clanking utensils with plates and bowls and this has been a lifesaver from major stress.
"The bowls are very lightweight, can go in the microwave, but they don't get hot! They are also easy to wash whether by hand or in the dishwasher. I may replace all my china, melamie, plastic, etc. with wheatgrass products."
I have used these bowls for 2 years and they have worn well so I ordered another set. I like that they do not get really hot when microwaved. The size is also good for most needs.
These are very nice plastic bowls. The colors are really pretty and they wash well. Perfect size.
No complaints works well in the microwave Worth the money I paid will buy again if I need more bowls
"Love these bowls! I got a set of these for my rv to replace all the plastic and I'm so happy with them, they clean SO well, don't get hot to the touch in the microwave, are light weight and just plain cute. I completely recommend these to anyone!"
"These are the perfect size, deep bowl holds foods better than a regular cereal bowl. Sturdy, unbreakable when dropped. This is my second order. We use often, so 4 were not enough for the two of us! Thank you!"
"These bowls are great! Just the right size for cereal, soup, leftovers etc etc. Very sturdy and easy to clean. They do well in the dishwasher and microwave. Great seller too. Fast and thoughtful."
I love these! Have matching plates. Clean up good and look awesome. Easy to clean💥💥💥👍
"Very nice colors, go with anything, light weight and easy to clean"
"I was not expecting what I got. I thought I was getting some cheap knock off, but when it arrived I realized I was wrong. it is real pottery, beautifully glazed. The edges where the chopsticks go in are slightly thin so use some care when handling. The whole set has inspired me and my son to try to make our own noodles. It is absolutely gorgeous."
"I purchased these after looking through countless sets of ramen bowls without finding exactly what I wanted. This set had all of my requirements...functional but beautiful, (and as an added plus, it comes with spoon and. chopsticks!) The bowls were packaged well and arrived exactly as described. I will be purchasing another set! I would definitely hand wash these to make sure the finish remains."
There was a strong odor when I unboxed this. I could smell it on my hands after touching it. The packaging was Styrofoam. It's 2022 and that is simply archaic and unnecessary.
Beautiful bowls. Not as big as I expected it to be but I guess it’s good for portion control. This set makes me want to eat soup all the time. I love the product and I’m very happy with my purchase.
Beautiful bowls and high quality. Doesn’t fit as much broth as a normal bowl would aesthetically pleasing and easy to clean! Love that I have my own ramen set.
I received these missing a spoon. I contacted the company and they were great to work with. I really enjoy serving with these
"Disappointed.. it’s too small!! This is definitely cannot serve on a bowl, maybe only noodle without soup. look like a Rather than Cereal bowl."
Beauitful my husband loved them and the chopsticks. Was a surprise gift and was perfect.
I got this to make instant ramen while I was overseas. I don't recommend this product for that purpose as there are much thinner at the bottom than I thought they would be. These bowls are amazing though! The quality is that of a rather fancy ramen restaurant and would be perfect for a home environment. Make sure you wash the chopsticks toughly before use.
They were a gift. They were moved by the persons they were given to.
Smaller than I thought but still a good size. The color is very rich looking.
As advertised
Very pretty blue color.
These are so beautiful! The color and design are superb.. can't wait to use them!
Very nice and cute
"It’s ok. I guess, but not what I wanted"

"My wife and I LOVE ramen, so much so that we've been experimenting with making it at home. It's not enough to simply eat ramen, you need the right swagger for it too! That's why we got these ramen bowls, as they make us official ramen-fans now.  This set comes with two ramen bowls, two spoons for the broth, and two pairs of chopsticks for handling the solids. This set looks awesome, they've got that aged/distress look to them. The chopsticks are really high quality too and have held up well after being used and washed quite a few times. I can also confirm that this set is dishwasher safe, as we've washed ours quite a few times without any issues.  I highly suggest this ramen set! It'll make for the perfect gift to any ramen enthusiast couple that you know as well."
I got this bowl set to surprise my wife who loves to cook ramen for us on colder days. The bowls are REALLY nice and high quality. She loves the look of them and also mentioned how high quality they are. They look like they are from a high end store like the Pottery Barn.  The only downside of these bowls is they are way too small for Ramen with a lot of veggies and toppings. We grow Baby Bok Choy in the garden and you might be able to fit 2 heads in there with the Ramen and little room to spare.  Its not a huge deal to us just because we love to eat ramen with an assortment of different ingredients. We will have no problem going back for a second serving!  Overall these bowls are still an amazing addition to our kitchen and I recommend these to anyone needing a smaller scale ramen bowl.
"First of all, the porcelain on these bowls and spoons is very nice. Beautiful blues, deep hues...it’s a very strikingly beautiful set.  The bowl itself is nice and deep. I do wish it was a tad bit bigger. The chopstick holes at the top limit how much you can fill the bowls. 20 ounces may seem like a lot, but it would have been better with a 24 or 30 ounce capacity. That being said, I still love the bowl and the spoon. The spoon is a ‘Chinese’ soup spoon with a shallow enough bowl to easily empty but large enough to spoon ramen noodles, soup and other items.  When I received my package, one of my soup spoons had snapped in two. I contacted the seller, and they offered to either refund some money or replace the spoon. I opted for a replacement. They shipped it right away (from China), and while it took a couple of weeks to receive, it was very nice of them to do this. They actually gave me a set of two spoons as a replacement, so now I have a spare.  I love the set, and I love the service. Five stars!"
"I love these soup bowls - they are well designed to hold chopsticks, but you can easily use them with an American style spoon or the provided Asian spoon. They are nice and deep with holds the heat better than a wide soup bowl.  I've been trying my hand at making Asian style soups and it is nice to be able to serve it in these attractive bowls. These also make wonderful and affordable gifts. It's also worth mentioning that these arrived safely in well designed packaging."
"Wow!..😳😳😳 I'm actually very impressed and surprised at the quality of these in the best way. They are heavier than I expected, the included spoons and chopsticks are quality materials and it came packaged and wrapped with care so nothing broke or chipped. The inside of the bowl is deep and perfect for filling up with your favorite pho, ramen, or soup with wiggle room so you don't spill.  The slot for your chopsticks to sit in make it versatile for more than just soup, things like Phad Thai or virtually any Asian dishes would be a fun presentation with the special chopstick slot. If you are a lover of ramen or really any soup these are perfect, or as a gift for your soup lover. Update: I love these so much , I ended up getting both colors and the cream colored ones are just as beautiful as the blue ones !"
"Everything included here looks very nice. The pictures in the product ad represent this item well. Manufacturing quality and overall ""fit and finish"" are very good. I found no defects in the glaze on the ceramic items.  This set would make a nice gift. The packaging protects everything very nicely for transport, but is very ""utilitarian"" -- a Styrofoam cube and some bubble wrap."
"I loved the idea of this bowl. I bought these and a similar design (different manufacture) in white. They're just too darn small for what it claims its purpose is. It doesn't not hold the stated liquid amount. If you fill it with that much water it will leaks out the small chopstick holes. If you make your own ramen (unlikely) then you can proportion your noodles to broth.  However, If you use a standard ramen pack and add hot water (probably at least 90% of people considering this bowl), you WON'T have enough room for that. If that's what you want get a bigger version of this (30oz or more). If you want a soup bowl, or a bowl to put your take-out pho into, this will be a tight fit but doable. The chopstick rest in nice. Just keep your ramen away from it.  You had one job. Be a ramen bowl for the average ramen eater (prepackaged stuff), and you can't quite do that for how the product is normally eaten."
"What a beautiful ramen bowl I said when I first unboxed it- it was a legit ramen bowl, stylish, big enough, made of porcelain and it comes with chopsticks and spoon as well, perfect for date nights!  The only thing that I don’t like about it was the packaging, considering it was earth month, it was wrap with thick styrofoam that is firmly intact with the bowl, so it’s a little fragile moment when unboxing. While I got it for safely shipping, they should or could have use a more eco approach packaging considering this porcelain ramen set looks hand made, it will for sure up the overall level of the product aesthetics.  Will I still recommend it, of course 10/10! This ramen bowl set for sure will elevate my ramen date nights with my wife- a more authentic experience!"
"I had high expectations when I ordered these-- the bowls look stunning in the manufacturer photos. They did NOT disappoint; they're beautiful dishes that are beautifully glazed. I am really impressed with these. My husband make ramen fairly often (his own dashi, too).  The spoons are gorgeous too. The bowls and spoons are thick and durable stoneware, not thin. Obviously they can break, since they're made of clay, but they are high quality with a thick durable glaze so, unless you drop them, they can withstand normal use. Really beautiful dishes. Recommended. I have the matching sushi plates, too. Although we don't eat sushi a lot at home, we're getting a lot of use out of all the dishes. They're gorgeous and a pleasure to serve with."
These are so awesome! I love that each bowl came with a soup spoon and chopsticks. The chopsticks are wooden and the bowls appear to be ceramic. They are large enough for a big portion and I like that. They clean well. I hand wash them.
"They're a lot bigger than I expected. They each come with their own set of chopsticks and a spoon. Kind of a gritty/rough texture. We've been using them for a few weeks and love them for ramen and Thai soup. One thing I wanted to give the packing unit praise for is their packaging. I brought the box upstairs before I opened it. I stood at the top of the stairs and went to cut it open and dropped it. There's so much styrofoam inside it, the box bounced down 5 stairs then around the corner to another 5 stairs. I thought okay, rest in peace ramen bowls. But they weren't damaged at all! Ha. If they made mirrors I'd definitely buy one."
"My daughters are constantly eating ramen. They generally use the store-bought stuff, but then dress it up a little. Regular soup bowls had a hard time fitting everything, so I got these.  They come very well packed and in perfect condition. The set is a really beautiful shade of blue with nice details. I like how the spoons are designed to lay flat on the table, and the very pointy chopsticks are designed to rest in the loops of the bowls. It's all clever and elegant. I wish they were just a bit larger, but they seem to be sufficient for my kid's ramen, even when they add things like eggs."
"These bowls are perfect for any noodle dinner, in my case I use Pho noodles. They are deep and the handles allowed you to move the bowls from the kitchen to the dining room without having use oven mitts. The color is a beautiful blue. They were easy to wash and dry."
"Looks wise, they're great. They also are dishwasher and microwave safe, which is required in my kitchen (really don't like to have anything that can't just be thrown in the dishwasher at the end of the day). They're a little smaller than I imagined and you're limited in how high you can fill them by the holes for the chopsticks. I honestly would have preferred them without the holes. I also think the spoons, while aesthetically pleasing, aren't super functional. They do not hold a lot of liquid and I usually end up using the other Asian style spoons I have."
"This bowls set is heavy! It does give you a solid feel because of the weight. I do love that it comes with a chopsticks and spoon. A great set for ramen noodles. My kids and I had been fighting to use it. We ended up setting a schedule so no more fighting.  A down side is the bottom on the spoons. It is on the rough side and it creates high pitch noise when not careful. We all take time to get adopt our way to use and not making noise.  Other than that, it is a great set bowl set that our family fights to use."
"Chop sticks are made well, easy to clean and use. Bowls are taller than I expected which is nice. Good quality set, no complaints."
Love these bowls. They are heavy and high quality. Love the built in chopstick holder. Perfect size for a single serving of ramen
"These are not your everyday soup bowls. They are meant for special occasions because they are ceramic and can break easily. Plus, they only came with two in the package so that makes it great for a special occasion with a special friend. It’s good to have a spare set of chopsticks, and I might get more use of these than I will out of the bowls. The bowls are a bit top-heavy with a small bottom, and I worry that they will tip over easily. Overall, though, these bowls are a distinctive addition to my kitchenware."
"I love that these bowls came with spoons and chopsticks. They have that rough pebble/ gravel stoneware texture so if you want smooth bowls, these (at least this blue color) are not what you want.  I honestly expected them to be larger than they are but that's no problem, they'd still hold a decent sized bowl of Ramen.  The $25 price is a bit steep for two bowls, spoons, and sets of chopsticks. I saw that a different color costs even more. The set makes a nice couples gift though."
"I love these bowls. They look really great, they are large, and well made. I do not use chop sticks ever so I could do without the holes on the sides at the top but they don't get in the way."
"My husband loves the Japanese culture. These bowls are the perfect addition to his Japanese styled items. They are made of a durable ceramic. They have beautiful coloring, and the chopsticks are made of a good quality wood. Everything is dishwasher safe, and easy to clean. They are a little small, as my husband likes to cook two packs at a time. Both packs fit in the bowl, but the liquid is very close to the rim. These are the perfect ramen noodle bowls!"
Game changing for eating ramen. I love them! It came with chopsticks and a spoon. Very great quality glass and the two top holes are great for carrying a hot bowl but not burning your fingers.
"The uniidea ceramic bowls and spoons were carefully packed and arrived without damage. The bowls, spoons, and chopsticks are beautifully designed but the 20oz bowl is not large enough to fit one pack of ramen, which was my reason for getting them. I had to forgo some of the soup because if you overfill the bowls, liquid will spill from the chopstick holes. Great concept, but maybe a larger size would work better."
"Everything about these bowls is smaller than it appears online, so keep that in mind when ordering. That said, they are well-made and the size is sufficient for a standard cup of ramen. The conical shape looks rather unique on the table. I thought the spoons were just adorable, and it's nice to have a couple of pairs of reusable chopsticks. I would love to get a similar set with wider rounder bowls."
"I eat a lot of ramen as takeout and am about to start making my own at home, so I picked up these nice looking ohgigatadon style ramen bowels. The ceramic is really solid, they were easy to clean, and I enjoyed the little chopstick holders. Speaking of, the bowels also included some really nice reusable chop sticks. My only complaint is that the bowls are too small. I got standard sized Ramen from two different local take-out places, and from both places the bowls would not fit all of the noodles, toppings, and broth. Most Ramen shops that I go to have about 34oz bowls, and these bowls only hold a max of 20 oz. So that might mean going back for seconds, if you're planning to use these bowls. Still, they are very nice looking and of good quality, so I do not regret picking them up."
"Ordered this for our daughter since she love eating ramen, udon or any noodles. This came perfectly packaged. It is nicely made and the set is perfect for daily use. We make sukiyaki once in a while and with this bowl set, it is enjoyable as it is like eating in a korean or japanese restaurants. They are easy to clean too, and hopefully it will last. Very nice set!"
"It’s true these Ramen bowls are beautiful. The colors are deep , flowing between light and dark blues. The shape of the bowl is perfect for ramen. What makes the bowl though is the two little handles on the top of the bowl. These handles let you move your scalding bowl of ramen easily without having to touch the hot part of the bowl. These bowls get a big thumbs up from our son and I. The bowls come with nice wooden chopsticks and soup spoons that match the bowl."
"Perfect. Size for Raman. Or noodles. Large and roomy . Shades of blue a porcelain that shines. Easy to carry. With rounded hoops, all though they, may be to hold the chop sticks that come with this. They also have two Asian porcelain spoons, this suits me. All thumbs when it comes to chopsticks. I wear noodles when I try.  Beside being large they also have a nice heavy base.  Functional as well as pretty. . Can recommend"
I didn't expect these to be so amazing. I was truly impressed when I saw them out of the box. You can tell these are high quality aside from the price.
"I like my sets to match, these bowls were irregular. One bowl had light blue speckles in it and the other had none. I'm unsure of which is the correct design. The bowls are small and do not hold much liquid because of the chopstick holes. I do,on the other hand, like the color and texture of them."
"We love to eat different ramens and soups, and this bowl set is very handy. It allows you to keep your chop sticks handy and clean.  They are dishwasher safe, though I find it just as easy to quickly handwash. You can also reheat or cook with them in the microwave.  The set comes with two sets of bowls, chop sticks and soup spoons."
Really nice bull set love that you can hold the chopsticks through the holes on the top. Really love the design and the spoons. It’s very good quality bowls. Definitely worth the value. Highly recommend.
Beautiful bowls. Traditional look. Ex clement for a bowl of noodles or any bowl appropriate cuisine. Nice chopsticks also with a way to look them onto the bowls. Nice.
Meets expectations
Very well made
Good value and good quality
Love these for my kids— and simple things like dipping sauce or dipping Oreos in milk :)
Great buy! You can drop them all you want but they won’t break.
Bowls are really small!
"These measure 1 cup exactly. I used these with a diet app that counts calories by food and I set up my menus into 1 cup portions. Since it is a cup size. I use them as a cup of tea or coffee. If it's to hot to handle, I nest a second cup."
Perfect for an 8oz cup of soup. We use these cups in our restaurant and they hold up well to daily use. I would recommend.
So my fiancé ordered these thinking they were going to be big bowls (cereal or noodle bowls) he clearly didn’t read the oz so now i use them to prepare my seasonings for when i cook best thing ever
Perfect size bowls for making your own sauces/ dips for vegetables
"Perfect size, bright color"
The only thing is they are very small
Perfect size and exactly what I was looking for
Perfect size for what I needed
I love the size of these bowls. Highly recommend!
Heated food has a strange taste
Very small bowls
These are perfect to help with mise en place during cooking/baking. They are also the perfect size of a small amount of ice cream because I am terrible at portion control when it comes to ice cream. They are dishwasher safe which is wonderful!
"These were smaller than I expected but we've ended up using them even more than I ever though we would. They're perfect for dips, little bowls of snacks and a million other uses. They wash well on the top rack of the dishwasher too. They stack nicely and don't take up much room in the cabinet. Love them!"
"These are great for sauces like sweet and sour for dipping egg rolls, ketchup for dipping fries, etc. They aren't large but they are unbreakable so they are especially handy for meals on the deck.  It would be good if they had a photo of the bowls next to something so its' more easily understood what the ounces are as far as size relation but it's still a good deal for bowls we will use a lot even though they cannot be used for cereal or soup as expected."
"I got these and the size for $12 is NOT worth it. I received them in a small box thinking they were placed side ways for shipping but no. These were six small cup size bowls, not even big enough for a scoop of ice cream they were smaller than the palm of my hand"
Great size! So useful I ordered a second set of these 8 oz bowls.
I love these bowls for snacks so much that I might get a second set. These are the perfect size and easy to clean and are sturdy good solid bowls.
"Great for sauce,dips, relishes, pickles , various taco fixings etx"
These are so cute and the perfect size. I put a lemon in one bowl for reference- definitely a good sized soup/snack bowl and a really nice color for a plastic bowl. I needed to replace some other bowls that were broken and these are a great addition!
I wanted a bowl set for microwaving leftovers and soups. These work very well for that purpose. I don’t know yet how well they will hold up over time since I have only had them a couple of months but I have seen no negatives so far.
Perfect size for cereal or a meal. Doesn’t stain from red sauces. Great in dishwasher and microwave
These are great. Wonderful easy to clean. Dishwasher approve. No issues. Love the colors and the large capacity that they hold. Nice and sturdy in your hand. Definitely would buy again. Thinking about more.
I love these bowls. They are sturdy easy to clean and perfect size. Will purchase more in future.
My kids love them. Easy to clean & the won’t break!!
"This is the perfect cereal bowl for kids. We didn't want to worry about kids dropping/breaking the bowls so we opted for these and they work perfectly. They are sturdy, not that weird cheap plastic. Perfect size/depth. We also ended up using them for side salads. They are convenient and easy to clean."
"I really love these bowls. Super-light, which is important to me, as I have poor grip and drop things. Hopefully these won't break if I do drop them. Held up well in the dishwasher and microwave, so far. Perfect size for cereal, pasta, salad, dnd they wash off well. If these withstand the microwave and dishwasher use in the long term - I'm buying a lot more!"
Nothing to dislike great product have even dropped one or two and no damage....
These are great for the microwave. I no longer burn my hands when removing them. They are easy to clean and are holding up great.
Cheap price works great no scratching metal sound from a kid using it lol
"What a nice change from basic plastic! They are a great size, sturdy and nice colors!"
Love these bowls. This is the second set I have gotten. They are easy to clean even when using pasta sauce.
Caution looks bigger than they really are
A good size bowl.
These are great. We use them every day
It was so hard to find out the dimensions of these cereal bowls. fyi - they are regular cereal bowl sz. Smaller than I had hoped but good otherwise.
Bought them to go with my colorful dishes (in front). Expected all 4 colors. Instead I got 12 washed out orange bowls. Satisfactory for kids cereal but nothing else. Not wasting the time to send them back.
Good bowls but not for spaghetti it will stain
The color adheres to the bowl after use. It doesn't feel very hygienic.
"Perfect size, super durable, microwaveable and dishwasher safe."
"Beautiful bright colours, the bowl are lightweight, microwave and dishwasher safe and hold a decent amount of food, perfect for cereal and pasta too. There were only a couple of odd marks in two of them but barely noticeable. Great value for the price!!!"
"Awesome bowl set. Very durable, so easy to clean. I love the bamboo eco look to them too! Had them for months now and they still are like brand new. The material never stained and kept its shape. Will definitely buy again!"
"I am prone to breaking bowls so these are perfect for me, they are sturdy, easy to clean and a lot more fits inside than I originally thought, plus the colours are nice"
"Sirven perfecto para cereal o incluso sopa, se puede meter al microondas sin problema. No lo recomiendo para palomitas porque considero quedan muy chicos"
"Cumple con lo que dice, no se manchan, muy resistentes"
"Muy buenos y bonitos, sobre todo para los niños."
Nunca llegaron!! Y pedi 2 sets...
These are great bowls but chip VERY easily if you bang the rim even once. Not near thick enough around the edge. However if used carefully then they are ok. I don’t consider them “commercial” grade at all but I still like the size.
We loved these white bowls so much we ended up getting two more sets. They go perfectly with my plates. We had to get rid of my other bowls because they would not fit efficiently in the dishwasher but these are perfect. They are sleek enough to look polished but have nice rouneded edges that feel good and are not prone to chipping. They are a nice clean white color with a good shine.
Bowls seem study and are a decent size for dinner proposes but there are imperfections like odd bumps all over some of them that aren't on other. Not sure if I got a got a bad bunch but there are seem to be a couple bowls that weren't completely coated correctly and have holes in the white Porcelain as well as the bumps on the bottom/rim of the bowl. Hopefully it is still safe to use and microwave those that aren't 100% coated.
"Love this every day set of bowls; sturdy, easy to clean and they look great! It was easy to find a match for the set of dishes purchased through Amazon a year ago—-I think my college kids stole my bowls that came with the original set!"
"The shape of the bowls make it perfect for eating cereal, soup or any food requiring a spoon. The bowls fit well in dishwasher also."
"I ordered the AmazonCommercial 9-inch Dinner Plate Set, 7-inch Dessert Plate Set, and the 7-inch Salad Bowl Set so that I would have a matching set of dishes to replace my old everyday dishes. All of these dish sets are finished in a plain white pattern, which I prefer for everyday use over decorative patterns because of their clean look. All of the sets match each other perfectly. The quality of each piece is acceptable. There are some dimples in the finish, but they are generally not noticeable unless you look. The porcelain coating is good, and each piece is consistently manufactured. I like that these dishes are oven, microwave, and freezer safe. They are able to withstand temperatures well in excess of any that my oven could reach. The listing recommends hand-washing, but I will not be doing that with them. If these dishes can withstand 1380 degrees, I think that they can withstand my dishwasher."
"I got these bowls to add to a set of white dishes I had, because we use bowls a lot. I needed something plain, well-made and microwave safe. I was not disappointed.  These bowls are all uniform in size, color and finish. The glaze is even and smooth—no visible crackling, bubbles or other defects.  The shape is practical. With the ridge on the bottom, you can stack them when they are wet, and they will finish drying. They don’t stick together with a vacuum seal, either. The lip around the edge is substantial, but not so thick that soup or milk dribble down my chin when I slurp out the last little bit of yumminess.  I have taken them from the refrigerator to the microwave with no issues. They do get a bit warm when I nuke them, but not terrible.  Overall, I’m quite happy with these bowls. I think they’d be practical in not only a commercial setting, but also in an Air BNB or home kitchen. The price is decent, too—almost $18 retail for the set ($3/bowl), on sale at $15 at the time of this review. If you’re looking for something simple, sleek and sturdy, look no further."
"Which is exactly what I was after. I've been using these as everything from cereal to serving bowls. They are sturdy bowls, hold a good bit, easy to wash, and I don't have any complaints so far and I've been using them about three months now, daily use. I've used these to hold/serve food like taco fixings, salad bar set ups, chili sides, dips, sauces, etc. and also as regular bowls to eat from. These look good and work great for all of that. I prefer the white bowls since I can use them as a casual place setting, or I can dress it up during the holidays and not have to worry about what matches, since they're white and go with everything. These are really great bowls though, I'm pretty impressed with some of Amazons kitchen items."
"This is a basic, no-nonsense, reliable set of bowls - AmazonCommercial Salad Bowls - Set of 6 - White. They have a 7” diameter at the top which narrows down to about 4” at the bottom of the bowl. I rely on these for my morning cereal, snacks, ice cream, small salads, and to zap leftovers. They are a standard size, and are white. The porcelain gives a tiny bit of a gray tint, but it’s not noticeable unless you are looking for it. They are a good match with Amazon Basic’s white dinner plates. The product description boasts these will endure 1380 degree temps, the microwave and the freezer, yet recommend washing by hand. I’m guessing the washing by hand is to prevent chips, but they survived the bottom rack of my dishwasher just fine. I have included pics of this bowl lined up with my other bowls to give a visual comparison."
"These are very simple, white-with-a-slight-gray-cast bowls with an attractive shape and elegant rims. They are neither clunky nor fragile. The glazing on all six bowls I received was free from any defects, and there were no chips or cracks. The unglazed bottom edge did have a few very small rough areas, so you would want to be careful when placing this on delicate surfaces, as it may scratch. The product information states that hand-washing is recommended. I am all kinds of confused by this, especially since this is a commercial product and made to withstand very high temperatures, microwaves, ovens, and the like. I cannot imagine a restaurant or any commercial setting that would be willing to hand-wash this, and I will definitely be putting mine in the dishwasher. Perhaps this was an unfortunate typo?"
"A bowl is a bowl, and for that, these are just fine. But they're certainly not pretty. Each bowl has a grayish tint to it (some more than others, as you can see from my photo) and one has a chip in the center. They were packaged extremely well (almost too well), so this defect almost certainly came about during manufacturing.  Also, although I was planning to wash them before their first use anyway, I was surprised by just how dirty they really were -- like actual dirt and grit covering each bowl, plus one of them had a streak of some sort of mystery oil/adhesive that was difficult to scrub off. It did come off, but jeez.  So, these bowls are fine, perfectly functional for everyday use, but I certainly wouldn't put them out if company was coming over."
"A nice clean bright white. Plenty sturdy.  I took these to work, at a residential rescue. At any given time we have around 130 residents plus we have open meals to lots more. These dishes are getting a workout and holding up very well.  They're on the weighty side but not overly so. To my mind that makes them sturdier.  Great size and I like the clean simple look.  Working very well for us.

"These Amazon Commercial salad bowls stack very neatly, which I really appreciate as it’s one of my biggest pet peeves when they don’t! They are a nice size, bigger than a normal bowl with more of a wide rim. Which makes them great for salads or even pasta.  Washing is easy, just throw them in the dishwasher. I haven’t had any issues with chipping or breaking at all, and we’re generally rough on dinnerware in this house! These are very basic with no distinguishing characteristics, which is to be expected since there a commercial line. Overall These seam to be decent quality at an affordable price point!"
"Well what can we say? We needed new dishes so I got the ""AmazonCommercial 6-Piece White Salad Bowl Set, 7 inch, Set of 6 (7 inch, Salad Bowl, Round)AmazonCommercial 6-Piece White Salad Bowl Set, 7 inch, Set of 6 (7 inch, Salad Bowl, Round)"" to use. They work great. They are not too heavy but not too light. They do not chip very easily and they clean up well in the dishwasher. Overall for the value of money, these are a great choice."
"AmazonCommercial 6-Piece White Salad Bowl Set is made of sturdy microwave and freezer safe porcelain. These are heavy duty bowls and each weighs 12.2 ounces.  The bowls are stackable with a top diameter of 7 inches. They are 2.1 inches high and a good choice for salads but also for cereals, snacks, etc.  AmazonCommercial White Salad Bowl have a smooth even finish and seem very durable. They are attractive and versatile bowls."
"These are nice, simple, clean and functional. There were a few divets here and there in the glaze but nothing really significant. They hold up well to regular daily use even in a busy family so I imagine for commercial use they'd do just fine as well. The 7 inch bowl size is ideal for pasta or bigger salads. We love it for making fancy ice cream sundaes where there's a lot of extras to layer on!"
"I love plain white dishes. Flexible use. They fit for every occasion. These are a great size for a standard bowl of soup, cereal, snack, whatever you like. I didn’t notice until after ordering that the product description includes the suggestion to hand wash. That won’t happen here, and I can’t imagine it would happen at very many commercial use places either. So I’m wondering how long these will hold up. Only time will tell."
"We needed more bowls for our son who eats a lot of cereal each day. The little kid plastic type were just too small. The dollar store porcelain were also too small and pretty delicate/breakable. These are perfect. And they work well with our other dishes, which are mostly blue and white. These are great if you are looking for a basic bowl that is durable and microwave (even oven!) safe."
"These bowls are similar to Corelle in shape but have a sturdier, ""fancier"" look. Will update if the bowls chip. Potential chipping is the downside of doing something other than Corelle. We've been putting these in the dishwasher with no issues so far though. These bowls are in the morning rotation, and everyone has been pleased with them so far."
"I ordered this AmazonCommercial 6-Piece White Salad Bowl Set to replace the broken bowls from my dinnerware set. And these bowls are just perfect for that. These bowls are also well-made, and the neat design allows them to be mixed with other plates. I like that these are salad bowls, but these can be used to have cereal, or soup every day."
"Simple little white bowls that do the job for cereal, soup, or whatever else you need to put in them.  They're certainly not going to win awards for their beauty, but they work. I've washed them in the dishwasher with no issues. Also, they've not chipped or broken yet. But yeah, they're white and they're bowls. Need 'em? Get 'em."
My adult son is enjoying these very practical and functional dishes. He has two young sons and didn’t want dishes he had to be really careful with. These are holding up fine and dandy. Basic white and aren’t chipping or etching like some cheap dishes.
These plain white bowls are sturdy and serviceable. They work as well holding cereal for breakfast as they do with salad for lunch and dessert at dinner. The white looks clean and blends nicely with other dish ware. Easy care they are dishwasher safe. Nice.
These look like a cafeteria bowl. They have a thick lip around the entire rim and are heavy and clunky. They are sort of a dirty white color I think they are really ugly and would never use them for a special occasion
I used this bowl for my pasta dish and it held a nice amount. Warmed up in the microwave and it didn’t crack either. Easy to clean and stack away without taking up a lot of space which is great!
"Everything arrived unbroken, which I'm super grateful for. Quality is pretty good, but definitely best for restaurant usage."
"You can't miss with white bowls they go with everything. We like the wide top of these. Look good, sturdy."
"These bowls are great. Nice quality, clean, and looks great. Perfect to fit with any existing set."
"right size, right weight and feel well."
Pure white and easy to clean. Very sturdy!
I wasn’t sure about the brand but I took a chance and I’m so glad that I did. This are great quality and very elegant. I love eating in then and look looking at and holding them. They’re beautiful.
Géniale ces assiettes pour une bonne salade composée !!!
I have the round 7 inch salad bowls which are very similar to a large cereal bowl or dessert bowl. I like that you can choose to mix and match sizes and shapes to suit your preferred shapes and sizes for plates.  The porcelain is reasonably hard wearing everyday crockery and can be microwaved and put in the dishwasher. The white goes with anything and replacements can easily be obtained. The style is plain yet modern and is perfect for everyday use.
"These are great bowls, very simple but nice and thick and a good size.  The bowls look a bit shallow but they are actually able to hold a considerable amount of food.  They're extremely versatile and can be used for many purposes. I use these for salads, soup, small portions of pasta, and desserts."
"Personally I buy all my dishes white, I think they go very well with everything and if you change the design of your home white dishes will always go with everything . These salad bowls are great 👍. Thick and have some weight to it. Seem solid and will be fine in a dishwasher . Great for serving salads or sides and tapas. They have very versatile field of uses. I would buy again and I would recommend 👌"
"Nice set of bowls for generic use, have been used heavily and have stood up to being dropped from a small height, boiling hot water and washing in a sink and via the dishwasher.  Simple white design for a simple and effective job which they do brilliantly - recommended."
"Un prodotto davvero di qualità, già a partire dal confezionamento sì nota quanta cura e attenzione verso il prodotto, ma d'altronde stiamo parlando del marchio Amazon commercial, principalmente destinato al settore professionale, ma che nulla vieta di usarli in casa, anzi.  È una linea di ciotoline considerata da insalata, piccola e compatta, ma non troppo, misurano infatti 18 cm di diametro con un'altezza di 5,5 cm, perfette dunque per molti altri usi oltre quello indicato. Personalmente ci faccio colazione, con yogurt e cereali e pezzi di banana, le dimensioni sono perfette. Si possono usare anche come ciotole per aperitivi, in quanto le loro dimensioni non eccessive permetto di contenere mozzarelline, patatine, salatini e stuzzicherie varie senza essere ingombranti a tavola. Ma sono ottime anche per contenere macedonia, o diventare coppe gelato, insomma si possono sfruttare davvero in mille modi.  Solo eleganti e minimali, bianche e si adattano principalmente ad uno stile sobrio e moderno, hanno una semplice scritta sul fondo con il marchio Amazon commercial.  La loro robustezza e la resistenza ad alte temperature ci permette anche di usarle in forno per la preparazione ad esempio di fondute.  Hanno il bordo arrotondato e ciò permette anche di essere usate per berci il latte, anche se preferisco le classiche tazze.  Cosa non da poco sono anche impilabili, quindi occupano davvero poco spazio.  ⭐ Conclusioni Il set da 6 ciotole mi è piaciuto molto, già dal suo imballaggio. Versatili e dai mille usi dalla colazione all'aperitivo passando per il forno, un prodotto davvero di qualità ad un prezzo abbastanza concorrenziale. Fateci un pensierino perché ne vale la pena.  Spero di esserti stato utile. Grazie ;-)"
"carinissime ciotoline per insalata di AmazonCommercial. SI tratta di ciotole in porcellana bianca, semplicissime, dalle linee pulite che si adattano sia ad una tavola classica che moderna. Arrivano a casa molto ben imballate. All'interno della confezione si trovano 6 ciotole in porcellana di ottima qualità, in grado di resistere ad altissime temperature, fino a 1300°C per cui le posso usare anche come tegliette per il forno tradizionale o per il forno a microonde. Ogni ciotola ha un diametro di 18 cm e un'altezza di 5,5 cm. Sono perfette per delle porzioni singole di insalata, ma anche per portare a tavola della frutta, mozzarelle, olive e via dicendo. Io le uso anche per il latte e i cereali a colazione. Diciamo che si prestano a mille usi e sono comodissime, sono quei pezzi che servono sempre in cucina e che diventano indispensabili. E poi sono perfettamente impilabili quindi occupano pochissimo spazio. La qualità è buona, le misure sono perfette, ne troppo grandi, ne troppo piccole, e sono anche belle per cui le consiglio serenamente sono un ottimo prodotto."
"Prodotto da uso quotidiano, non certo porcellana di pregio, costano poco più di 3 euro a pezzo, sono semplici e ben fatte, relativamente leggere, forse lo spessore è piuttosto basso, comunque adeguato all'uso e a quel che costano.  Il diametro superiore è di circa 18 cm, l'altezza è di circa 5.5 cm e la base di appoggio ha diametro di 8.5 cm; sono prodotte in Cina ed importate dall'Inghilterra, arrivano perfettamente imballate.  Sono esattamente come le vedete nelle immagini online, bianche e lisce, nessuna decorazione o disegno, massima semplicità, magari non proprio per le grandi occasioni."
"Ce lot de 6 bols blancs à salade, en forme de coupe, sont classiques et intemporels. De ce fait ce on peut facilement les associer à un service de style différent et créer un joli ensemble pour dresser une table. Pour une utilisation quotidienne, de par leur moyenne taille, il est possible de s'en servir pour les entrées ou les desserts et les poke bowl tendances actuellement. Ils sont empilables et prennent un minimum de place dans un petit placard, ce qui est pratique. Ces bols à salade sont en porcelaine sans plomb, de qualité. Je suis très satisfaite de ce produit et le recommande."
"Für den schnellen Leser: Ich bin mit den wirklich zufrieden. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Und für alle, die‘s ganz genau wissen wollen:  Die Schüsseln haben ein schlichtes, unauffälliges Design und passen prima zu meinem vorhandenen Set von Villeroy und Boch (dem die kleinen Schüsseln fehlen). Sie haben einen sauberen, reinweißen Farbton. Unter den Schüsseln ist der Aufdruck „Amazon Commercial“ zu finden – meiner Meinung nach hätte man sich den sparen können.  Die Schüsseln haben einen oberen Durchmesser von 18 cm. Der Boden der Schüssel hat ca. 8 cm Durchmesser. Die Schüsseln sind 5,5 cm hoch, eine Schüssel wiegt 358 g.  Macht man eine Schüssel randvoll, gehen 0,62 Liter hinein. Bei normaler Füllung geht also bequem ein halber Liter rein. Damit ist die Größe wirklich gut für einen Beilagensalat geeignet. Da die Schüsseln auch hitze- und sogar ofenfest sind, sind sie auch gut für eine Vorsuppe oder eine (sogar überbackene) Beilage zu benutzen.  Die Schüsseln machen einen robusten Eindruck. Es wird sich im täglichen Gebrauch zeigen, wie haltbar sie sind. Sollte mir Abnutzung oder besondere Empfindlichkeit gegen Stöße auffallen, werde ich das hier noch nachtragen. Wenn dazu nichts mehr steht, war also alles in Ordnung.  Die Form der Schüsseln ist untereinander nicht absolut identisch. Man sieht das auf dem Foto, welches die Schüsseln von der Seite als Stapel zeigt. Hier sind die Abstände zwischen den Schüsseln nicht gleich – vermutlich wegen Produktionstoleranzen. Das sieht man aber nur im Stapel, auf dem Tisch fällt das nicht auf.  Die Oberfläche von 5 Schüsseln war okay und auch gegen das Licht betrachtet absolut makellos – es gab keine Pickel oder Farbveränderungen. Bei der sechsten Schüssel waren allerdings einige kleine Fehler auf der Außenseite (siehe Bild). Hier waren einige schwarze Punkte vorhanden und an einer Stelle sogar ein kleines Loch in der Glasur. Das sollte nicht passieren und spricht nicht gerade für die Qualitätssicherung.  Die Schüsseln werden in einem schlichten Pappkarton mit Aufkleber Made in China geliefert. Das ist sicherlich eher nichts zum Verschenken, das Angebot richtet sich ja auch eher an Firmen. Eine Anleitung oder ein Beipackzettel ist nicht dabei. Daher gibt es es auch keine Pflegehinweise.  Pflegehinweise gibt es lediglich in der Produktbeschreibung auf der Angebotsseite. Hier wird eine Reinigung von Hand empfohlen. Mal ehrlich, wir reden hier von Amazon Commercial, das sich an gewerbliche Nutzer richtet. Welcher Gastronom spült denn sein Geschirr noch von Hand? Ich glaube aber auch nicht, dass Maschinenreinigung für die Schüsseln ein Problem ist, vor allem weil sie ja laut Produktbeschreibung sogar 1300 Grad aushalten sollen und keine Bedruckung haben, sie in der Spülmaschine angegriffen werden könnte. Den ersten Spülgang haben sie jedenfalls problemlos überstanden. Wenn sich doch noch Probleme zeigen, werde ich das hier nachtragen.  Fazit: Die Schüsseln gefallen mir gut. Sie sind unauffällig und schlicht und passen eigentlich zu jedem weißen Geschirr. Leider wird der Eindruck von der einen fehlerhaften Schüssel getrübt. Die Fehlstelle ist zwar nicht groß, trotzdem sollte so etwas bei einer Qualitätsprüfung auffallen. Daher und für die Empfehlung zur Handwäsche gibt es einen Stern Abzug.  Ich hoffe, ich konnte mit dieser ausführlichen und ehrlichen Bewertung weiterhelfen. Sollten noch Fragen offen sein: Einfach die Kundenfragen-Funktion benutzen, ich versuche immer auf solche Anfragen zu antworten."
"Mia moglie ama questo genere di prodotto e per lei, pur avendone già tantissime, non sono mai abbastanza. Il set è composto da 6 ciotole, di piccole dimensioni di circa 17 cm di diametro, che sono realizzate in porcellana, molto belle, eleganti e semplici allo stesso tempo. E’ proprio la loro semplicità che le rende eleganti, anche su una tovaglia di un certo valore. Ottime per servirsi antipasti, noccioline, olive ma anche insalata. Utili per un utilizzo quotidiano ma anche per quando si hanno degli ospiti. Bello il design, ritengo che vista la qualità ed il materiale con cui sono state realizzate, siano anche durevoli. Possono essere lavate a mano o in lavastoviglie, resistendo bene anche ad alte temperature. Proprio per questo motivo possono essere direttamente nel forno, ma ance in microonde e nel congelatore. La finitura bianca li rende utilizzabili in ogni tipologia di cucina e con ogni tipologia di materiale e colore. Consiglio l’acquisto."
"Bis dato habe wir für unseren Salat stets die guten alten Glasschüsseln gehabt, die man früher sozusagen als Aussteuer für die erste eigene Wohnung geschenkt bekam! Kennt ihr das auch noch...???  Heute bestellten wir uns endlich mal einen Satz neuer Schüsseln aus Porzellan! Und die sehen und machen im Schrank sogar eine richtig gute Figur. Den unsere Kinder nutzen diese sogar jetzt verstärkt als Müslischüssel. Man muss dazu sagen, die Kids haben vorher sehr wenig Müsli zum Frühstück gegessen...  Natürlich sind sie waschbar in der Spülmaschine.  Die Größe der Schüsseln sind eigentlich optimal für jede Art von gebrauch ausgebaut. Im Durchmesser sind sie knappe 18 cm und die höhe der Schüsseln beträgt 8 cm. Kurzum, da passt ne menge rein"
"I really like these bowls, they are great quality and well made. They blend in well with our current white plate set and are easy to match. They are fine in the dishwasher can be hand-wash as expected. They do feel slightly thinner but for a side salad or cereal they are the perfect size. They arrived packaged very well and are a decent option to extend your current dining set, but at just over five pounds per dish i find these quite over priced especially as they have no design or artwork on them."
"Il set di ciotole in questione è ottimo sotto molti punti di vista, almeno in quelli che io prendo in considerazione quando devo determinare la qualità di un prodotto facente parte di questa tipologia. In primis, Il materiale utilizzato per la loro realizzazione è una porcellana di alta qualità, la quale, tra le altre cose, come da descrizione, è in grado di resistere alle alte temperature, in secundis, trovo che il loro design, seppur minimale, sia decisamente elegante. Una particolare nota di merito va al packaging utilizzato da Amazon per imballarle, il quale permette che le stesse possano arrivare integre sino a casa vostra. In conclusione, ritengo che possano essere un ottimo acquisto."
"Die Salatschüsseln sind sehr sauber verarbeitet (Made in China). Nirgends sind Fehler oder Unsauberkeiten in der Verarbeitung zu erkennen. Dazu stehen sie absolut plan. Sie haben einen oberen Durchmesser von 17,7 cm, sind 5,6 cm hoch und haben einen unteren Durchmesser von 8,7 cm. Das Design ist schlicht und so fügen sich sich auch gut in ein bestehendes Geschirr-Set ein. Natürlich dürfen sie auch in die Spülmaschine und haben eine erste Wäsche dort auch schadlos überstanden. Einzig den Preis von aktuell knapp 35 Euro finde ich doch, sage wir mal ambitioniert, weswegen ich einen Stern abziehe."
"Die 6 Salatschüsseln in Weiß von Amazon Commercial kommen gut und sicher verpackt zu Hause an. Sie haben eine Größe von 17,78cm und sind somit bestens für Beilagensalate geeignet.  Die Verarbeitung ist einwandfrei und sie sind auch ofenfest, mikrowellen- und gefrierschrankgeeignet. Sie sind aus relativ dickem Porzellan und somit für den täglichen Gebrauch ideal. Es wird vom Hersteller empfohlen, die Salatschüsseln von Hand zu spülen."
"Conforme à la description  Lot de 6 bols, bonne contenance la porcelaine à l'air solide et de bonne qualité A voir à l'usage et dans le temps"
"c'est du porcelaine blanche, mais un bol à salade simple et pas trop cher c'est pas si facile à trouver, on voulait juste avoir de petit bol pour salade individuelle et aussi pour soupe chinois, ils sont idéalement large sans socle et pas cher Six pièces très bien emballé: pas de casse"
"Ces bols sont destinés à recevoir vos compositions de salades ou éventuellement du potage. Ils sont extrêmement basiques, de couleur blanche uniforme ce qui les rend un peu tristounets. Leur contenance est également un petit peu faible. On aurait souhaité les avoir un peu plus profonds. Pour autant, le rapport qualité prix est intéressant et ils vous rendront des services."
"Lot de 6 bols Amazon de belle qualité, très pratique, aux usages multiples. Je les utilisent très souvent pour plein d’occasions, salades, soupes, desserts, pour un peu tout quoi. Leurs design classique est un point fort, ils pourront s’associer facilement à votre service actuel, c’est top ! Je les mets dans mon lave vaisselle, ça passe très bien. Reçu bien emballé, ça réduit considérablement les risques du transport. Le rapport qualité prix est correct. Je les recommande. ⭐️ 5 étoiles ⭐️"
"Sehr schönes Schüssel Set. Das zeitlose Design passt gut in unsere Küche. Passt auch zu einer Kombination mit anderer Ausführung.  Die Größe ist sowohl für Salat als auch für Suppen geeignet.  Positiv ist, dass diese Schüsseln hitzefet sind und im Backofen als auch in der Mikrowelle benutzt werden können, auch Kälte macht den Produkten nichts.  Spülmaschinen geeignet sind sie auch noch.  Die Produkte machen einen robusten und haltbaren Eindruck. Wir benutzen sie schon eine Weile und wir möchten diese nicht mehr hergeben. Es sind keinerlei Verarbeitungsfehler zu erkennen, prima Qualität.  Kaufempfehlung ohne Einschränkung."
"Nettes 6er Set, ideal für die kommende Sommergrillsaison, da sind solche Schalen doch immer hilfreich.der Preis ist fair, in der Spülmaschine gut zu reinigen, die Schüsseln kommen sehr gut verpackt beim Käufer an."
"Good + Quite thick, feel very robust + Good quality, with smooth surfaces and edges, much better that those you get from the large furniture chain + Simple but classy design, goes with almost everything  Not so good - None"
"Wow am I ever impressed! These bowls are extra heavy duty & have wonderful heavy lids that fit nicely & not too tight. The packaging was wonderful as well. I was concerned about them being transported since they’re glass, but fabulous as well! So glad I ordered these & not the cheaper ones I started to order!"
I bake a cake and drink Vermouth.
"The smallest bowl does not fit flush in a nested set with the others which is very sad. Not sure if this is a quality issue or across the board design choice. But otherwise these bowls are smooth, sturdy, easy to clean and store, and have no quality flaws. They came in very secure packaging."
the trick to these lids is to push down in the right spot. settle the lid on the bowl. each lid has two taps. place the heel of your hand on the lid above one of the tabs and gently/firmly push down with the heel of your hand on the top of the lid above the tab. should hear it snap into place. to remove the lid pull up on one of the tabs. don't forget to steady the bowl with your other hand. once it snaps it stays on really well. the only bad thing is that it's NOT an air tight seal. did a water test and the water poured out with the lid firmly in place.  the lids are a hard plastic and feel sturdy. they look/feel like they could warp during the dry hot cycle in a dishwasher. maybe take them out before the dry cycle. another review stated that they put the lids on the top rack and did fine. but handwashing seems the best way to keep the lids in better shape and fit. hope this helps.
"I had a set of very nice stainless steel bowls I wanted to replace, since the sound of any metal interacting with the metal makes me cringe. I love the glass set. The sizes are convenient and although I wasn't looking for covers, they turned out to be a bonus."
"These are very nice glass bowls. They are heavy and good quality. The lids fit well; I only hand wash them. I spent a lot of time looking at glass and metal bowls before I decided on these. I wanted something I could put lids on and put in the refrigerator with a lid. I don't like plastic as it can discolor. I also wanted something that could go in the microwave, and I don't like the sound of mixing beaters on metal. Plus, many people mentioned that metal bowls start to scratch quickly. These are perfect. They are a little heavy, so I don't use them for all mixing. It's nice that they can be used for mixing, storing, heating in microwave, etc. I recommend these."
"The bowls themselves are very sturdy, sparkling clear and more lightweight than I expected. The only problem, the lids do not fit snugly. That's not a dealbreaker for me so all in all I'm happy 😊"
"Pleased with these bowls and the storage of the bowls and lids is very efficient. Not too sure how sturdy the bowls are, already have a chip in the rim of a bowl from them clicking together when stacking and handling, but that does not inhibit their use. The lids are easy to use and work well."
"They can do triple duty as storage (in the fridge or cabinet), cooking (in the microwave) and eating. Perfect for minimalists! The price is also great."
"Expected these would be ""okay for the purpose"" because of the reasonable price, but was surprised on several fronts. They are heavy, sturdy bowls. Nothing ""cheesy"" or ""cheap alternative"" about them. And the variety of sizes fits every need. When the recipe says ""...in a separate bowl.."" you've got one just the right size. Couldn't be happier!"
"Extremely sturdy, very thick great value for money. I can't say how good this deal was. Absolutely what I was looking for, not found in retail shops. They are really big , look great quality. It is must for every kitchen. Highly recommend this above others like this, I have tried some before."
I usually go with Pyrex but wanted something with lids. Love these bowls. The 5 different sizes are great to have and the lids do the job. I just needed to remind my husband not to put the lids in the microwave.
My daughter had glass mixing bowls on her Christmas list so I bought her these. They seem to be really nice and the lids fit well. I am sure she will get a lot of use from them. She was glad to receive.
"These bowls are sturdy, thick glass that won’t break easily on my granite counters. I’ve used all but one of the sizes so far. I plan to hand wash the lids for their longevity. Lids are strong enough I can stack them in the frig. When nested they seem heavy so storing in lower cabinets is a must for me."
A good set of nesting bowls for cooking. The lids wash well in the dishwasher. There's no need to overpay for good cookware.
"These bowls are the proper size I was looking for. I've bought others, but they turned out to be too small. Now I have a variety of sizes to work with."
"I like these bowls and lids very much. Only one caution is the lids do not make an air-tight seal. If you have liquid in the bowl and tip or shake it, the liquid will seep out. So if you are marinating and want to flip this container with the lid on, you will have a mess to clean up. Otherwise, they serve their purpose very well. Also, the lids are NOT microwave safe as stated in the product information."
A 10+ product Absolutely the best Great quality very pleased 😀
"I just love these bowls!! Very thick glass and the lids are awesome, saves money because you don’t have to use plastic wrap all the time"
These are exactly what I was looking for! Very nice bowls.Will order again.Says they are out of stock. Hopefully they restock soon!
"I decided to get rid of my plastic mixing bowls and saw this set on Amazon, these bowls totally work fit the bill."
We threw away the plastic and will never look back!!!!
Great addition to our RV needs. Love to make regular dinner meals on the road using these bowls with lids. Easy to store left overs in too.. Don't look any further buy them you will be happy with your purchase!!
Sturdy and light weight. I use them for everything
Glass storage is better than plastic. These go in the dishwasher and come out clear and clean. Lids are d/w safe as well. So much easier to identify foods in the fridge with see through rather than opaque or solid color plastic bowls.
Good price
Love these bowls! They are great sizes...the lids are sturdy and fit well.
"All of the bowls stacked are too heavy to lift with one hand, need two"
love the stacking of bowls and lids.. space saving
Really nice bowls!! The lids could be stronger!!
Work well and keep food fresh
Cost worthy
Great set!
Perfect addition to my mix ware
Great sturdiness and thickness. Bowl stays put while mixing things inside. Great assortment of sizes. You need to press the tops down on until you hear a click. The bowls store food well. Added bonus is that you can heat up food in the bowls.
I love them!
The lids fit good
Love these bowls!
I just Love these bowls! They are heavy and durable! The tops snaps on easy and seals well!
These bowls are really heavy duty. Perfect for mixing and storage. Exactly what I was looking for.
I love them. Very strong glass. Worth the money
Perfect
Easy to clean. Visibility in the fridge.
Good value for a variety of sizes.
Good set of bowls.
"The lids to this bowl set are not tight. Come off. cannot transport bowls , must use rubber band."
"lids are awful, they do not fit they do not stay on the bowls are great, thinking of returning due only to the lids"
"Overall the bowls are very nice thick glass. Very durable, and I like that they are easy to store because they can nest in each other. However, the lids are a huge hassle. They're very flimsy and aren't airtight. When at room temp, they're ok, but when you're trying to cover something warm or a little hotter, for some reason the lids don't stay on. They pop off one side which is incredibly frustrating. I found that bending the lid a little helps it hold, but I expected better than this."
"I've been searching for bowls with lids that fit - every time for every customer. I have yet to find a product where some reviews don't contain complaints about lids not fitting. I got lucky with my first stainless steel set; the lids fit perfectly. Unfortunately that's not the case for these bowls. I love the bowls themselves - nice heavy glass at a great price. I wanted microwaveable bowls with lids for transporting and heating food at dinner parties. Thankfully these bowls fit inside my bowls with lids that fit and can't be microwaved, so I'll work around it that way. :)"
"The bowls themselves are nice and heavy duty. The issue is the lids just sit on the bowls, they do not ""snap"" on. There is nothing air or water tight about these, which means as mixing bowls, they'll be good. In order to store food in them, they'll need to be plastic wrapped prior."
I first wrote lids do not seal you must work hard to get them to snap secure..
"I purchased this set specifically because I was looking for glass bowls that came with fitted lids. Well, the lids on this set fit so loosely they almost just sit on top. You definitely can't seal them air tight like you can with tupper ware type containers. The bowls themselves seem good and sturdy. I did drop one from a relatively low height, though, and it completely shattered into a tiny pieces, so I'm not sure if that's typical of all glass or this one just shatters easier than most. If you're not clumsy like me and don't drop glass and if you don't need air tight lids, then this set will work fine for you. It's a good basic glass bowl set."
The bowls are fabulous. The problem is with the lids. Some fit secure and some don’t fit at all and pop off continually.
The bowls themselves are very nice and I like that they have snap on lids. Very pleased with purchase.
"The bowls themselves were fine, but the lids were a joke. I was also disappointed in the size of the largest bowl. As I was intending to use them as mixing bowls and for food storage, they were useless to me. Returned them."
"I am happy I bought these, however I am not happy that the lip does not seal as stated. The lids fit loosely and you can easily spill food items from the bowls."
"Great for price, but they won’t last very long. I placed one into another, I guess with too much force, and it shattered. I thought I might get a knick in the glass after I lost my grip on it but it just shattered in the larger one."
Bowls are good but are too slippery. Whish they have other glass.
"I've been wanting some glass bowls with lids and found these. The bowls themselves are very nice and sturdy. The problem is the lids don't have a snug fit. They fit over top of the bowl and do not attach. I was expecting a lid that would stay on the bowl not a cover that does not attach. Had I known that, I would NOT have purchased these bowls. I'm disappointed."
Nice bowls.. hate that the lids do not fit. Would not purchase again.
I love these and I highly recommend! Only problem is one of the bowls came with a big chip on the rim.
Bowls are very heavy and hard to get out when nested
The glass bowls are really nice but the tops don't have a tight seal fluid and juices can spill out
"The bowls are great. As I expected. But, the lids do not fit as tightly as I would like. They are not leak proof. But, considering the price, acceptable."
"I love these bowls ♥️... Multi-use is a major plus. Lids are not microwave safe. Boo 😒 Otherwise, perfect for the money"
The top do not stay / seal to bowl’s.
Lids don’t stay on
"I wanted to love these, but 2 of the covers don’t fit on their bowls!! They don’t snap shut :( really disappointed"
Lids too big. Don’t seal. Pay a little extra for quality. Unfortunately I just realized after unpacking upon my move in. Lesson learned- open upon receipt and check before return window expires
One lid didn’t fit correctly and won’t seal; that’s important to me. Amazon customer service couldn’t help unless I returned the whole set.
"Great bowl, and low price. Very good quality."
So our son is going on a 5 day kayaking trip …. We needed a mess kit that was flexible. His Scoutmaster highly recommended “a dog bowl”…..mentally this went against every grain in my body - but then you think about the flexibility of this silicone divided bowl - it makes perfectly sense! I was looking at a dog bowl that said “woof” on the bottom but it wasn’t divided. (Ha) the only down fall with this bowl for a human is that it is flimsy for like soups etc…… for a a mess kit. But he should be okay with this 💐💐
"The water side collapsed on its self twice during normal use sending dog water all over the floor of our RV. if using for camping where it’s only holding something while the dog is using it I’m sure it’s fine but it’s not suitable as a bowl to leave out, slightly stiffer silicone is needed to make this a 5 star product."
I am using this as a traveling water container for watercolor painting. It works perfect- the two sides allows me to have a clean water container and a rinse container. It clips onto my art bag.
This is great for big dogs! Love the concept and wish they make the same thing for smaller mouths too :)
"Bowl is awesome. I am going to say that if you have a large breed dog this is not for you. It works well for our day trips where all we take is water. But food and water will not work. Small dog maybe medium but my big dog looked at me and said, “your kidding right” LOL"
"Great idea and would probably work if you and your dog were out for a walk. But, we used in backseat of truck when we travel with our German Shepherd. He tore it up 2nd time out."
Sturdy enough for eating and snacks. Folds away after washing. Our boston terrier has not tipped it over and seems to like it. It will also be easy to travel with.
"Works great. Very easy to collapse though, if it is filled with water, the water can sometimes weigh the bowl down causing it to collapse. Nothing too crazy though, it works well for outdoor adventures."
They just were to flimsy. Tried in crate and just touch them and water spilled. I don’t suggest them at all for traveling. Sorry for bad review.
Very handy to throw in a bag. I like the two different compartments for food or water. I only wish it was a little more sturdy and not so flimsy.
It seems durable and the carabiner is very handy. The size is perfect. I hope it will last.
Loved the two compartments to reduce items having to be carried. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the plastic is a bit flimsy as compared to other retractable dog bowls I have.
"I keep it at my brother's place for when I stay over when I bring my dog with me, it's easy to wash and it comes with a clip so I can carry it around with me ifni need to, it also collapses so putting in my bag will use up less room It's fantastic!"
"This is much larger than I was expecting. So far it's sturdy, durable and easy to use so we plan to keep it, but I may have been better off with two small silicone bowls rather than this large divided one."
This is great for travel. I wouldn’t recommend for daily use because the dog food ends up wet and it is easier to fill bowls that are separate.
"It's deep, narrow and soft rubber. Deep and narrow does not seem comfortable for my cat to get at food and water. The rubber is so soft and bendy I worry that the food and water will spill since I plan on using it in the cat carrier while traveling by car."
Good for water bowl for watercolor painting.
I should have returned this. My dog is only 9 pounds and the idea was that she would carry it.
Just what I needed
Got it
"Love it, good quality, it is easy to use and feed my little boy, good price, I highly recommend it."
Works well. Easy to carry.
Too flexible
It's perfect for traveling fits anywhere and light weight
It seems like it'll last a while. My heelers snout fits in there but a bigger dog would probably struggle a little.
This item is great for big dogs! I hate to return it because it’s so nice but it’s just way too big for me to carry around for my 4lbs dog.. I wish they made this in small sizes too.
Goes in our day bag for meals on the go! Sturdier than I expected.
Love it!
Good quality
This is perfect to take camping or hiking. I like that it has two sections so you can feed and water your pet and only have to keep up with one container. Folds flat is a nice feature as well
Its fine to use on occasion. If the top would have been enforced with a plastic ring it sertanly would hold up better. Would not recommend for medium or large sized breeds.
Im always traveling and transporting puppies. When i saw this. it looked perfect because colapsable and a 2 in 1 so less to carry around. It really is a great product but not very sturdy. Its made out of a more rubbery material than regular colapsable bowls. Food and water often get mixed if you move the bowl at all. I am very impressed with how deep the bowl is. It holds more food and water than expected. I would recommend just be cautious if you need something sturdy.
It’s ok. Well made but super bulky
Very convenient and easy to carry.
Perfect
These are great because you can put one in each vehicle or one in a car one on a backpack etc. Small enough to feed and water your fur baby in a travel seat. Folds flat which makes it easy to bring with you. Silicone cleans easily!
"Love that they are stackable for space saving needs, also a plus that they’ve got lids!"
Wonderful!!!
They are easy to clean and sturdy. They are as expected.
I liked that they come with lids in case you make potato salad and have leftovers just put it in the fridge
Love the lightweight feel of the bowls! I would recommend them
nesting bowls( one fits inside other for stacking)
I love everything about these bowls!! The lids could fit a tad tighter but otherwise they are great! I love that they are light weight but very sturdy. Makes it easier for these arthritic hands.
Great product for the money
Excellent bowls of the most commonly used sizes.
Met my expectations
Good quality.
Works great.
"They are easy to clean, light weight but sturdy"
Good product for the price
I was disappointed because the largest bowl is not near as large as I was expecting. I wanted an extra large bowl and from what I ordered I thought that was what I was going to receive. But obviously not.
"The bowls are great and easy cleanup with one downside...The lids don't stay sealed, I was marinating steak tips overnight in the refrigerator and had to keep coming down to reseal, so for this reason I wouldn't recommend these."
"Overall good stainless steel bowl set for the price, only major issue is the covers which do not seal tight or at all when cold / refrigerated. To get a air tight seal must use plastic wrap or foil. The covers will not fully seal no matter how much I mess with it when the bowl is cold. If this is a big deal I would look for something more expensive."
Love the steel bowls. Dislike the flimsy plastic lids. They could be better. Wooden or just sturdier
Fitted covers are great
"Not very thick, lids don't stay on. Typical Chinese crap."
Lids don’t seal very well
"Quality is okay. You get what you pay for. However, the medium size bowl is missing a lid, which is disappointing because I bought the bowls to use for food storage."
The lids don't quite fit well.
Not as large
Cheaply made. Arrived missing the medium lid and the large lid already cracked. Bowls are ok very thin cheaply made
The lids don’t fit on that tight
Lids don’t fit properly
"Cheap metal, not study, middle bowl lid does not seal. Not recommend"
They're not dishwasher safe
The lids don’t stay on no matter how hard you try. Get another set. Great in theory but poor execution
"Light weight, comes with lids."
Nice and sturdy mixing bowls. Didn’t bend when I pushed it in hard either.
"Before I received the product, I thought they may heavy. When I see them, actually not heavy at all. They can use for multiple purposes. With lid, keep food clean. Nice!"
"I Use these for ingredients for my business,they are great. Best mixing bowls I’ve purchased"
Great quality!! Perfect for me!!
The lid is very poor designed. the lid did not seal well. Just returned them.
The metal is very thin which can possibly cause denting. The lids do not fit tightly and are always popping off. You get what you pay for. Not really great.
Not as heavy duty as I’d like but they do pretty well for what I need them for.
So they're generous with the plates but stingy with the bowls. The bowls work well and hold a considerably good amount of food within. They can get a bit loose/stretchy after being in the microwave for a bit. The temperature does quickly drop and the form holds well again at that point. I'll be updating this review if that ever becomes untrue.
"I'm a family of five and these colorful bowls are perfect for us. There's no more fighting over whose is whose, everyone has their own color lol They're super durable and microwaveable."
"Great serving bowl for microwaved food. Stews, soups, goulash, cereals etc. No staining, easy to clean by hand or dishwasher. Doesn't get extremely hot like glass or porcelain. No weird smells. Only one request. Produce another bowl exactly like this only 4 ounces more. That's for folks with larger appetites. :)"
"My only complaint is the limited selection of colors. This set had the closest colors to match the dishes I already have, but a wider color selection would be great."
They hold stuff.
These are great bowls. We've only been using glass bowls and the integrity started to fade causing hairline cracks. These are so sturdy easy to drink milk after a bowl of cereal from microwavable all of it. It's just good.
"The bowls look good. Colors are more muted, which makes them look more “grown-up” than other cereal bowls I’ve owned. They don’t feel flimsy or cheap. So far, they have held up well on the top rack of the dishwasher. Haven’t yet used them in the microwave."
Love these bowls!!! They feel like rubber but have are sturdy and just the right size.
This are great cereal bowls. They hold just the right amount.
I love these bowls. They seem very durable and I expect them to lay a long time.
"Light, durable, easy to clean, perfect for kids"
"Sturdy, easy to clean, microwavable, and perfect size for large bowl of cereal or I e cream!"
"Deep, durable, and divine colors I use them daily: cereal, small hand mixing, soups"
Absolutely worth the money. For everyday use you cant beat them.
These are a great size for cereal and soup. Easy clean and seem very durable.
I got these bowls because they were BPA free. So far they are great. We have had them a few months.
Very sturdy...dishwasher safe...microwave safe.
"These bowls are sturdy, cute and worth the price."
All around perfect. Best Amazon purchase! Great size and dishwasher safe. I love mine!
"Like!! They are strong, colorful and do fine in the dishwasher!"
Like every thing
"Love these bowls, exactly what I was looking for my family."
Great value!
Perfect bowls for my kiddo to use in the mornings for easy breakfast.
I like the depth
Great bowls
I recommend this product.
Gr8
We like the size and different colors of these bowls. I will definitely order more!
These bowls are great. They clean out well...even after red sauce. My son dropped one the other day without any damage.
"Perfect for yogurt, cereal or ice cream...."
Bowls are great and useful!
They are the perfect size and easy to clean
Big fan
great product for toddlers my 2 and 4 years cant break it and its great :)
I wasn't expecting how durable the bowls are 👍
"So nice, easy to clean and won’t break!!! 😊"
Love these bowls - bought 2 sets
My husband eats cereal daily. We needed bigger and sturdier bowls just for that. These are perfect and easy to clean. Will need to buy a second set so we have plenty.
My kids loved the bright colors and they are easy to wash and clean!
Liked them
I needed some bowls that my 4 boys wouldn't destroyer and at a good price. These covered all my expectations! I will buy more.
Love the bowls
I was very satisfied with this item would buy it again
I love them
"Like any bowl, spaghetti sauce stains them."
Very good size and shape. I use them every day. Light yet sturdy and they won’t break!
Family of 3 kids and these are great! Easy do clean and durable!
Bowl great for my family. I love the colors!
Great deep bowl
They are durable and easy to clean..
No stains and easy to clean
Salad soup ice cream and my favorite banana pudding
"I love the size and colors of the bowls and that I can use in microwave... which is why I purchased them, they do have a bit of an odor to them even after first couple washing. Used once in the microwave and the stain will not come out, I have scrubbed it several times, very disappointed in this."
"These bowls are very roomy for anything you might want to eat: salad, soup, cereal, and of course, ramen. I love that they are unbreakable, and the colors are a nice touch."
"So far, these bowls have worked out well. They seem to do fine in the dishwasher on the top shelf. I do wish they were just a little bit heavier. Otherwise they are a good value for the money."
These are great for cereal or soup because they have depth and the heavy plastic makes them durable.
Very good quality bowls.
"So, I bought these cereal bowls and they do in fact hold both cereal AS WELL as milk, so… mission accomplished there. However, I don’t know what got into me one day, but I decided to put several handfuls of walnuts into one of these bowls and you know what? It functioned as a walnut bowl as well! Crazy, right?! I think people are missing out if they think this is only for cereal. There’s a big old world full of walnut fans who need to know about this! Please re-label this bowl and let the people know the truth!"
The bowls were used at our chicken & Crust dinner. We make 100 gallons of gravy. The bowls make great gravy boats
figured i’d test out the unbreakable claim.. i’m sure if you weren’t actually *trying* to break the bowl it wouldn’t break. the other 5 are holding up just fine.
"I like how sturdy and deep these bowls are very good cereal and soup bowls! Great in the dishwasher or microwave just avoid putting Chef Boyardee spaghetti in it, it left a ring around the top that won't wash out but overall great bowls for the price! Yes I would buy again!"
"I bought these to replace some ceramic bowls I loved. These seem to be unbreakable, which is what I wanted. I have noticed that when washing out greasy foods, these take more time to get clean. Side note, they big cereal bowls!"
Mothers day gift! She loved them! Shes 85 years old and cant handle glads dishes anymore! These were perfect for her famous soup!
"Too be honest, I bought for kids for the colors. But am impressed by how sturdy and firm. Colors are very nice. Have not washed too many times so do not know if fade, but look good now and worth the buy"
Good for cereal and hot food and they cute
light weight ok for cereal
So disappointed when I received them they are so small will not buy from you again
They are light weight and sturdy.
Good sturdy product
"The bowls, spoons, and chopsticks arrived in perfect condition and I cannot express how lovely the bowls are!!! I am so happy with my purchase and highly recommend it."
"Great small bowl. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. One of the bowls have a weird spot in it (as shown in my picture), but I think it's just the bowl didn't get painted in that area. After washing it, it's still there but it feels like it's part of the bowl when you feel the bowl.  I did eat instant ramen in these bowls. I feel like these bowls are better for small portions or for noodles that don't have a lot of toppings in it. This bowl was the perfect size for me personally for instant ramen. My wonton noodles on the other hand, everything seemed crammed in, and it was hard to stir the noodles to mix everything together. These bowls will also definitely not be good for pho as pho has a lot of toppings to with it. However, it should work for a child.  Overall, this is a really good bowl for instant ramen or just for smaller portions."
"Absolutely beautiful ramen bowl set for 2. See attached pics. I love the rich colors in the bowls and the design. See picture #3 The bowls each come with a set of wooden chopsticks and soup spoon. The clear glazing is fantastic and smooth to the touch with no high or low spots. As with all new items, they should be washed before first use.  I handwashed them after using them for the first time and placed them in the dishwasher on subsequent uses. I always use the sterilization setting on my dishwasher and they've been coming out flawless every time so far. This tells me they're using a great clear coat on them even when they are washed and dried at a higher temperature than normal. The white circles on the bottom are not clear coated and i haven't received a scratch on my tables and that's a great thing! Very pleased with this great set. If you found my review helpful, please let me know. Thanks .  Having a blast using these beautiful ramen bowls."
"I love this cute ramen set. The bowls are absolutely stunning, I love the black and blue colors of the set. The bowls are large and better accommodate 2 packs of ramen. The spoons are large and have long handles and the chop sticks are coated, but not slippery. They both feel good in the hand and are easy to use. The bowls have a good weight to them, but aren't too heavy. Overall a fantastic set that I reach for more than my other set.  The only down side I had was that one spoon was broken during shipping. It broke where the handle meets the spoon. Some super glue and a bit of pressure though fixed it right up and you can't even tell."
"We were so happy to find a proper quality Ramen bowl. These are not cheap or lightweight by any means. Very good looking too! Of course we had to try Ramen in them first but there are just too many other good uses for such a nicely made bowl. These will hold about 2 cups of liquid so the sizing is just right. I'm sure to eat breakfast cereal or spaghetti from these some time soon. The shape is not top heavy and fits right in your hand. Definitely microwave safe as I just discovered - the bowls do not get hot, just the food. An excellent addition to our kitchenware!"
"The best set of ramen bowls I've ordered...so far! I love the colors and the glossy finish...and whether the bowls are 42 oz or 36 oz, the set is still well worth the price! I don't know what kind of wood the chopsticks and spoons are made from, however, they are all sturdy and very smooth. I like that I can put a pack of ramen in one bowl and it still won't reach the rim! I don't know what else I can say, so I'll let you judge by what my photos show!"
Love it ! I have some 2 piece bakeware that is pretty similar to this color and pattern. So I wanted to match it somehow. I love these ramen bowels. I use them for everything aside from Asian cuisine. Nice quality and don’t feel cheap. No damages during transit and I received the accessories too ( not pictured). Would get again- hold descent amount of noodles - a good servings plus some worth. I have fettuccine Alfredo I made in the bowel.
These bowls are nice quality. They are hefty as one would imagine ceramic bowls of this size would be. The base is wide enough to provide adequate stability even when full. The finish seems to be durable thus far. As for the chopsticks and spoons that were included - those seem to be pretty cheap. The wood finish almost seems painted on. I don’t plan on using the utensils for anything food related.
This is a beautiful set of Ramen bowls. Each bowl has a vibrant blue color and a glossy finish. They are a good weight without being too heavy so I don’t have any concerns about them breaking. The set of 2 bowls also comes with 2 pair of chopsticks and 2 large spoons. In addition to being actual ramen bowls these bowls would also make a beautiful accent piece somewhere in the home.
"These are absolutely beautiful bowls, though I like that they came with the chopsticks and spoons, I likely wont end up using them due to them being wooden. They are very pretty though.  The bowls are prefect for ramen and I love them."
"The bowels came well packaged and have a very nice finish. However,the looked smaller then my other bowels. So after measuring their capacity it was only 36oz. I am giving it 3 stars tho because they are nice"
"I love eating ramen very much, every time I go to a Japanese restaurant to eat Japanese ramen I love their bowls and wooden spoons, I finally bought the right one today, the quality of the bowls is perfect."
Comes in perfect condition! So beautifully made! Perfect for Asian foods
"Love these, sturdy, big and good looking."
The packaging is very complete and very sturdy! This bowl is so pretty! I love this spoon that goes with it! It is a good choice to eat noodle soup or to make stir-fry! I like it so much
"Whether you're actually a ramen fan or just like to have a lot of soup, these are a couple of gorgeous bowls to do that in. They also are a bit larger than the bowls the ramen is served in at a local Ramen shop, but that's just a plus.  Basically, they're just a gorgeous, high-quality ramen bowl set and that's it."
"The sinks were very pretty but unfortunately the lower rim of the bowls were not level, warped I would say, and would not sit flush on my cabinets. I will have to send them back and find some that are level."
The shampoo bowls were warped. I ordered twelve shampoo bowls and when I placed them inside the cabinets most of them were warped. I returned two of them because they would rock back and forth from corner to corner. I installed the ones that were ok and some that were not warped as bad.
I like it and it's so comfortable to do everything whith it
Great shampoo bowl!!
"Beautiful porcelain bowls!!! I purchased the set of bowls, what a great choice. LOVE these bowls!  First, they are very shiny, durable and beautiful looking. Beautiful bowls I love blue and patterns. I loved these bowls the minute I laid my eyes on them, they are thick porcelain with great detail colors.  Second, they’re nice, sturdy. I've crashed other glassware into them a few times, and the bowls have not chipped. The different sizes are perfect for my needs. They can be used for soup, pasta cereal, main dishes, side dishes, popcorn, you name it!  Third, the bowls are microwavable and dishwasher safe. They don’t get nuclear hot in my microwave!! We were looking for something that would be easy to clean but still durable enough to withstand chili with lots of cheese, the bowls are easy to clean. I'm able to heat soups on the stove directly in the bowl which is great. Then I just just easily wash them when I'm through.  I absolutely love them! I will most definitely buy another set and recommend purchase."
"I just love these! Absolutely gorgeous! Perfect size for soup, salad, etc for a good-sized portion. Super high quality. Shiny finish. Sturdy. Durable. Easy to clean. Truly dishwasher safe. Stackable although the sides are vertically straight. The lip on the bottom makes them easier to handle. These are made of better heavier ceramic, not the lightweight kind some mugs are made of that get super hot to handle from the microwave."
"Bigger than I expected, but that's a good thing. My daughter likes them for soup and a bowl of cereal. Thanks!"
I really like it. They are in good quality and suitable size for me. I am so surprised about the amazing outfit. I will purchase an other set as 4 bowls are not enough for my family.
"Love these bowls!! Beautiful design, easy to clean and deep. They can go in the oven or dishwasher too.  If your looking for amazing bowls that are beautiful too, this is the set for you!!"
I love these bowls! They're exactly as described and perfect for my needs.
I love it I used it for many years now it’s so good
Great product.
Well worth the price. Very thick and sturdy.Nice deep bowls for soups and salads. Plus they are so beautiful.
I love the color
"very happy with the quality, have gotten many compliments on these bowls"
"Very sturdy. Good size,Microwave friendly and look great as well."
Great
"These lustrous bowls have a rich deep color. I would say it’s a coolish green, with black undertones. It goes very well with my grey dishes. It’s nice having 6 of them. I mostly use for cut fruit. They hold a good serving of fruit but I would say they are too small for soup, unless it’s a small portion. Definitely too small to hold a whole can of Progresso soup, but would hold half. The color and glaze make this a unique product. It’s a great value for the money. They fit well in the dishwasher. Would definitely recommend."
I was looking for something more like the photos. Very disappointed. I planed to.use them as planter pots across from a waterfall painting. These do not match.
"I love the Nebule blue pattern of these bowls. Exactly what I wanted. 15 OZ bowls. Two issues, however. NO PRINTED INFO on bottoms. Have no idea if I can use in microwave. Should have ounce size and manufacturer name also on bottoms. The other issue is that these don't stack well at all. I need to refigure storage. Otherwise, love these."
I gave these bowls as a gift. Everyone loved them! They are absolutely beautiful! The bowls are the perfect size for soups and stews. They are easy to clean. Highly recommend!
I fell in love with the light fog green and got dark blue bowls instead. They are nice bowls. Thick and sturdy and had they had other photos to show the variance I might not be as upset but feels like false advertisement. The color is nothing like the picture feels like a whole different option
"I bought these for my room mate who was always searching for a large bowl. Mixing bowl, plastic bowls anything big enough for a man size meal. He loves them and remarks every day how great his bowl is. The colors are beautiful too."
"These bowls are great for dessert or even a small bowl of cereal or soup. Good size to hold on to and carry, clean well by hand or in the dishwater."
"They are shallow but wide. It makes them convenient for the dishwasher but not si convenient for the dish shelf. They are used for generous portions of soup and cereal , and are also large enough to use ask small serving bowls ."
Love these. Immediately bought a set of smaller ones to match.
Will be buying more.
"In my house we love to eat soup and stew and these deep dish is beautiful, comfortable, and sturdy."
These bowls are drop-dead gorgeous. You can feel the quality the second you pick it up. It makes a great gift for anyone even if they don't need bowls...they will love them.
"The bowls aren't exactly as they look online. Where there's a little light blue or white halfway the bowl online, when you receive it, it's no dripping of light blue or white coloring. The bowl is really nice though."
Beautiful bowls. Great color
I like everything except that these do not nest inside / stack well in the cupboard. So only two fit on a shelf. They work well in both the dishwasher and the microwave. The portion is good for soup etc.
"I’ve had this set for a month. 2 weeks in, two bowls have chips."
Good size bowls
Love everything about these bowls. Beautiful and heavy. Perfect for bulky Mexican stews and soups! Ha ha Will be ordering more.
Beautiful colors. Very well packaged. Nice size
These bowls are ok but not even close to the color seen online...these are very dark blue with no defining color change... wouldnt buy again...
"I am very disappointed in these bowls. I see everyone else’s looking amazing, mine looks Nothing like the photos."
My husband wanted some bigger deeper bowls. Mainly for his ice cream or sherbet. He is very happy with these bowls. They are very sturdy and of excellent quality.
"These are very beautiful and sturdy bowls. The blue color and the pattern on it looks very attractive. They can be good for pasta, cereal or salad. The good part is these bowls are microwave and dishwasher safe. I am very happy with my purchase. Definitely recommend it."
"My first ceramic bowls , they are beautiful, any food in them will make the food look appetizing and delicious"
"The set look outstanding and can hold lots of food, much more than I expect. It feels smooth inside and out also, I highly recommend it."
The glazing is so pretty. They are the perfect size and depth. I would highly recommend.
these are high quality bowls highly recommended looks better in person.
Very very nice bowls.
"I absolutely love these dishes. Let me tell you why: they are beautiful , the color is just gorgeous. they all have their own unique touch as well. they are the perfect size. they fit very comfortably in my small hands and I can hold them without discomfort. They hold a lot of product. They are fairly deep. They are well made. I do not feel any sharp ceramic parts or glaze, everything is well done. They are to be used in Microwave and Dishwasher. Overall,, these are incredible and I’m super happy with the color and quality! Love this style and colors of these bowls. I ordered the smaller bowls also. Also have the mugs to match."
I got these for my 16 year Grandson. This is what he wanted and he loves them!
These are a great size for making taco bowls or any sort of grain bowl. The whole family loves them. They match my Hull dishes very nicely
Easy to clean dishwasher microwave safe highly recommend
These bowls are even more beautiful in person than I imagined! They are sturdy and a nice size for everyday/multi-purpose use. No need to worry about their being damaged in transit either since they are packaged to survive any kind of mishandling the postal service can throw at them. Highly recommended!
Tired of flat plate like bowls that spill soups out. These bowls have a nice side that keeps food where you put it.
PACKAGE CAME SAFETY PACKED! I LOVE THE DISHES!! NICE AND HARD! HEAVY TOO I LOVE IT! IT HOLDS!! MUST ORDER ! ACTUALLY BIGGER IN PERSON
"If you don't already know, pyrex is amazing stuff. Some of the best glass items ever! I ordered these without the lids. I already own a set with the lids and I like those too. I am using these as just mixing bowls instead of storage bowls. I love to use these to mix anything from cake batter to salads to eggs and everything in between. The three different sizes are great. Sometimes you need a smaller bowl, sometimes you need a bigger one. Your needs are pretty well covered with this set. If you don't have a set with lids, I highly recommend getting the lids. I love my set with the lids. They fit great and you don't have to use plastic wrap or tin foil. Plus the bowls and lids clean up great in the dishwasher. I love to cook and do so daily. So these bowls get used A LOT. The quality is so great that they will last you for many years. The glass is hard to break and never stains and food easily comes right off. I love that it's made in the USA! I would definitely recommend these bowls to anyone. Even if you don't cook all the time. When you do cook these will come in handy! If you found my review helpful, please click the helpful button."
"I purchased these bowls because every household needs a set of Pyrex bowls. It's actually in the Constitution if you read between the lines. I received the bowls and right away I noticed there were some small bubbles in the glass, right at the lip of the two smaller bowls and near the bottom on the largest bowl. These bubbles aren't really a nuisance for me since I don't plan on using these bowls in the oven (there's a possibility that air bubbles in the Pyrex and used in the oven can, how do you say, go boom?), but I figured I'd give World Kitchen/ Pyrex a shout to let them know about the defect.  The day after I sent them an email I received a reply asking for photos of the bubbles and the size of the affected bowls. Apparently Pyrex pieces have a warranty on them and World Kitchen is replacing them.  The bowls themselves get 5 stars because they're exactly what I needed and they work (even if there are air bubbles), and World Kitchen gets 5 stars for their awesome customer service."
"The size of these bowls are a follows. The small size looks GREAT for dips like guacamole or homemade salsa. The middle bowl is perfect for fruit salad or putting veggies out at a party. The large bowl is a GREAT mixing bowl size. While they're all advertised as ""mixing bowls"" the largest bowl seems the best for it, but the smallest bowl is perfect for mixing guacamole or a cheese dip etc. I'm in love with these. I love the lip on the edge as it makes for easier grabbing when these bowls are coming in or out of the fridge, oven or microwave. Overall, love these bowls! Great product by Pyrex!"
"Unbelievable! Amazon needs to get its act together. I was sent obvious fake Pyrex, sold by and fulfilled by Amazon. Look at what I recieved compared to a surviving bowl from my old set. The stamps are all blurry and the glass has a cheap grey tint to it, sharp edges, visible chips, defects, air bubbles throughout. Real Pyrex is heavy with smooth rounded edges and a distinct teal hue to the glass. This are 100% knockoffs from who knows where. I'm sending them straight back so watch out for them if you buy. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning these and going to the store to get a real set. I guess you really do pay for convenience!"
"I was under the impression that lids would be included but I'm not upset about it. To be honest I probably never would have used lids.  So I wanted to leave a review because I dropped all three bowls today when pulling out of my cupboard. I had them at like 5 feet above the floor. None of them broke or cracked or anything. And they probably should've because it was a very loud crash. They were stacked together so they collided. I still have my favorite mixing bowls! Totally happy with these bowls!  I have another set of metal mixing bowls (with lids lol) that I purchased before these, but still recently. They are already dented and I don't know HOW because I have never dropped them. I'll be buying Pyrex from now on."
"I pour boiling water in it to clean, and it broke into little pieces, is that normal?"
I love these Pyrex mixing bowls. I purchased two sets to replace the slightly chipped 40+ year old Pyrex bowls I started housekeeping with as a 19 year old girl in my first apartment. I use these for everything. I like the lip on these bowls. My old Pyrex bowls did not have any kind of lip. It is easier to hold onto the new ones when doing food prep. This is a basic staple of any kitchen and pretty much an American classic. I recommend this to anyone for any kitchen. Read the directions to learn what you can and should not do with these bowls. They are a breeze to clean up and look really sharp.
"They came fairly well packaged, exactly what I needed since we had no mixing bowls that you could easily get your hand into to mix things and almost all our bowls were way too big for everything. The smallest bowl is a little too small for anything I make but I'm sure it has its uses! The biggest bowl is great for making box cakes and such, and I typically use the medium bowl for making chicken salad or pancakes. The bowls are sturdy and thick and I'm hoping they last a long time!"
"I love Pyrex dishes because I can bake in the, which is what I did. I made a basketball cake for my son’s birthday....much cheaper than the sphere baking pans and has many more uses"
"Great price on set of glass mixing bowls. My poor sister has been using hideous plastic mixing bowls someone gave her. I couldn't bear it and sent these her way. She is inspired, she has been cooking and baking more because these bowls, compared to what she had enhance the appearance of her food and culinary efforts. These are basic, durable bowls, I know they aren't what Pyrex used to make, but for a novice chef or baker, these are perfect. They also take up little space since they nest and have a low profile. I have two of these bowls myself and I use them for all sorts of things, some food, some not. If you do not have glass mixing bowls, get these, you will like them."
"Greattttt beautiful came safely my mom loves it the only thing about is i thought it was going to be bigger , but it was smaller than expected i took a pic of the bowls with a finished bounty napkin roler to show the size of it so ya guys can go to finished napkin roler and see if ya like the size lol , but anyways that didnt matter , its really nice nice for 10 dollars for 3 glass of bowls. thank youu."
"When you go to buy these, you might look for glass mixing bowls. Well, you found them. I am giving these bowls 5 stars which covers perceived build quality, packaging, and sturdiness. There are zero bubbles in these bowls, came with no cracks, and the manufacturers box was great. The box Amazon shipped it in was far too large, so the parent box got squished, but the box my bowls were in ended up fine. I dropped one of these bad boys on my foot last night (small one, thankfully), and it then bounced off the laminate flooring. The bowl is just fine. I think these bowls will be around for a while, especially if I can stop dropping things."
"Not so big on processed foods in this household so cooking and baking are daily occurrences. Sure, the 10 piece nesting bowl sets are kinda cool, though they always feel a little fragile and the lips of them inevitably chip a bit over time. I left my old set of nesting non-Pyrex bowls at a rental and came back to Pyrex when I needed to replace them.  I paired the 3-piece set with the 10-ounce custard cups (for prep and leftovers) and 4 quart mixing bowl. For me, that’s enough for prep, etc. Dishwashers can be rough on glass. I generally hand wash mixing bowls unless I working with meats, fish, etc.  These are heavy, durable bowls with thick lips that resist chipping very well. ‘nuff said. If I break one I will replace it with another Pyrex bowl. Period."
"I am happy with this purchase. For a competitive price (more competitive than any I've seen in retail stores), you'd get a set of 3 microwave-safe glass bowels, well packaged during shipping. I often use the smallest one for melting butter & mixing dipping sauce, the medium for mixing batters & quiche filling, and the largest as a salad bowl. Having used them frequently for a while, I haven't had any noticeable problem with any of the 3. Given their competitive price, I'd say they are worthy of the value and have great use."
"I purchased a set of pyrex bowls 20 years ago. The largest one broke a few years ago when it fell out of the car on the holidays. The medium one broke a few weeks back when a cast iron pan was dropped on it.  Overall these are the workhorses of the kitchen bowls. They get used as the upper portion of double boilers for making custard, curds, chocolate work, etc. They are used for microwaving everything. Butter, sugar, water... whatever. They are durable, stack nicely together and are a must have for anyone who cooks anything."
"Great set of bowls every kitchen should have. These are the standard. Very versatile, microwave and dishwasher safe. Stain proof, heavy duty, and does well with heat. We use them for everything from heating foods in the microwave, to mixing cake batter, or even serving chips, salads, or dinner sides. They stack well, and we have purchased 2 sets worth and all 6 bowls fit together on one cabinet shelf together. The sizes are nice for most jobs."
"I am buying and using only glass bowls-containers switchn out all plastic containers bowl and replacing with glass product. The price was very affordable; they arrived unscratched, flawless but no lids? That's why they were so affordable.  I saw lids being sold separately. When I can afford to buy lids I will. The glass bowls are each a decent size. Great for singles & small 2-4sized families. They look so nice nestled together I simply leave them in the middle of the dining table. I usually take photos but these have convincingly adequate photos.  Very helpful with my positive choosing. The photos are true to form."
"Pyrex says it all. I really enjoy these and can't honestly understand why I waited so long to buy a set. They are the perfect size for two people. I will never need any bowl larger than the biggest one in this set. And the smallest one is deceiving. It is larger than I thought it would be. I also love the stackability of them. I placed a folded paper towel between the bowls to keep them from scratching, though I doubt that they would. And the lip around each bowl helps my arthritic hands grasp and hold on to each bowl to scrape out the contents of the bowl into another container, like a baking pan. I highly recommend these to any single person or twosome."
"Solid, quality Pyrex bowl set. Each size comes in handy. I like the extra edge lip when wrapping plastic food wrap (it clings and wraps around it very well). I use them for everything as I try to stay away from anything plastic when cooking. I've mixed cake batter and whipped mayonnaise like stuff (caviar spread for example) with the mixer using the metal beaters and it all worked out well. The bottom is nicely rounded so mixing anything is easy. Overall great set and a must-have for any kitchen."
"High quality glass bowls. I've purchased bargain glass bowls through the years. Should not have wasted my money. My mother had Pyrex of various kinds that held up for decades. (Someone, somewhere is probably still using them.) Worth making the investment. I bought them for a no-knead bread recipe that calls for baking it in a 1-quart Pyrex bowl. I could not find just the single bowl, so bought the set. Glad I did. I'll make use of all three sizes. Highly recommended."
"I desperately needed mixing bowls. In the past I'd had plastic ones, but I always love the look of glass- so this time I bought glass. I'm so happy I did. This set is just perfect. I love baking, but never bake huge batches of things. These three bowls are just the right size for a family of 4 to 6. It includes a 1 quart, 1 1/2 quart, and 2 1/2 quart bowl. Each of the bowls have a flat heavy bottom that keeps them from easily tipping over and about a 1/4 inch ridge around the edge which helps you grip the bowls and move them around (even with butter fingers).  These bowls are kind of heavy. Not as easy to move around as plastic ones, but they also don't tip over as easily. I prefer the fact they don't tip over as easily. Keeps messes to a minimum- even with kids helping you cook. These are made of very thick glass. We've dropped them a few times- they've never cracked, never chipped, never broke. They're fantastic. They are also microwavable safe. We don't have a dishwasher so I can't review that aspect- but they do claim to be dishwasher safe as well.  The bowls fit nicely within each other so they store flawlessly. They look nice even when they're not being used. We store them on a kitchen shelf and they look pretty with the rest of the cookware. They clean very easily. The smooth surface can pretty much be wiped out with a paper towel and shines perfectly. Even after months of use they still sparkle like they're brand new! No scratches or permanent marks.  The smaller bowl is great for mixing seasonings, beating eggs, mixing wet ingredients, and small servings at the dinner table (things like gravy, fresh fruit, or steamed veggies).  The medium bowl is perfect for storing eggs in the refrigerator (fits 18 nicely inside), mixing dry ingredients, serving sides at the dinner table (mashed potatoes, casseroles, macaroni and cheese).  The large bowl is just the right size for mixing baking ingredients (cake, cookies, pie crust), serving large portions of meals, serving popcorn at a family movie night, and storing fresh fruit in the refrigerator.  All together this set covers most of my baking and cooking needs. They're a great set to keep on hand- although I think I could use two of them during bigger family events and holidays. I love the look. I love the heavy-weight aspect. I love how easy they are to store. And I love how the different sizes are ideal for the things I need to use mixing bowls for!"
"I gave these as a gift to someone who had other mixing bowls over the years. She is excited because pyrex can go in an oven, a freezer, or a nicrowave. She praised their versitility. Based on my experience of happily having my set for almost 50 years and her new found satisfaction with the pyrex set, I would say give these as a gift to someone else or yourself."
"I started making food everyday since 2015. I bought this set at a lovely price of $12. I think I got an extra large one from someone and they nest together like they belong together. As I said I cook everyday and bake often. Till this day they remain sturdy despite daily wearing and occasional dropping--I was surprised every time when I drop one of the bowls and they didn't even chip a little big. Now, I have to say that there are scratch marks on the bottom of the bowls now from all the beating and whipping I did when I made some one hundred cakes during the course of 3 months, but you get the idea that they are heavily used. Love them"
"I’ve had these bowls for a while and really appreciate how sturdy and heavy they are. I typically put a damp towel underneath my mixing bowls to make sure they don’t move while I’m mixing something, but I don’t feel like I need to do that with these bowls unless I’m working very aggressively.  Their weight and sturdiness keep them in place, and they don’t move around at all when I’m doing something simple, like whisking together dry ingredients or folding a batter.  They also work well on food scales, leaving me able to easily read the scale. I’m also not nervous about the bowls being TOO heavy to safely put on my food scale, which I’m glad about.  I would definitely buy another set of these, especially since they nest so well for storage!"
"Let me just start of with “wow”. This is 3 bowls. Perfect for things bowls are known for. I wonder why the call bowling “bowling”, because it has nothing to do with bowls at all. But this product, it doesn’t lie to you, it’s just 3 bowls, and that’s exactly what I needed. Thanks bowl seller."
"I bought these mixing bowls for the purpose of making peasant bread, and they work really well for that. From a batch of dough I’m able to bake two small loaves using the 1 and 1.5 qt bowls, or one larger loaf using the 2.5 qt bowl. When I make two small loaves, I use the 2.5 qt as the mixing bowl.  I also use the bowls as serving dishes, both hot and cold foods (snacks, fruit, dips, salads, other vegetables, small casseroles - yes, casserole in a bowl!). It’s nice to be able to go from oven or fridge to table in the same dish. They are attractive and sturdy, and being clear glass means you can really see the food - which I like.  Keep in mind these are not huge mixing bowls. The 2 qt is the most practical as far as a mixing bowl for baking in small batches - peasant bread, cake mix, cookies, muffins, etc. The smaller bowls can be used to mix dips or small salads, just be sure not to overfill. They nest perfectly, which makes storage easy. Also easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. This is a great product at a great price!"
"Fabulous mixing bowls! Three nice sizes for different uses. I have just re-discovered Baking, and these bowls are a must. One important feature is that they ""spin"" I have some rubber-maid bowls with rubber on the bottom - the rubber keeps the bowls sturdy when you mix, a nice feature. But with many recipes, especially meringue, you need to spin the bowl as you mix. Nice feature number TWO you can see through them, if you are waiting for something to rise, or wonder what you left in the fridge. And nice feature THREE they look very nice on your serving table as well as your counter top. Nice feature FOUR they hold Cling Wrap very well. And nice feature FIVE they clean up really well. (I bought a second set :) Rubber-maid and Stainless Steel have their uses, but Pyrex Glass is essential."
"Great set of easy to clean mixing bowls. Cooking and baking has become so easy with these bowls, as they make it possible to prepare multiple ingredients at once without having to clean and reuse a single bowl in the middle of cooking/baking. The varied sizes are also great for different recipes, and it’s easy to store these in the fridge. They stack for easy storage as well. They have shown no signs of wear after use or placing them in the dishwasher."
"When arthritis invaded my hands my beautiful heavy ceramic bowls found a permanent place on the shelf. I was looking for a sturdy set of bowls that were versatile. I needed to mix, serve and microwave these bowls and Pyrex came to the rescue. A seven layer salad looks great. When I make brownies I can actually lift and scrape my bowl pain free. Thank You Pyrex!"
"I love these for when I bake, they are sturdy and easy to clean. I would not say that they are very light, but they are good quality!"
"I like quiet elegance in my life, nothing that jumps out at you. Pyrex has been making these bowls for decades and they last a long, long time. These are simply designed, not too deep, but deep enough for most usages. They can be used for food prep as well as serving. They can be dressed up as a formal serving dish or wrapped with leftovers in the refrigerator. They are dishwasher safe and one bowl nests into the other for saving storage space."
"I am a professional baker and have been through a number of different glass bowls and have found that Pyrex is the superior brand in terms of sturdiness. Other bowls have literally cracked under pressure but Pyrex has never disappointed me. I have used the bowls for prepping and mixing, poured hot brown butter in them, and put them over a bain marie. They held up nicely in every situation. I promise I don't work for them or anything, I'm just a really big fan."
"I was concerned with some of the reviews on here from people complaining about the product not being up to ""Pyrex"" standards, and that they broke when they dropped them on a hard floor... (That one baffles me, I typically avoid dropping large glass objects on the hardwood floors in my kitchen, but that's just me.) They were packaged very well considering they are made of glass, arrived promptly and intact... I used the bowls the day I received them as I also purchased a deep fryer from Amazon two days prior, so I used the bowls to prepare fried chicken. The sizes are absolutely perfect, making it easy to have one for batter, one for breading, etc... And as far as their design, I would say they are perfect! They're very durable feeling, however they are not so thick that they are cumbersome to use, which has been a complaint of mine in the past. And with the design in mind, I wouldn't be opposed or worried to use them as serving bowls in a pinch either. In summary, durable, attractive, easy to clean, and great size."
"Fantastic product. I needed mixing bowls and these are great. I love the rim that runs around the top. With some bowls, there is no rim, and with others there are two handles on the top. The rim on these bowls serves as a handle, so you can easily and safely grab the top at any point. You don’t have to turn the bowl around to find the handles."
"These are great bowls, They were exactly what I wanted, I use them to mix everything every day. They are easy to wash and well-made. The packaging was very sturdy and had no problems at all. Great seller with a great product."
"I bought these because for the longest time I only had 1 plastic mixing bowl that was not rounded. It did and still does a fine job but for recipes that call for mixing dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls I figured it was time to stop using my dinnerware. So far I have been happy with these. There is one very tiny imperfection on the bottom of one of the bowl, but since it was itty bitty and not on the inside I let it slide. They are super easy to clean after use and have held up pretty well. Overall would recommend."
"Perfect for prep when I'm baking or cooking! The fact that their nesting is really nice, saves a lot of space. Clean up is super easy since they're dishwasher safe . Even handwashing from time to time is pretty easy since it's glass. I'd recommend putting a paper towel in between the bowls when storing them so they don't get scratched up. 10/10"
"Have used Pyrex most of my life, mostly ovenware though. Needed new bowls and wanted to change to glass. First set arrived with flaws/cracks. They were very fast to ship out replacement, which was good to go! Heavy duty, very nice."
"I like that they are really thick and most importantly microwave safe. I have so many stainless steel bowls and every time I need to microwave something I thought about buying some. So glad I did so I didn't have to use a my dishes. I think they are fairly priced, and have maintained the same quality over the years, instead of making cheaper versions."
"Yes, those scratches one sees in their plastic mixing bowls reflect material that is deteriorating. I decided it was time to replace my well-used bowls with glass. Having three different sizes makes food prep decisions easy. And, being glass, these can go on the bottom rack of the dishwasher. To protect the glass when stacking them, I use a paper towel between each bowl. Love them!"
"I bought these to replace on medium sized one, of at least 30 years, that I chipped. The price was good to get three, fo the price of many I saw that were only one. I'm very pleased with what i received. The different sizes are very useful."
"I bought this set to replace the 1.5 quart size, which I accidentally dropped on our kitchen floor. Before that, I'd had a similar set (but with four bowls) of Pyrex for twenty-three years; we got it as a wedding gift, and I've gotten so much use out of it! I use the 1.5 quart size every day to make my steel-cut oats in the microwave, and the other bowls are in constant rotation. They clean up easily, microwave well, and are sturdy and heavy. Pyrex is my go-to for quality products!"
"I dropped my favorite ceramic mixing bowl and was looking for a replacement. I had a small Pyrex bowl that I was happy with so decided to try buying the larger bowls. I love these bowls, the combination is sizes are perfect for mixing and storage. They are easy to hold, not too heavy, and are easy to wash after use. Now I can't figure how I managed without them as I use at least one of them almost every day."
"After looking at multiple bowls with mixed reviews, I decided on these Pyrex bowls. Sometimes it is worth buying the brand-name. They don’t have lids but I don’t care, I have plenty of other things I can use. These nest well and are heavy duty. I only wish that they had one more very large bowl in the set."
"I like making homemade whipped cream. After getting this mixing bowl set, the task became so much easier. I use different bowls based on how much I want to make each time. The bowls are sturdy enough to stay on the counter, so I don't need to worry about the bowl moving around while I whisk. Also, the glass material is thick enough to keep the cream cold on a warm day. The bows are easy to clean. I could see myself using them for a long time."
"i really enjoyed the no extra frills packaging that made it so easy to take the bowls out. they were safe and protected, no damage or use at all. washed great in the dishwasher and are pyrex brand, so they are sturdy and solid glass."
"Very sturdy mixing bowl set. They're easy to clean and love glass so while microwaving, I can see when to remove my contents of the bowl."
"Bought these mostly for baking bread in the small bowl but love having shiny new glass bowls. Might be my imagination but they don’t seem quite as heavy as my last (my grandmother’s very, very old, painted, and chipped, and missing the smallest bowl ) set. Definitely a plus for me rather than a negative. I bought a stainless set last year because I was tired of picking up a stack of heavy glass, but I find myself using these more."
"I was able to get a very good deal for this set, happy I did. At the time it was less than the cost of one bowl by itself. These nest perfectly with my vintage set, dimensions almost identical."
"The edges around the bowls are flat and the glass bowls itself are very heavy. I bought these for baking and mixing and they were able to do exactly that. I haven’t had any trouble removing stuff, the sponges I used are anti-scratch, and I haven’t really tried or accidentally dropped any of the bowls so I’m not too sure about it’s durability."
These bowls are great! I use them almost everyday. They're dishwasher safe and easy to put away. The largest bowl seems more of a medium size compared to other brands but still gets most jobs done. No regrets here.
"These bowls are the right size to mix cake/brownie mixes or whip an egg in the smaller one. I made a pea salad in the large one and it held the ingredients nicely. They are made of heavy, thick glass. I really like them and would highly recommend them for purchase."
"Obviously Pyrex is known for quality and sturdiness but man, these things are the best. I feel like you could throw them at a brick wall and they wouldn't chip. The sizes are exactly what I need and I find myself using them for everything and neglecting the rest of my dishes."
"I use these bowls everyday. They are sturdy--exactly what you'd expect form this manufacturer. I prep, mix and serve in these bowls--and I love that I can make a side dish ahead of time leave it in the bowl ready to be served , and just pop it into my oven warmer while I get the main entree done. They really are quite perfect."
"Like the title says great set of Pyrex mixing bowls for the money, I just broke our big mixing bowl last week and I promised the wife I would buy her another. After seeing three in this set I was all over it, they shipped out very quickly and being part of Amazon Prime I expected it too. Bowls are typical Pyrex quality, dishwasher safe, microwave safe, and freezer safe. My only complaint is I thought the big one was the same size at the one I broke, l later found out in actual fact I broke a 4.0 quart mixing bowl, so my wife got a bargain and got this set plus I still have to buy her the bigger bowl, unfortunately I can find the bigger bowl online someplace else, and that makes me sad because I believe Amazon ""Usually"" has the cheapest prices around. Not this time Amazon."
"We absolutely love these! They are a great size, and they have a good weight to them. They clean out easily, which is a huge improvement over my last mixing bowls. We only use these for mixing, so we haven't run into any issues with taking them from one extreme temperature to another. I do think its worth noting though that it warns you not to do that right in the booklet that comes with the bowls. Clear as day, first page. We'll probably end up buying more and completely replacing our mixing bowls with these."
"These bowls are great. They are very sturdy. The glass is thick. They came in perfect condition I use them to mix my famous cookies (that overwhelm my usual mixing bowls) in the biggest one and and it holds all the ingredients well. I have also used them to temper chocolate in to make chocolate covered strawberries, and it’s so much easier than the microwaving method. These bowls are a great investment to a bakers kitchen and I’m very satisfied with this purchase"
"Arrived in perfect condition, thanks to great packaging. Love these bowls. Since they didn't come with lids, I did find lids to fit perfectly which I ordered a few days after receiving. Good quality, like the sizes, nice thickness, they should last for many years. Great seller. Satisfied customer"
"I bought these a little less then a year ago because I wanted some mixing bowls for when I am making burgers, eggs, French toast etc. and figured these would be nice for the price. I remembered them being closer to $20 so I am surprised to see them on such a good sale today. They arent the biggest mixing bowls but the glass quality is really nice and thick. I am rebuying cause my boyfriend and I split and I decided to let him keep the old set while I rebuy. I hope the new set is the same quality but I will be sure to update my review either way."
"Utilitarian products, like glass mixing bowls, tin foil and foot pedal trash cans, are a fact of life that we usually take for granted...until we don't have them. Hooray for great unsung products like these clear shatter resistant, microwave-safe nesting bowls. They make life easier. They're 3 useful sizes. They stack inside each other. Simple, effective, and ever so useful. Thanks!!"
"What can I say about Pyrex? Sturdy is their trademark. These are a great size. I use the biggest one for making Oatmeal for three adults in the microwave. Perfect size. Clean up is easy and since the nest inside each other, storage is easy, too."
These are exactly what I was looking for - they are deep enough and they have a lip. I use the smaller two for cooking - and the largest one goes to my parrot who LOVES to take a bath in a bowl of water. This bowl has a nice lip on it so Chester can stand on it while he dunks his top half into the bowl. And I love the lip for ease of handling while mixing ingredients. The price is right and they are a joy to work with.
I love this set of Pyrex glass mixing bowls. I purchased this item to replace my 1970's Pyrex bowls (I have one remaining). They are easy to hold for anyone who is experiencing mild arthritis in the hands. Only wish that I could find matching glass lids. I would recommend this to everyone.
"Loved these Pyrex bowls! They were easy to clean as well as affordable. Moreover, they arrived in a reasonable amount of time and packaged where they were protected from being damaged while transported. I would definitely recommend this product and the store from which it came."
"I needed some extra mixing and serving bowls. Decided on these clear ones since they go with everything. I thought the bowls would be a little larger in size, but I should have paid more attention when I ordered them. Seem to be durable and very easy to handle. Also like that they are microwavable safe."
"Beautiful old reliable bowls. Nice weight, but not too heavy. I got snobby and tossed my older Pyrex bowls for a more gourmet looking set. Big mistake. These guys are tough, the new fancy bowls went into the trash after a few uses as they chipped easily, were very heavy and not comfortable when pouring cake batter out. Also I missed the smooth Pyrex rounded bottoms. We are professional cake bakers. Good bowls are vital to us. The color of the newer Pyrex is clear white, but with a pretty green glass tint."
"Pyrex is the best and these mixing bowls are a must have in any kitchen, but especially if you’re a baker! If the fact that they’re glass worries you, it shouldn’t, it is thick durable glass and Pyrex glass is known for its ability to go from hot to cold or cold to hot without cracking. The simplicity of these bowls also makes them great for serving a beautiful salad or other eye catching dish!"
"Good bowls, good quality. A little smaller than I thought they’d be but still good for the purpose I bought them for. There is a set with lids that is not much more expensive, and I wish I’d bought those. They’d be much more useful."
"I like the sizes and I really like the flange on the rim of the bowl. The two larger bowls fit nicely in the Staybowlizer that I just bought from Amazon. Pyrex bowls can go in the oven and microwave. They should not go on the stove top or broiler. A double boiler as the topmost vessel is also okay. As a patriot and Navy veteran, I love to see Made in the USA."
"My husband broke one of my constantly used yellow plastic bowls and I really missed it! So to Amazon I went, looking for more. Couldn't find them! So I looked again, measured to make sure what size I needed - and kept coming back to these bowls. Besides being available in exactly the size I was looking for (24 oz.), I liked their appearance. Each time we want to microwave something, we have to drag out another paper plate or bowl. But . . . you CAN microwave in these bowls! There is nothing ""hazardous"" in the bowls. And they can be popped into the dishwasher. And!!! They are not breakable. Okay . . . what's not to like about them?! Good-looking, deep, microwaveable, dishwasher safe, unbreakable, nothing hazardous in them, reasonably priced, light-weight and nice, warm colors. It's a win-win several times over!"
"We've been looking for bowls that are unbreakable but not plastic. We researched and found this one, made of wheat straw. So happy with our purchase."
"These bowls are a great color, very durable and easy to clean. I have cheap dollar General plastic bowls that are stained from pasta sauces but these have resisted the stain! My kids have eaten greasy foods that most plastics would be hard getting that ""film"" cleaned.. These? No problem! I absolutely love this item! So much so I bought 2 sets AND matching plates!!!"
"Durable, wipe clean with a paper towel... you can microwave soup until it's molten lava and still pick up the bowl without burning your hands. My favorite everyday knock around bowls. There's nothing fancy about them (these are not the ""hey the pope finally showed up and he wants some cereal!"" bowls LOL). Everything else about them is amazing. Get you some."
"These bowls work great for microwaving any kind of food. They don't melt, burn or discolor when placed in a microwave oven. They are strong, light weight and unbreakable."
Perfect for the camper! Lightweight but durable. Microwave safe AND the dish not touching the food doesn’t get hot in the microwave! It’s the travel porcelain dish ware! Def recommend for fellow campers. Only drawback is it will stain if you microwave red sauce items.
"Never have noted bowel get hot from the microwave, it will get hot where the food is in contact with the bowel through conduction heat transfer. However, this bowel seems to be one of the best for not absorbing the microwaves and getting hot. Many 'Microwave Safe' containers may be microwave safe but often get pretty hot."
"These bowls are very lightweight, sturdy and unbreakable. My wife has a bad case of tremors and likes them because of being lighter than glass bowels and that they are unbreakable! They hold a large amount of cereal or soup for a hungry person. They are microwave usable along with being dishwasher save. We are very happy with this product."
"These bowls are great. They're just the right size for soup, salad, cereal, or anything else you may make for a meal. They're very easy to clean and the colors are light and pretty. They stack up nicely as well. The only drawback to the bowls is I've noticed some red sauce is difficult to get out of it similar to what you'd see in plastic storage containers."
Very durable and a nice size. They do stain if you heat colorful sauces in them like spaghetti sauce but other than that very sturdy and a good batgain.
"I bought the cups and plates recently which are great, so decided to complete the set. They are sturdy and don’t stain easily. I attribute them to Tupperware quality (well Tupperware of the 1980s)."
Perfect size for cereal. Sturdy and good looking. I bought these for my kids to use and provide peace of mind
Flashback to the 50s & 60s! My husband loves these colors---so retro! The colors are very soft but pleasing to the eye---really brightens up the table. Bowls are lightweight but very sturdy. Seem to hold up well in the dishwasher.  A great buy if you're looking for something different!
great as long as you just do not reheat food in them in the microwave
These bowls are very light but durable. They are in subdued colors but pretty and work well for whatever you put in them. The bowls are easy to clean and stack nicely. I definitely recommend them.
"These are exactly what I have been looking for! Pretty colors, microwaveable, right size, and easy to clean! We have been using entirely too many paper products and this is my answer! Thank you! I would totally recommend these unbreakable cereal bowls!"
"If you have broken many bowls in your time, you will love these. I was not sure at first until I received them. They clean easy and have not broken one at all. They are great in the microwave and in the dishwasher. I AM SO HAPPY I FOUND THESE AND LOVE THAT THEY CAN GO IN THE MICROWAVE AND DISHWASHER!"
I really like these!
I bought these bowls because my very inquisitive kitten kept getting onto the counter and flipped my other bowls to the floor.
My friend specifically asked for these and she has not had any complaints so far. It’s been about a year or 2 since I brought them.
I bought these to go in our camper because they were so much lighter than melamine and they are microwavable safe! I ran them thru a wash in my dishwasher before packing them and they came out beautifully!
"These are holding up very well in the dishwasher and microwave. One of the bowls did stain slightly from spaghetti sauce, but very lightly."
Wife bought me these for Xmas. Sounds weird but I use bowls a lot. These were pretty perfect. All eco friendly specs make it even better. Perfect size and feel. Another set she bought was flimsy. These are perfect.
"Love the colors, love them as cereal and ice cream bowls. Many grandchildren so always being used. Would buy more if needed."
Great bowls and not super expensive. Very good to use outdoors and very durable. You can use it to microwave food. The pastel color is very nice too.
We absolutely love the bowls! Do yourself a favor and order double and go ahead and get the plates as well!
Older couple we tend to drop bowels hands don’t work like they used to which leads to a broken mess has solved a big problem for us.
These bowls are a fantastic price. They are not quite as sturdy as I thought but they are plenty sturdy for just about anything. I think they are beautiful and I love them 😍.
"They aren’t as deep as I hoped but I would still recommend. I use a cane and need bowls that are easy to carry in one hand, these are perfect for me."
Lightweight and stain resistant! Love them
"Light but very sturdy, easy to clean and does not get damaged in the microwave."
I really like the bowls
Nice bowls great for cereal
They work great and are very easy to clean.
"These are microwave safe, light weight and are wonderful for our motor home. Dishwasher safe too! Our favorite bowls that go along with the same plates."
"Perfect size for my grandkids. I thought they would stain easily but they are very resistant to stains, so far!"
"These bowls are awesome, they old way more ice cream than they need to! lol they are very durable, easy to clean and dont get as hot in the microwave as my ceramic bowls do."
Best in class! True microwave wave bowls. I've mainly positioned them in the upper rack of the dishwasher but occasionally in the bottom and they look brand new after months of use!!
Well made and good for the microwave.
Love these bowls. My dog can even chew through these. Sturdy!
"I ordered these bowls because, well, I needed more bowls. I decided to give these a try because I am not a fan of plastic. These are incredible! They are deep and wide, incredibly easy to clean and dishwasher safe, and they hold onto heat after microwaving pretty darn good! I expected to get basic bowls, but instead I got some amazing bowls that I will absolutely be buying again."
It was good
"I appreciate that it is sustainably crafted from bamboo, but works perfectly in use. No issues in the microwave or dishwasher, an initial concern of mine."
Use for everything edibles
"Perfect for what we needed. Light-weight and sturdy, dishwasher safe and does not hold stains. Great price! Would definitely buy again"
"Love these bowls, they do seem to stain with red sauce, but do like them. Nice and large."
"These are great for soup, cereal, ice cream or whatever requires a bowl. They are very pretty colors too."
"My girls and I love these bowls. So lightweight and so pretty. Someone else said the bowls made food taste funny, but I didn’t find that at all."
"If they truly are green and made out of what they say, these bowls are amazing. So light, hard to believe they are made of wheat. Decent size bowls."
"I love the colors, durability and there are deep enough to use for ramen, cereal, spaghettti and soup"
Better than plastic. Good value
great little bowls
Perfect! Durable! They don’t stain!!! LOVE THESE BOWLS!!! I got the cups and smaller bows too! All awesome!
I bought these bowls for a camping weekend that I made chili for. They are so light and easy to pack! I loved them so much I use them for everyday now. They microwave fine and go through the dishwasher. I highly recommend these!
"Love these bowls- love the colors, the the size"
"Very good, sturdy bowls."
"Perfect for cereal, rice meals, soups, dessert too."
Great bowls. They are a perfect size. They are easy to clean and seem durable.
"Beautiful colors, durable, dishwasher safe"
"We love these bowls. They do not stain, are easy to clean and are light enough for the little ones to carry around. We have microwaved them with spaghetti sauce in them and there was no staining. You can't say that about microwave safe plastic."
I’ve had these for a year now - I use them every day! I also throw them in the microwave with no issue and run them through the dishwasher all the time. I love that they’re not made of plastic. They’re THE BEST!!
"Colorful, easy to clean. They are amazing."
These bowls are so easy to clean and very strong and durable. I love them
"I'd love to see other color options, but these bowls are really great and so much better than plastic!"
They are just the right size.
I like the size and how easy it gets cleaned in the dishwasher
Great size for cereal or soup. Easy to wash.
These are great bowls and don't get hot when you heat things in the microwave. Love the colors too.
These are great bowls and I used them every day
"These are great and exactly what I was looking for! Very sturdy especially for little ones, they don’t stain, microwave and dishwasher safe and better for the planet than traditional plastic bowls. Fantastic purchase!"
Using for cereeal and salads. Washing clean in dishwasher. Been using daily for about two months now and no problems! Great buy!
That's why I bought them!
Happy
Very durable
"I like the flat bottom, sturdy and washing well in dishwasher."
Wish I could have plates.
"Love the bowls and the size is perfect, but red sauce still stains no matter what I do."
Pretty good bowls.
"The bowls are sturdy, good in microwave and hold a good amount of food. The only thing is they do stain."
Cereal salads
Very pleased with the product
Dislike
"Excellent bowls made from a renewable source and they will last and last, that’s great for the environment. The colors are good and the bowls are very large. I like them so much I bought plates of the same material!"
"These are a really good sized bowl. But they have a good wide bottom so they won't tip over like every other wheatstraw bowl. Others were all designed as 'rice bowls' meant to be held in a hand when eating and are very tippy on a table. So these work great for soups and kids cereal bowls. Sturdy and durable. Best I could find in the 'bowl' category. Very pleased with them. A definite good buy. Only knock is they are on the large size for 'normal' use. But a full can of soup will easily fit in 1 bowl, so that can also be an advantage too."
"These bowls are my favorite! They're so durable, i use them to whisk eggs, or soup or salad or ice cream, everything...they're the perfect size for whatever and very easy to clean! love love love!"
"I don't know how (or why) I waited so long to buy these. The design is perfect and the notches at the top of the bowl to rest chopsticks is super convenient and makes eating Ramen and other dishes much easier and more enjoyable. The spoons that come with it are also the perfect shape/length to make getting soup and noodles and meat/vegetables all in the same bite very easy. Also, the company is great. I emailed them with a question and they responded almost immediately. I would recommend these bowls to anyone who makes ramen or other kinds of soups/dishes with which chopsticks are used."
"These are beautiful looking. Seem very sturdy. Looking forward to taking them along when we camp or roadtrip in our little motorhome. I bought 2 sets and loved them at first sight. After using them, I ordered another set of 2.  My meals have looked so incredible served in these bowls that it has actually inspired me to make healthy bowls part of my regular meal rotations. Cost me though. I've bought about 5 new ""bowl"" cookbooks since I got these."
"Wow, these Ramen bowls were a hit! I had a little dinner party recently, and since it was so cold outside, I wanted to make a great Short Rib Ramen recipe that my friends always ask me for. I was tired of serving my amazing Ramen recipe is simple bowls, so I decided to ""splurge"" and get the real bowls. The bowls looked great on the table, they were easy to clean and held a nice amount of Ramen and Broth. Great value for what you pay. I highly recommend."
I entertain with these pieces often. We enjoy the look as well as the sturdiness of the bowl set. I will order more.
"If you are a pho lover or soup lover in general then these bowls are a must add to your collection. Since you get 2 bowls I have 1 at work so I can get pho to go (great for the pandemic), then 1 bowl for home . Must have stop reading just buy it."
I use them a lot. They are very pretty and make all the soups look so much better
Love it! Feel like eating outside with this lovely bowls. Good to buy under pandemic especially u like to cook. Great noodle bowl :)
It makes a special dinner to use the whole set
"Great size. I use this regularly and it is great and super easy to clean. I haven’t dropped it as of yet, so I cannot comment on the durability. Overall a very good bowl for ramen."
I use these almost daily for my dinner. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about them.
I enjoyed eating pho and ramen in this. It's what I was thinking of getting for awhile. It will due for now.
These are perfect fit a big bowl of ramen on a cold night and super easy to clean. I love these more than my last ones because they are a lot deeper and supper cute
These are neat and the wife loves it
I really liked this set. The bowl is large with perfect placement for your chop sticks. Also the additional dish for sauce for egg roll or small cucumber salad is a nice addition. I've already used it several times and it is easy to clean too!
"These ramen bowls are the perfect size for me. Big enough for a good size bowl of hot noodles, broth and toppings. 😊GKlein"
Very nice looking set! Can't wait to use it!
Sturdy and easy to clean. Highly recommend if u done have a ramen bowl set
Excellent just the way he described it chopsticks spoon beautiful actually worth the money worth to buy would buy it again would recommend to friends
Definitely a great starter set
Nice sturdy large bowls. Cleans up easy. Perfect! Not cheap!
"Title makes it seems like it's unbreakable ""ceramic"" bowl...when it's PLASTIC."
I loved the way they feel and how sturdy they are.
Everything looked amazing till I lifted the bowls and saw a broken chopstick. My heart broke 💔😢
"Thought they weren't plastic but I was wrong. I like the concept for the indentations where you can rest your chopsticks but not at all what I was expecting. After washing them for the first time, there was a weird veneer that appeared that was easily scratched off."
There were fingerprints on the bowls
"These bowls are plastic, so if you are looking for glass ramen bowls there are not for you. But I find them to be the perfect size for a large bowl of ramen! The indents for your chopsticks are very convenient! And I love the giant broth spoons. They made it super easy to scoop up some soup, pile some noodles on there and have a delicious bite :) Highly recommend this set!"
My girlfriend and I eat ramen quite often so I decided to get some dish ware made for that. The items are very nice and look as advertised. They are very sturdy while not being heavy. Very easy to clean and come with a nice little storage bag.
"Good thing these bowls are unbreakable, the package got thrown at my door and not a single piece is broken! This set is very pretty and clean looking"
"Haven’t used them yet but I can’t wait. I love that they’re deep, I don’t love that plastic feel, it is a little cheap feeling, but on the cheap, it’s great! I love that it comes with the spoon as well!"
These are perfect for our homemade ramen. Great quality and easy to clean!
We have used them ten times.
They are prefect.
Please do yourself a favor
ok
"I have been searching for a good size ramen bowl set and came upon these. These bowls are designed beautifully. The slot where the chopsticks rest on is a genius idea! The spoons are big and long enough where it doesn’t fall into your soup bowl.  It is lightweight for such a good size bowl but still feels sturdy. I had accidentally dropped it once and didn’t even get a scratch in them! I have not used these just for ramen but most of my dinner! It’s been my to-go bowl for salads, other soup/noodle dishes, pasta, sushi rice bowls. They are also really easy to clean. I am thinking of buying another set to gift to a friend as a house warming gift. Definitely would recommend getting these!"
sent with all broken chopsticks :(
"I now have 4 sets of bowls, all different materials, and these are the first that stand up to both a dishwasher and the microwave. Most assume that any plastic is microwave safe but after heating up and splitting the last set I purchased I really needed something that would heat the food and not the bowl. These work great. They are not super thick or hard. There is some give to them that others have called flimsy but they maintain their shape and are light weight. This was a good purchase."
"I love these. The first thing I did was purposely drop everyone of these on the floor. Yes. I’m that person. They bounced and held together. They are tough but not heavy as one might think. They are thicker than a typical plastic which I appreciate. Gives the bowls a “nicer” feel. They are casual but still aesthetically pleasing. The only thing that I could complain about is there are two matching greys. So the graduation from darker blue to grey has an individual color per transition till you get to the grey which is two bowls. Not a big deal but I’m an artist and I would love them all to be different. Still, they are lovely and so far my kids haven’t destroyed them."
"These spend a lot of time outside, and so far, I've only lost one due to the heat and pressure changes in MI weather. They are a perfect size for Cereal, or other such eating. Inexpensive, durable, and great quality"
"We were looking for bowls to replace using paper bowls to stop wasting money. These turned out great. They are super easy to clean and they don’t get crazy hot in the microwave. We stopped using all paper products after getting these. Highly, highly recommend these."
"We have 2 young boys that somehow manage to break regular bowls on a regular basis. These are a great alternative as they are lightweight, don't chip or break, and are easy to clean. Also as far as I can tell there is no concern about chemicals in the material as they are made of wheat somehow."
I bought these for the RV because they were light weight and easy to clean plus they don’t rattle around! These are safe for microwave and dishwasher. After using in RV I bought some for our home use too. Highly recommend!
Needed some deep small plastic bowls for salad or cereal but did not want plastic or ceramic. These are great and fit the bill nicely. Everybody uses these first in the house I'll have to order another set.
These bowls are the right size when you want a little larger helping of cereal or soup. Good quality and they aren’t hot to the touch when you put hot soup in them. Totally satisfied with my purchase.
I really like these bowls. They ate a good size for cearel or oatmeal and heating stuff in microwave. They are durable and sturdy. They are easy to clean. They stack nice to fit into the cupboard.
"These bowls are lovely, durable and very lightweight. They are the perfect size for cereal or soup. The colors are all soft blue tones. I have used them in both the dishwasher and the microwave with success. Great dishes."
Perfect for salads and ice cream. Easy to clean.
The bowls are dishwasher and microwave safe. They will not break if they are dropped. They are also deep to help eliminate spills.
"Sturdy, looks great after placing on Top shelf dishwasher & heats up soup without sticking to the sides! Nice depth-less likely to spill liquid such as milk or soup. Holds more than I expected!"
Love the colors and the performance. Used them to microwave .
"I bought these because, for some reason, I e had trouble finding plastic-ware in stores. Passed my dishwasher & microwave tests. Kid approved!"
"I would have like to order all of them in one of the colors instead of a selection, but it works. They are light, but durable."
These bowls are so light weight very easy to clean they appear to be small but really can hold a lot inside of them they are vibrant in color they are exactly what you see in the photos.
"Just what we were looking for! Lightweight and holds a decent amount of cereal without spilling milk. As any plastic dishes, I'd imagine they stain with tomato, but we have ceramic dishes for that. Holds up in the dishwasher too."
"The kids haven't managed to break, crack or stain them yet so I am calling it a win. They are working as advertised and were a good price."
I love these bowls we use it for warm or cold meals. Easy to clean and durable
"Love these bowls. They're perfect for soup, ice cream, just about anything. Dishwasher safe and they stay just like new, plus they don't stain."
We needed some dessert/cereal bowls. These are perfect. Microwave and dish washer safe. Great value.
"Exactly what I needed as far as size, microwavable and dish washer safe. This was the second set I ordered, because I liked the first set so much."
Great replacement from the bowls I previously had.
Have a nice texture nice colors good size most important unbreakable but not cheap looking
A good size; stackable in the cabinet and dishwasher; attractive and light weight.
Colors are boring but other than that they fill our needs.
Love these bowls. Great for any use & easy to clean. Perfect size.
Love these - wish they made bigger ones for when I eat larger salads or Pho soup
Perfect for the amount of cereal I like
"These bowls are very great. They have a smooth finish inside and then a matte ish finish outside. They look really good, and they’re great as some first bowls for a college dorm."
"Love these, their pretty, light, bit not thin and great size for what ever you are eating!"
Idk I like them alot. Cheap or not their bowls and they work as intended so no complaints here
I like that they are very easy to clean after using them and also excellent to use for cereal.
They're so cute and have lasted for 8 months in the dishwasher and microwave!
These were shipped to my son and he told me there great and easy to clean.
They don't break. Hold alot of food and clean up is rasy
The colors are lovely and I like that they are lightweight.
Liked everything about them.
The bowls don’t stain and unbreakable
Very good item
The bowls were even better than I expected. They’re almond st like real chinaware. They’re versatile and pretty too.
"Love the colors, great for fruit and snacks for kids – very easy to clean"
"Work’s great, no issues."
Like
They work for me.
A friend suggested these. We have absolutely loved them!!
We love our new bowls they are perfect size for cereal or soup
"Glad I made the choice to get them, I love them. They’re just the right size and look great."
Fantastic bowl. We use them for everything. Especially cereal. Deeper than they look. Durable and microwave safe.
"Very light, come out fine from the dishwasher. I use them for breakfast most of the time, but I have used them for spaghetti and the bowls never got to hot to handle."
"Received my bowls, the colors are very pretty. Already been washed in dishwasher and used by family. They are so deep, NO SPILL'S!"
"The bowls are exactly like shown in the picture. Pretty colors, light weight, love them!"
Love this bowls does not stain in the microwave
Bowls are great to have for the clumsy dish washers who want to avoid breaking more dishes with out having to stick to kid like plastic bowls. Definitely love the simple yet eye catching design.
"We liked them so well, we ordered a second set!"
Good product
Items purchased were as indicated
Love everything size and color.
These bowls make great cereal bowls!
Colors are great!
These bowls are great. They are very durable.
Perfect for cereal
Love these things!
Great size and very durable. Love the colors!
Perfect size—incredibly durable
Nice bowl dermal and use with the grandkids.
"The color palette of the bowls is very similar to my home, which i love!"
Pleasantly surprised by excellent quality! Highky recommend.
Would buy again!
"I bought a package of these bc my cat needed a wider open disposal bowl. He’s partially blind & nudges bowl until he has his face right in the bowl. I also use these to feed an outside cat. One night it rained & next morning w/water in bowl, it held up like a charm, which I figured there would be a mess if cat didn’t eat it all. I use disposable bowls bc I live in a tiny house & do not like to see dishes pile up from the day (cat eats twice a day) & I want to ensure a CLEAN bowl every other day. These are expensive BUT if you compare w/Glad disposable pet bowls, it’s a better value per bowl with a wider opening & wider on the bottom. It serves my purpose & keeps my cat from totally knocking over an entire bowl @ every feeding & it’s sanitary which is crucial for his eyes. BTW it definitely holds up to soups/stews (not plastic & flimsy). Hope this helps."
"We have been buying the Chinet divided plates for decades and the cost kept going up. I decided to try these and we recently used them for a party. They held up well with sandwiches, meatballs, fruit, veggies and dip. These plates were less expensive, so I think we found a winner!"
"T hese are sturdy, but light, and as far as I can tell, leakprook. I was surprised at the thickness ( a good thing), and am well satisfied with this product. I used one this morning for fried eggs and was delighted at how well the plate uoheld. This is a really good procust at a really good price."
"I could not be more pleased with a product, than I am with this one. They are sturdy, strong and hold the heat for soups and the cold for things like cereal. I am not only going to purchase these bowls again, but I will be purchasing the next size larger and the paper plates as soon as I run out of what I currently have."
"I bought the square 10"" prior to these and for a baby shower I hosted bought the circle version with dividers. We served banana leaf tamales, beef stew, chile rellenos, rice, and beans at this party and the plates handled it all. Most people reused their plates for seconds so durability is for sure a great selling point. No need to worry about it getting soggy and flimsy with usage or about cutting through the plate with disposable utensils. I haven't had the opportunity to test what a real knife would do when being used with this plate. For sure it holds up in that microwave we had some guests that served a full plate and microwaved the food for 2-3 minutes and it there was no concern about the plate getting wet from the steam or the plate losing integrity."
"So we've been doing a social brunch at my church every month for the last 6 months, and for me, the gold standard has always been Chinet's 8.75 inch white paper plate. Strong and sturdy, how can you go wrong? Decided to try these plates when my Chinet vendor couldn't supply on time, and received many positive comments on them, claiming them to be superior. It doesn't hurt that these plates are significantly less expensive - depending on your vendor, up to half the cost. Will be buying them again for the foreseeable future."
"A bit pricey in my opinion but I always try to buy compostable products when I need utensils and paper goods. I was actually sent the wrong item though. I ordered the 3 compartment but recieved the one with no compartments. Thankfully though they were the same price so I didn't lose any money but I would have liked to recieved what I actually ordered. All on all, good product. Very sturdy and holds a ton of food! Would recommend."
"I'd prefer these to be bigger in that the plate portion is less than the 9"" because of the defined rim. Otherwise, these have held potato salad, coleslaw and precooked microwaved frozen burgers with no problems (not all at the same time until served). They have to look and feel of sturdy paper plates but hold up better. I'll look for the 10 1/2"" next time."
These work very well for me. They are thick enough to put into the microwave and I haven't had any problems with sauce or other liquid seeping through. It's my second order of the same plates.
Very well made - I would definitely buy from these guys again
"Had a backyard bbq where most people Grab food and stand around. No need to double up on these plates. Hold a hot dog, hamburger, macaroni salad, slaw, and potato salad without fear when standing and walking around. Super Durable."
Disposable paper bowls that are very sturdy and disposable. No dishes to wash.
Awesome value they are extremely heavy duty and strong they don’t break and leak like Dixie paper plates awesome paper plates go and buy it today
Sometimes you just don't want to do dishes. I want to make sure I try to be safe for the environment. I like these better than regular paper plates any ways.
I like the product. These are very sturdy plates. Easy to use indoor and outdoor. Better quality vs some plates I brought from Costco. Pricing is also good. Size seems bit smaller then I thought but would like to order one more pack of bigger size.
"They arrived quickly and were very sturdy. These are the best environmentally friendly product, which is a concern in my purchase. Great salad bowls"
"They both are sturdy & leak proof. They sent me the wrong ones, but replaced them. I wanted divided."
These plates are great and you can even cut things on them. They are sturdy and strong good for every day or for barbecue
"I like how absorbent they are, and green too! We have been using this brand now almost a year. I like knowing they break down better than other paper plates and are really sturdy!"
The plates were just the size and sturdiness I wanted. They were white which was a bit nicer appearance for a party.
These divided plates are a good investment in our biodegradable future. They hold quite a bit of food and do not bend. The divided parts are a good proportion. Used them for a Grad party. Good for home use AND the enviroment.
"I like to use disposable divided plates for convenience, and I’m glad to find some that are cheaper and more eco-friendly."
You can't beat these for the price. Great for the break room at work
Made everything easier and then went into the compost bin!
"Sturdy, and i like that there is no design. Plus they were a good deal. No issues so far with durability"
Durability of the plates
Plates were perfect for the gatherings I provided paper products for.
Great product and great plates
Very sturdy and I have plenty leftover for next party!
Exactly as ordered.
Nice size and does not bend when loaded with food
Almost like eating on a regular plate except you get to throw them away.
very please nice and white and arrived in good condition good seller
They were very Sturdy and has no problem with food spilling or food falling out of the plate.
Great product
Durable strong and just the right size
Great plates
sturdy - works better than most that aren’t compostable - pretty plain and I like that
"Used for food, kids crafts Great product"
"Not foam, so I know they won't sit in a landfill for eternity. Delivery was as promised, and well-packed."
"These plates are strong, look nice and biodegradable."
Very strong
Liked that product had less rim. Very sturdy
Very sturdy. Had heavy soup. Works Great. Had no problem.
It does the job. I have 2 boys and this product is perfect for them
Love it. Great alternative to traditional paper plates.
"Used for full meals, as a cutting surface and thawing plate. Works great for all uses."
Love the plates! Great quality. I want to try more items from this company. Knowing that these plates can be safely recycled without issue is amazing and great for the environment.
I tried these plates for the first time and they are great! They are very sturdy and don't leak. Great value.
Perfect
Microwave perfectly I’m very happy with the purchase.
Great sturdy plates for Bbq
the grandkids and pets
Plates are heavy duty and leak proof and I love that they’re eco friendly
"This was a sturdy plate, and I love that it is compostable"
Sturdy for little ones to mix food coloring with vanilla frosting for their gingerbread house “glue” to stick the candy :)
Great product! Purchased for a graduation party and held up very well!!
Very sturdy and awesome price. Will purchase again
Strong and eco friendly
"Excellent, strong compostable paper plate. Not flimsy like many store bought paper plates. Great for entertaining or for everyday use."
Perfect for outdoor picnic with our family and friends.
Awesome as expected
Perfectos para Un eventos familiar
These plates are a great size. I usually purchase the 10 inch size but these are great too. This is the first time I got the white as opposed to the brown and I really like the way they look. Great purchase!
Great paper plates and sturdy and strong
I dont have to use multiple plates for rigidity. I can also use these in the microwave and they hold up to wet items.
these work perfectly for extra bowls.
Good quality plates.
They’re perfect! We’re a family of four and don’t have a fish washer so we LOVE paper plates but have also been trying to be more eco friendly so these plates are great for us! They’re strong and don’t get flimsy
Use these plates every day.
"Like most people said, smaller than expected. The picture is deceiving, but they are very useful for leftovers and smaller portions of salads. I used the big one to hold a pound of cooked ground beef for tacos, grated the cheese in the next size down. The smallest one can hold a nice portion of fruit or custard, etc. as a snack. So though not what I expected, they are useful & store easy. Though definitely not mixing bowls for cakes, etc. I like them & worth keeping."
When I opened the box I was so shocked that they were so small I had to go back and look at what I ordered..i thought they were mixing bowls of different sizes..boy was I wrong ..i decided to keep them and order the correct ones ...
"What a waste of time, money, postage, the UPS guy’s gas, wear and tear of his big brown truck, and the pedometer clicks and his steps to walk that pitiful little package to me only for me to turn around to send these stupid little teeny tiny bowls back to from which they came! I don’t care what the description says— I saw it before I ordered it, and I was STILL displeased with them! The largest bowl looked way smaller than a 32-ounce bowl! And the other three bowls were even smaller than that! Perhaps it’s the picture that they have that made me think the bowls are bigger in person. Maybe they should either change their picture or put a little notation that says something to the tune that the objects are enlarged, and what you’ll really get are some stupid little teeny tiny bowls or something like that!"
"I'm a single person and cook infrequently and i mainly cook fast basic foods and my refrig is small and usually packed with foods, so when I saw all the reviews, I knew the bowls were for me!! Small enough to fit my situation as well as affordable!!  The largest bowl is about the size of an 11 inch chromebook with a volume that will fit 4 cups of liquids or foods so don't buy it if you're cooking for the family and/or have a regular sized refrigerator. If you're making potato/macaroni salad, obviously this bowl which is the largest is NOT going to fit a big enough volume for even a small family or a couple without kids. These bowls only work for single people who use it only for themselves. If you want functional, affordable, NO FRILLS HUGE mixing plastic bowls, walmart has them. Look for ""Mainstays Mixing Bowl Set, 3 Piece, Assorted Sizes, White"" for only about $6.  The lids aren't the best. They take time to snap on but they do snap tight after a while of making sure every part of the bowl is lidded up closed. The bowls are thick and are really ""PREP BOWLS"" for mixing, not storage bowls. I use them for everything from making potato/macaroni salads, to making condiments, to making fried chicken batter mixes, to making/storing pudding, etc. They don't take up much space since each bowl fits in the next bigger one. They satisfy my situation well."
"I wanted bowls that were heavier made than Gladware or Ziploc. These are perfect! They aren't meant to be used to batch cooking storage. They are perfect for baking, scrambling eggs, taco fixings, and so much more.  They wash easily. The lids fit tight and click on and off super easily. The color is such a cool, soothing blue! It kind of reminds me of a tropical blue. I bought two sets and will definitely be buying more for gifts. I love them!!"
"These are so doggone cute! I really like the color but I am KitchenAid crazy anyhow. They nest very nicely with the lids ON. which is unusual. I would not call them heavy-duty but functionable for storing when various sizes matter. They are made of some kind of material that nothing seems to stick to them. I really like them and if you have a problem with the lids for the largest ones being hard to close, just run the lid under very hot water and they will go on just fine. Very nice and very useful.JK"
"A lot of people seem to be upset that these are not mixing bowls, despite the fact that they are clearly marked as PREP bowls and the measurements are clearly defined in the description. As PREP bowls, these are excellent. I really needed something to hold things like chopped onions and minced garlic while I cook, and these serve that purpose perfectly. Very helpful in keeping pre-measured ingredients organized-and are easy to clean as well."
"These are great little prep bowls. Also great for storage with lids. ***Note to buyers, these are “prep bowls” not mixing bowls. So they are not very big. Read the description for sizes. If this is what you are looking for and you like the KitchenAid brand, this is for you."
"This set came much more solid, sturdier than I anticipated for the price. They clean-up is super easy with just a paper towel and soapy water. Great for microwave and dishwasher as well. Spill proof and lids are seal tight. Great product and I never write reviews! Best value I’ve spent for a kitchen item in a long time, very happy."
"Size is so functional for small items like dips, single serve popcorn or treats... etc. I use it to make my chia puddings the night before then roomy to add toppings to same bowl next morning. Great size for meals left overs... small recipe dishes. They travel well too when I need to take a snack to the office. Fits perfectly and easily into a small cooler bag."
"Exactly what I wanted and expected. But then, I did read the description before I ordered. Funny how that makes a difference, eh? Perfect size for snacks, storing leftovers, etc. I love them and would recommend them to anyone."
I thought they would be a little bigger but they are high quality nice bright color and will utilize to take lunch items and leftovers in them.  Stacking feature helps me as I have limited cabinet space.  I would buy again
"When I first opened up the Kitchen Aid prep bowls, I thought they were going to stain easily due to the feel of the material. I was wrong! These are very durable and easy to clean! They have not absorbed any colors at all and they have no lost their color at all. I love them and the mint color is great! I would absolutely recommend these."
"The bowls are exactly what I needed to prepare my smoothie bowls. The 3 cup one is the perfect size for my portion, and it even has a lid for when I need to take it to work. I can use the bowls to freeze the ingredients in, or to prep stuff for dinner. The lid does close tightly, and the color is pretty cute."
"I got a set of these bowls few month ago. They are very versatile. Perfect for serving and then straight to storage. The various sizes make this set ideal for different toppings, sauces, sides, etc. After a few months of use the bowls hold up really well and the lids fit tightly. So now I bought a second set :)"
"Guess I was too lazy to read on this one, but the largest of these bowls is the size of a cereal bowl, in case anyone else also thought they were ordering standard mixing bowls. Good quality, just a bit misleading on the pics."
"These bowls are perfectly sized for food prep, and as they are lidded perfect for planning meal prep ahead of time. Sturdy and don’t take up a lot of room in the cupboard. Love these!"
Perfect smaller sizes for those small amounts that you don't want to waste larger containers and space with. Well marked with capacity.. Tops give nice snug seal. You just ca't go wrong with KitchenAid
"I love my new prep bowls. I’ve been using these constantly since I got them. I read other reviews that the wording immediately washed off, I’ve washed mine quite a few times, and it’s still on all of them. I bought the mint colored ones. Maybe it has been improved, or maybe I’ve just gotten lucky so far."
"I sent these as a gift and they loved them, the color and the quality, hey it is Kitchen Aid, you cannot expect less.,"
"I was thinking they were larger bowls so was a little disappointed when I saw the size, but they will work for sure and are well made. It's hard to tell the size even when you read the description, but I'm glad I bought them."
"I'm pretty sure they can't be used in microwave but they stack inside each other with lids on. Not sure how leak proof or if they can go in freezer. For the price, I love them and the pistachio color is the prettiest. Plenty of uses."
"Please note these are not mixing bowls they are prep bowl way to small for mixing. Still great, I seen some reviews that people thought they were mixing bowls."
"Love this container very much , very easy to clean , durable , just a perfect size for lunch or snacks , so easy to put inside bag and nice color :)  Will buy more for sure"
I’m so glad I purchased these bowls. These bowls are very sturdy and easy to clean. I bake a lot so I really needed them. Very happy with this purchase.
"I love these bowls. They are small, but not too small. They are perfect for storing leftovers. They also are good and sturdy. The lids haven’t bent from my dishwasher. Usually when I wash lids for storage bowls in my dishwasher they start to bend somewhat, but these have not."
These are ideal for prepping. I use them when I make salads to put the different ingredients in so everyone can choose what they want in their salad. I can also store them in the fridge. Very handy
Hate them used a lot but now lids won’t stay on I don’t have a dishwasher and it said not dishwasher safe so can’t seal them
"In the baking business, you can never have enough prep bowls. These bowls are wonderful. The variety of sizes is beneficial, depending on the ingredients I'm using. They're extremely durable. And, the color matches my business colors perfectly. Plus, the price was much better than many places I've seen. I'd definitely order these again."
Smaller than I expected but I love them.
Very nice set got them for snack bowls for work and love them. They stack well in my mini fridge in my office.
These are great for storing pre-prepped ingredients and they store so nicely being stackable. I have one bowl that the lid doesn’t really seem to snap on perfectly but I still am very happy with the purchase. I love the red color too.
"I like these, very good quality. My mistake though... much smaller than I expected. Not really mixing bowl. Small but I will use them."
"Good, sturdy and nicely sized storage bowls or food prep bowls."
Lightweight and stacks together. Easy to clean- I’m ordering another set!
There great. But small. So don't use foe large amounts
"I am completely satisfied with the bowls. I love the third sturdiness the are you red color, The brand also perfect size for my area that I have room for in my cabinet"
"Love the durability and sturdiness of these bowls, great prep bowls with lids for each. Very easy to clean. I need another set for food storage also"
I love these. I use them mostly for baking. I'll measure out my dry ingredients and store for when I wait for my butter to reach room temp. Super helpful.
"Excellent set, matches with other green Kitchenaid products. Easy to clean, very sturdy and conveniently sized from 1 to 4 cups. Get them, you'll be happy you did."
"Makes baking and cooking go faster, use as little bowls for recipes with a lot of ingredients"
"It probably says it in the discription but while these can go in the dishwasher, the vinyl or whatever is used for the text will wipe away. I bought them because my boyfriend loved the ones I had. He loves it still but just a little bummer he put them in washer instead of hand washing. Very useful!"
Couldn’t find anything wrong with this
Bought these for my mom who can’t lift heavy weights. This is a nice light weight set. Super cute
Great for food prep and storage. They are small. I use them when chopping vegetables for meal prep.
This was a great buy! I love them for when I have to prep a couple things like for taco nights! The color is perfect too!
"Everything u could want from prep bowl or storage or leftover uses, take for lunch and easy to heat. Love color and quality is HIGH"
So perfect for prep and storage.
These are perfect to have on hand when staying home. Just the right sizes and love the lids.
These are very nice bowls. I thought they were the larger size. These are small but very useful.
So sleek and great storage
"Nice set of prep and storage bowls for my homemade dips, dressings and cashew cheese concoctions. Stores tight and leakproof. Love the color, matches my turquoise beach kitchen well. Stack together for neat storage when not in use."
This product is great. Easy to clean and the kids are great.
Really well made-smaller than I thought they’d be but I like em! Haven’t used them yet but you can tell they are strong and durable
These bowls are very nice. They stack into each other. Takes less space in the cabinet. The different sizes are very useful
Great product
Convenient small size of these nesting bowls got small amounts of food. Nice red color of bowls.
Easy to use
Sturdy material.
I bought this as a gift that I ended up keeping. These are very handy. On the bottom had the cup size. These are sturdy.
These are great quality and take little storage space.
Great quality dishwasher safe
"As described, good quality, arrived quickly"
"Love them, great sizes and tops. Just remember they are not microwave safe."
Perfect for what I was looking for.
This is what I was looking for for my camp trailer. Easy to store work great.
"Love that these bowls stack into each other to save space, easy to clean, lids are easy to use."
Well built in great for what they are. And of course they match on the other KitchenAid empire read items. Took off one star for durability because if the KitchenAid name is important to you it won’t be on the bowls after about 3 to 4 months of washing them. Other than that the nesting in the covers are great.
The bowls are very small. The largest one is just bigger than a cereal bowl. The lids fit very loosely. I expected better from Kitchenaid.
These bowls are the perfect size for leftovers
"Just got this set, so can't fully comment. It was well packaged and seems to be just what I'm looking for. It fits into my drawer and refrig space,which is pretty small. I wanted something that can used for storage and cooking and easy to see so this should fit the bill. The lids seem easy to use, which is what I read on some reviews was a problem."
I love these bowls. Bought them to use for Thanksgiving. The lids fit snuggly and keep food fresh. The bowls will fit inside each other so they don't take up too much room in the cabinets. Seem to be easy to clean. Only gave 4 stars for durability because I have had a chance to use them on a regular basis since the purchase. I highly recommend.
Love these! No more hunting lids or hand washing plastic. Went from fridge to microwave to dish washer. Can't get any better. And great size variety. My daughter is getting her own set too!!
"They seal and don’t leak, so good for storage or for travel. I love that they nest so fit together in a small space. Since they are glass, are good for the environment, sturdy and attractive enough to put on the table when guests come.  Not light weight, not too heavy either, but if you want sturdy, this is a trade-off I’m happy to accept."
"I love these!!! I’m so glad I bought them. I was concerned about durability, but these are made out of thick glass. They seal really well and are very cute. Plus they all nest inside each other making it convenient for storage."
All the bowls arrived perfect and exactly what I anticipated. The lids are a different story there were 2 that the snaps were broke off during shipping. Box was in great shape and the bowls were just fine. Other than the 2 lids I love the product.
Loved the concept but the snap on one was broken
I’m impressed with these so far. What is great is being able to easily have a perfect air tight seal for left overs. The bowls are nice and thick as well and the lids have come put of the dishwasher top shelf just fine.
"When I saw the bowls I was expecting a flimsy floppy strap for the lid. They came and it is hard plastic and once the lid is properly sealed to the bowl will ""handle"" a full bowl. I just got them 2 days ago and haven't used them yet. But I am so excited to. I have four boys and their families that come over every Sunday so they are much needed and will be used often!!"
Always happy to find ways to save space in cabinets of small kitchen. These help.
"I love the nesting idea, so they don’t use a lot of space and I don’t have to wonder where are the kids. The lids attach easily and they are machine wash safe."
These are not light weight bowls. Good sturdy glass each with a locking lid. I didn’t know I needed these until I got them. My son loves making bread he now uses the largest bowl for overnight rising
"Received fast and the glass bowls are perfect for my baking needs, light and durable. Lids seal tight and fit so the bowls stack which saves room. I love these bowls Though I did need one size larger size bowl and ordered which fits with the set"
Replacing my old Tupperware bowls with these glass nesting mixing and storage bowls. I like everything about them. They stack and the larger one has a handle for easy carrying. The lids fasten tight to use for storing food. They are dishwasher and microwave safe. And I never have to search for the lid!
"Clear, lids fit perfectly, sizes are perfect."
Great assortment of bowls with snap-on lids. The largest bowls snap-on lid also has a handle. Great way to transport.
These are the best glass bowls I’ve ever purchased. Plastic lids are durable and connect into the bowls easily. Biggest bowl has a handle which is awesome! All bowls fit into each other empty with lids attached to make storing much easier! What a fantastic purchase!
I'm glad I found these. Very qualitative and I love that these are oven safe.
These bowls are great because we can finally see exactly what leftovers are in our fridge. Tops are very secure and sturdy. I’m buying a second set.
Cooking mixing bowl and food storage. I like the snap down lid tops. This is a great set. The five different sizes make it easy to carry lunch.
No leaks
"I cook a lot and these bowls are a great addition. They are sturdy, thick and clear. Tops fit perfectly. I use them daily. I’m fortunate enough to have more than one kitchen and I have these stackable bowls in everyone. I’ve also sent them to friends as a gift. My favorite item. Get then now."
Great set of bowls! You won’t be disappointed!
Great bowls. Love that they are glass with lids.
They were exactly what I needed them for. I’ve used the larger bowl to make bread in.
BUY
Great item for storage!
❤
"I really like these bowls. The quality is very good. I love the locking lids and that they nest nicely. The only con is that sometimes I'm not sure that one of the lid locks really locked, not enough of a ""click"" to let me know that I really got it down, so I have to double check it. But that's not a big deal. I highly recommend!"
Love this product. THANK YOU
Great quality and customer service!
"Great bowls, convenient sizes!"
I like this product
Seals well and sturdy. What more can you ask for.
Good quality
Exactly what I expected. I’ve been great to cook with and store food. Highly recommend
Good fitting lids
Very good item will buy this for a friend or family member and a house warming gift.
"I love these glass bowls, however the snap on locking piece has broken twice! The first time it snapped off I was able to return it for a new set because it was within the return window. This second time was upsetting because the piece broke again and it was beyond the return window by 10 days so now I’m stuck with a lid that doesn’t snap on and seal correctly. I would advise you not to buy anything with hard plastic snap on pieces. They are not durable."
"We have the bowls, they look and feel well made. They nest really well which is a big improvement over what we had. Happy so far!"
Loved that each size had a locking lid!
"The glass bowls are very nice, sturdy, great for the oven or microwave."
Just what I needed for preparing and storing food. Love the locking lids!
For everyday mixing and storing. I think everyone should have a set of these bowls and they would be wonderful wedding gifts.
I really like the set. Very happy with my purchase.
"Storing leftovers, serving popcorn, mixing batters."
Great bowls and the lids are perfect
Very nice bowls. They can be put in microwave and they stack.
"Unfortunately, one of the bowls was broken when it arrived. They were nested with packing material between each, but one of the middle bowls was shattered. I didn't realize it until it tried to pick up the bowl nested inside it and cut my finger on a glass shard. I was concerned about the sturdiness of the bowls, but the others looked fine, were heavy and thick. I assumed that the package must have taken a hard lick or drop to shatter the inside bowl that seemed well packed. I decided to ask for a replacement set because I really need glass mixing bowls and these, especially with the lids, seemed exactly what I wanted. I am glad to say that the replacement set was delivered just 3 days following the first set and so far I am happy with them. I will probably will be careful with them even though they are rated microwave and dishwasher safe, until I get over my initial concern."
"The bowls are too small for me to consider them mixing bowls, they are more so storage containers. I might have kept them for the purpose of storage but they are Not leak proof so something like soup puld spill out and I would want to travel with them for get togethers. I returned it, it didnt work at mixing bowls and leaky tops didnt make it good for storage or keeping food fresh. I also didnt notice that only the big bowl had a handle on the lid and not all the containers."
"I was really excited about these bowls and they are a great product like I had hoped… with the exception of receiving them damaged. The largest one came with a chip on the bottom, see pictures. It had to have happened during the packing process, not from Amazon but at the manufacture, as they were in their own box with plenty of secure packaging material. A quality control issue that definitely slipped through the cracks, I’d say.  Outside of the damage to the largest bowl, the lids fit securely and the seals seem to do their job. I will update if that changes."
"I just took this product out of the box, just minutes before I started typing this, I noticed two of the lids are broken, I thought you know what? Bad luck happens to anyone, and decided to just try and ask the seller for replacements for the lids, but as I started reading reviews, this appears to be more than just bad luck, this is more like quality recklessness on the seller's part, I'm not the only person whom this happens to, and as other buyers have pointed out, this is bound to happen again with a replacement, so will I ask for a replacement? No, I don't think I will, I will keep this as a reminder of what to do next time, so some research before buying things."
"Updated: New bowls are working well, though we are keeping the lids hand wash only to prevent distorting the gaskets again.  Old Review: Arrived broken from the manufacturer (clamp on the green lid) and the blue gasket was too big for the lid, meaning the largest bowl with the lid handle would not close easily. Replacement ordered, I'll update this review if the next set comes in one piece."
"Upon opening the box and unstacking the neatly self contained bowls we noticed the smallest bowls lid was missing one of the latches, and No we didn’t break it off, in fact it wasn’t even in with the sealed bowls, I did notice many other people complaining about broken latches but thought maybe they had ran it through the dishwasher making them brittle but definitely not in this case, it was just poor product quality and then NO quality control before being packaged. Typical CHINA junk."
"I am in a quandry as to wether or not to return these. The bowls are exactly what I expected as are the lids for the bigger bowls. However, the lids for the smaller bowls seem to be defective, in that they don't stay sealed."
"Only reason I rated it a 4 out of 5 is because one of the lid snaps came broken. Other then that, great and I use them for literally everything. From dinner salads to food prepping"
These are very nice bowls. I love having a tight fitting cover on storage bowls. The covers are easy to put on and off.
me gustan mucho me ayudan en el almacenamiento en mi cocina son perfectos
Amazon shipped and they didn’t even put any bubble wrap or anything in the box to protect these ! The glass was ok but the tops were busted in pieces. Looked to be very heavy nice set but have to return due to not packing worth a crap ! Reordered from Walmart… hopefully they pack the correct. I really like the heaviness of the set
The lids are so sharp they sliced my finger twice. Stupid me not thinking they were all sharp!!
"When they showed up, I was so happy to see how well the nesting system worked. Unfortunately, the biggest lid with the handle doesn't snap on the glass any longer. I have only hand washed. Plastic snaps aren't secure. However, washing them is so easy! The colored ring comes out to wash easily. Bowls are great for storage and baking/cooking. Great for salad bowls."
"My biggest bowl chipped one of the first times I washed it! It lightly bumped the sink and some edging fell off, pretty annoyed over it. Don’t think Id recommend"
"These bowls are truly awful. The lids easily warp, and once warped, are extremely difficult to seal to the bowl. The awkward design of the lids makes them difficult to store. They also have fairly sharp edges and will constantly nick and cut your hands as you wrestle to apply them to the bowls. The overhang of the lid closing mechanism takes up more space in the refrigerator than conventional bowls. This is a terribly designed product that I regret purchasing. I threw them out."
Nice and heavy sturdy bowls but not all the lids fit correctly.
"These bowls seal well, I've used for guacamole, they're great in the oven & microwave too...jyst don't nest them, yes they're sized to nest but the rims chip easily. I purchased in march and 2 of the bowls have chipped, which means the lids won't seal, also the handle for the largest bowl cracked. I won't be buying this brand again, for $50 some $s I'd like them to last longer."
"Chipped bowl and a broken lid out of the box. Not much more to say as they are simple glass bowls and will continue to function as such - but I thought I was paying extra for quality, and was wrong."
I was so excited to receive these bowls but two of the lids had broken clips. I felt that it was an o dictation that the lid clips would break easily so i returned then and chose mixing bowls with lids that do not have clips.
Lids fit well and easy to snap on and off. Good size bowls also.
Having variety of sized with lid is nice. Easy to store in the cover or in a refrigerator. Lids are not easy to close so I gave 3 stars.
There is no way this is tempered glass! In less than a year all of these bowls have shattered. Just from opening and closing the drawer they were in... not a good product.
Such pretty colors and designs. Made durable and good quality. I’m very happy with them.
"Beautiful bowls i love bright colors, and patterns. I loved these bowls the minute I laid my eyes on them, they are thick porcelein with great detail colors. They are fine to place in the dishwasher and work well in the microwave. They seems very durable, they’ve completely lived up-to my expectation."
"solid - i've crashed other glassware into them a few times, and the bowls have not chipped. They are nice to look at, lovely colors/patterns. so much more pleasant aesthetically than boring old white bowls."
"I'm not one to write reviews right off the bat. A lot of people get excited about something they've purchased, and if it looks good, they're shooting out 5-stars with rave reviews before they've even had it an hour. Me, not so much.... I have a big family, so 5 stars from me means you REEEAAALLLY passed the test. I've had this set for about a month now. I bought them for my children who've developed a love of asian foods and eating with chopsticks, so I thought they'd love having their noodles in these colorful bowls. When I received the package, I was first of all, really, really happy with how meticulously well packaged they were. That was outstanding to me in and of itself. When I saw the bowls themselves, I was floored. They were, and still are, stunning. I mean really, really beautiful. I've never been so pleased or more proud of a set of bowls in my life. XD. The colors are so bright and vivid... They are dishwasher safe and are holding up sturdiness-wise like nothing I've seen, considering they're used daily and I mean DAILY by a family of 9. If you are considering these, don't even hesitate, they are well worth it. I will be purchasing some of the larger sets in the near future. And just to give an idea on portion size, these hold a good 11 to 12 oz of soup."
"Gorgeous little bowls, perfect for a cup of miso soup or a small handful of snacks. I love the bright cheery colors and patterns."
"We ordered bowls for our business from Amazon. They arrived exactly as expected and they were packed with a impact resistant mesh. The bowls were very pretty online and even more attractive once we received them. The bowls are the perfect size for a small salad, soup, or just enjoying a larger sized parfait which is mostly what we will be using them for. The bowls seem sturdy and I am happy that we can put them in the dishwasher and microwave."
"The description says these bowls hold 23 ounces. They actually hold 16 ounces. If you filled them with 23 ounces of liquid they would be filled to the brim or overflowing. I already own 16 oz. bowls, but I wanted something larger for gumbo. These hold the exact same amount as my 16 oz. bowls. They are pretty, but calling them 23 oz. is misleading. Maybe this is just the way all bowls are sold, but I just wanted to clarify this for anyone who is thinking like I did. See attached photos showing 16 oz. vs. 23 oz."
"These bowls are beautiful. I love the color and variety. They did great in the dishwasher. They’re just the right size for cereal, soup or dessert. They were packaged very nicely for shipping."
"I love these bowls! The colors are vibrant, they hold a generous portion, and I was really surprised at how well they did in the microwave. I made oatmeal (1 minute on high) and stood by the whole time in case they weren't as ""microwave safe"" as they claimed. (I have had other bowls get screaming hot in the microwave after just one minute, despite their claims to be microwaveable.) Well, I worried for nothing because the bowl didn't get any warmer than the oatmeal. In fact, the top of the bowl- which didn't have any oatmeal toughing it- was still cool, so it appears that the bowl doesn't heat independently of the food inside. They are not very thick so I'm not sure how they would fare if they knocked against other dishes in the sink or dishwasher, but so far they're doing great."
"These bowls are a great addition if you are looking for smaller service sizes (my first priority), bright, bold, fun colors (a definite plus), and well-made. Because of all of the colors, these are fun desert bowls. I also use them as cereal bowls for locally made granola - just the right serving size versus the usual giant serving bowl. For kids, and the kids in all of us, the bold colors also make for a fun ice cream bowl, and can give a ""look how full the bowl is"" visual with more reasonable serving sizes. Pretty obvious that portion size matters in my selection, but my review would be the same if these were giant ramen bowls. The colors and quality are the pop, the sizzle, at a good price. The size of this particular set appeals to my inner sensibility without sacrificing the visual pleasure that we all expect in what we eat and enjoy. I think you will like them."
"I came across the listing for these bowls today and it showed that I bought mine coming up on two years ago...I had hesitated because I was afraid they would chip or break easily, but now not only do I love how they look, I can certainly speak to their durability. All the usual things are positive, like microwave and dishwasher safe, without chipping, but I also used a couple of mine as holders for planters on my balcony. They are both classy looking and boho cool. I also have moved and nary a chip! Only thing though is I wanted all of them inside, so now I need something else for my flowers! And I also see they have plates now, which I will have to purchase! HIGHLY recommend!"
"I love these bowls. They are so bright and cheery. Beautiful designs and they are a perfect size. Not huge but not tiny. These are great! And they are not thin/delicate. Picture shows a 1 cup measuring cup for purposes of how deep and how much the bowls can hold. (Obviously can hold over 1 cup, maybe close to 2 cups of cereal, soup, etc.  I dont know how durable they are since I just bought them, but the quality seems really good! Highly recommend for anyone wanting to add some color to their kitchen."
"They are very sturdy, nice weight. They are deeper than I anticipated but not as wide. I put a grapefruit in one to give you an idea of the size. I microwaved a whole can of soup in one. I had to use a towel to remove the bowl but it cooled to the touch quickly, and the soup remained nice and hot. I can't speak to durability because I haven't had them very long. I soaked them in detergent and scalding water before first use. I haven't put them in the dishwasher so I can't speak to that. So far, I love these bowls. They're beautifully colored, convenient, and add a nice touch to my kitchen."
"I'll preface my review by saying I returned these bowls. I hated to do that because they are beautiful, sturdy and, according to description, they are also microwaveable, dishwasher safe and even can be used in the oven. The bowls would have been perfect for me except for one thing ... they are not large enough for my use. The description states they can hold 23 fluid ounces. As I found out fluid ounces or not the same as regular or standard ounces. The bowls actually hold about 16 standard ounces. I needed bowls to hold items like caldo, menudo, stew, gumbo etc. A 16 ounce bowl will not work in my family. I recommend this product if you use 16 ounce bowls ... if not, get something bigger."
"I was impressed with the photos of the product, very colorful design, size available (perfect), and the ease with which I was able to complete the order. The bowls are more beautiful than the photos, and I am impressed with the solid feel and sound they make when stacked, or silverware is placed into them."
"I bought this set almost 4 months ago and very pleased with size, colors, and durability. We use them for breakfast bowls, soup servings, dinner bowls for some sides, & storage for leftovers. Versatile! Great too that there’s many different color schemes in each set. It’s just the right size for our applications, some bowls we had were shallow & not big enough, and many others are too big. No problem with color vibrancy of these bowls after 4 months of almost daily dishwashing."
"I really like these bowls. They are the perfect size for cereal or a small salad, soup, etc. Not too big or too small. They are colorful and cheerful and don't seem to chip easily. They also do just great in the dishwasher."
"I saw and used these bowls on a recent visit to my daughter's home. Loved the colors and the size and quality. I browsed Amazon's similar offerings and decided these were indeed the best. I almost chose a porcelain set that had equally beautiful appeal, but realized that porcelain is thinner than ceramic, and I knew that they would be more delicate. I wanted the durability of these. And the packaging!! Oh my goodness, they were packaged with perfection!"
"I ordered this bowl in order to temporarily hold food until I eat it. I find this bowl is perfect for this use. It is pretty much a hollowed out semi-circle with a stand at the bottom. Without this stand, the bowl could roll one way or another and spill the contents, especially if you filled it with a soup or similar liquid. If you wanted, you could also use this bowl to hold small items like loose change or jewelry or things of that nature. The open top makes it easy to remove items with your hand or eating utensils."
absolutely gorgeous bowls I've seen these for a while now and been in love with them but my daughter found them when she asked for bowls for Christmas for her dorm she wanted something pretty and different and I showed her these and she fell in love so that is what she got little fancy for a dorm but hey why not she absolutely loves them my only concern is it does not say if they are microwave or dishwasher safe anywhere on the packaging or in the box can somebody please let me know so that she knows whether or not she can wash them in a dishwasher someday and if they're microwave safe
"I kept eyeing these bowls, but hesitated for fear that they wouldn't hold much or would be too delicate for our household. I'm glad I jumped on them when the price dropped because they're perfect. They're just as pretty as depicted and they hold a nice amount. I used one to make a burrito bowl for dinner and the amount was more than sufficient. Plus they have a nice thickness, not thin like china, and stack up nice and compact in our small kitchen cabinets. Added bonus - they add a pretty pop of color when used alongside our white bistro plates. I highly recommend these bowls."
"Beautifully smooth and colorful rice or cereal bowls - beautiful and varied inside and outside patterns - these are festive and beautiful additions to my kitchen - I'm happy to serve guests using these but enjoy them myself every day. Well crafted and perfectly smooth with no bumps, seams, or edges - feels very high quality and a delight to hold. Just the right size for a full rice bowl meal or a generous portion of cereal."
"My son wanted mis-matched style dishes and bowls. These were perfect as they matched - but it was not an obvious match. Example; the inside of one bowl, matched the outside of the other bowl X 3. They are a nice size for cereal, soup, pastas, etc. I love them and he was happy with his gift."
"I purchased these with the upcoming holidays in mind. It is no longer acceptable for people to pick snacks out of the same bowl. These are perfect. You can put a few snacks in each bowl, and give them to your guests as the sit down. Nobody feels awkward, and when they empty the bowl, you can politely ask if they would like some more. These are the perfect size for me. It could be nuts, goldfish, or even small pretzels, these will work out. For me this was a really good purchase. I will be using these for years to come."
"Our family really loves these bowls. Vibrant colors and fun designs. Nice size. Upgraded from normal, everyday, whatever bowls. Feels special and exotic. getting six bowls for this price is really extraordinary. Had them a few months. We try to be careful with them. But we get lazy and through them in the dishwasher too. So far, no chips or cracks. (knocks on head) Hope they last a long time. If not, they are so cheap, I'll just by more."
"(Photo shows five bowls - one was in the dishwasher) Perfect size for cereal, ice cream, soup...These bowls are GORGEOUS!! Just exactly as described. Well made, GREAT QUALITY, very easy to clean. They came so fast, within two days of ordering. I'm immensely pleased and would definitely buy again. I don't need anything else but...I'm now eyeing some of their other products...."
"These are gorgeous, and so fun! So unique, and I love that each bowl is different, inside and out. They are a great size for soup, Asian noodles, ice cream, etc. They do seem a little delicate, but I have not had them for long enough to attest to their durability. I will be careful with handling. I expect to get lots of compliments on these (as soon as we can start having dinner parties again...)"
"I picked up some bowls similar to these but larger at a local box store and loved the patterns. After searching, I found these. They are perfect for what I was needing them for. I use them for everything! Ice cream, side dishes, salsa, nuts, queso, etc. Its the perfect size and love the bright, fun colors. You can run them through the dishwasher; and I periodically do, but other times I hand wash them. I am planning on purchasing a few more in the very near future as they are so cute and work for lots of items!"
This is the second set of bowls in this style that I've purchased. I love them. They make me so happy with their unique designs and colors. They've held up really well going in and out of the microwave and dishwasher. Well worth the money to bring a smile to my face while I eat cereal or soup.
"Theses bowls were exactly what I was looking for. They are just as pretty as pictured and are well made. They work great for making oatmeal in the microwave because they are deep. I purchased the larger ones and I’am very pleased. I took the measurements of these before I bought them and compared them to bowls I already had so I’d hoped they would work for me, and they did. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed."
"I love these bowls! They are vibrant in color, well-made, very sturdy and perfect for snacks or smaller portions of side dishes. My regular dinnerware is neutral in color so these had a nice pop to my collection and the cupboards look more fun!"
At first I wasn’t sure if I ordered something that was cheaply made and I‘d be sorry. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality at the price point. (My husband already has a favorite color combination to eat his ice cream!) I especially liked the Thank You note that was included. In this impersonal world it was a nice personal touch! I will order from your company again and will not feel hesitant. I kinda feel like I made a friend.
"I was looking for deep bowls for oatmeal, cereal and soup and came across these. All the high reviews are spot on. I've only owned them for a few weeks, but the size is perfect if not a little smaller than what I was expecting. I wouldn't use these for pasta, but for soups, stews, cereal & oatmeal they are deep and wide enough. Very functional and nice to look at. It's not heavy and I can see how they may chip if you don't handle them with care, but they are really colorful and perky. I have an all white dinner set, so this goes ok with it but I mainly use them on their own. Good for the price & purpose."
The last set of dishes I bought at 2nd hand store years ago..Finally this year I decided to save some money for new dishes.I first bought the smaller bowls and then the larger bowls.Next I will buy the plates..I think if you are on a budget like me then you can buy what you need at that time then add to the set..These bowls are well made and no imperfections. I love them..Can't wait to get plates at the end of the month.
"Yeah, I am excited about bowls. I need to get out more.  In my defense, these are really good bowls. They have a nice texture to them, the colors really stand out, and they hold stuff. The color contrast is very cool. They are made well and feel solid.  You never think about whether dinnerware should be interesting, or simply functional, until you get some interesting stuff. How can bowls be fun? I don't know, but these are fun."
"These small bowls are perfect for a single rice serving, miso soup, or a moderate dessert. They are beautiful to look at and a pleasure to hold. They arrived very well packaged and protected. So well, in fact, that they suffered no damage when I dropped the box down three concrete steps onto a brick patio. (Don't do what I did.)  I look forward to adding more Dowan products to my kitchen."
"Bought these to cheer up dessert, and the colors and patterns match the photo. The size is perfect, accommodating two rounded scoops of ice cream. They are very light in weight, but so far haven't shown any chipping in use or through the dishwasher. The packaging was extraordinary, with each bowl found in its own foam netting bag. I was concerned when I saw a corner of the shipping box crushed in but there was no damage to the bowls."
"These bowls are beautiful and space saving. I was going to return them because of holding heat that burned when held. I learned that there are ""bowl huggers"" that can be used to hold the bowl and won't get hot for us to hold! I ordered them because I ""love"" the size and looks of the bowls themselves and did not want to get rid of them! Love these bowls, I use them all the time!"
"These are deep cereal bowls, the perfect size for a side salad or any side. The bold design is a huge plus.  I've used these in the microwave for the last month with no problems and the same with the dishwasher.  I only wish they made an entire line of plates and dinnerware. I bought the larger salad bowls as well and just love them.  We need plates, Dowan!"
These bowls look and feel high quality. Bright color. Perfect size. I wish I had matching plates and cups.
"SO FAR, I LOVE these beautiful bowls! Since they JUST arrived I haven't had the opportunity to tell if they ARE really dishwasher/microwave safe as advertised. However, they LOOK lovely! Bowls arrived VERY well packed (VERY WELL!) promptly - in time for use for our Christmas dinner!  HOWEVER, I AM a bit ""spooked,"" by the fact that DOWAN responded to my Amazon review using a ""User Name,"" that I DID NOT SUPPLY nor is available on my Amazon account! Hmmm..."
Super nice plates and sturdy! We bought them for a special dinner occasion and our friends loved them! We got a lot of complements! Great size and perfect for the dishwasher. Color and design looking as new and we use these every day. We use the dishwasher every 2 days. 100% recommended!
"I purchased the 4.75"" bowls. I just love the colors. Not too heavy, not too delicate - they're just right. I feel happy when I eat from these bowls. They're the perfect size for snacks. If you're into portion control, these bowls are a good place to start. Would buy again to gift to a friend."
Really nice bowls. Many bowls here have the designs just printed on or are pretty expensive and you're better off going to a real store. These are both affordable while being actually glazed bowls of a nice size and shape. The colors are fun. There must have been some corners cut somewhere to make them affordable but after a month or so of use I haven't figured out what it is.
"Beyond pleased with these. Wanted smaller portion bowls for ice cream, leftovers, cereal, whatever, and these are perfect. Beautiful colors, perfect small size. Grandkids, hubby and myself all love the size and its fun to pick ‘your’ color theme. Dishwasher safe and stack for easy storage. Arrived quickly and early. What is not to like?!"
"We use these delightful bowls for everything, hot & cold cereal, ice cream, fruit salads, you name it. Though they're smallish, they hold more than you'd expect, and they provide some visual variety to mealtime. They seem to be holding up to my hand washing as well."
Best cereal bowls I have found! Perfect size for cereal or for soup. I am not crazy about the colors but that’s just me. I like more subdued colors but the size etc. of these bowls outweigh that and we use them almost every day.
Very attractive. Amazon also has a set of coasters that match these bowls perfectly so look for those. Holds a progresso sized can of soup. Not to heavy to hold freely in front of the tv. Perfect cereal bowls. Ive dishwashed 3 times so far with no probs .will update if any issues.
"These bowls are a great size for cereal, stews or other things like that. I've used them in the microwave with no problem. The colors are vibrant and I've washed them in the dishwasher many times with on fading or other issues."
Not only are the bowls lovely and beautifully patterned; the packaging was simply the BEST. The bowls could have withstood a trip to Outer Space! I highly recommend Dowan cereal bowls and look forward to ordering more Dowan products in the future!
I recently purchased these bowls in both sizes. I was really impressed when I received them. They are really well made and beyond adorable. The small size works perfectly for soup for the kids or any snacks they have and the larger size is perfect for adults. I also love all of the fun patterns! They are made out of porcelain and seem to be pretty sturdy.
"The bowls are really cheery, and bright so fun..but I thought they would be shaped a little differently from the photos. They are SUPER deep for how wide they are and it is awkward eating out of them...might just be me, but I prefer a bowl that is not straight up and down but curves out slightly to provide a better look/feel"
"We’ve had these for over a month and so far so good. Love the colors and the size. We ordered both the larger bowl’s and the smaller bowls in the same design. ** They say they are microwave safe, but be careful because they get extremely hot very quickly. Our old pottery bowls did not seem to get as hot as these ones do."
Used em for about a few uses. The size isn't huge but almost just right for portions of what you'd put in a bowl. The designs are so cool. Put in the microwave for about two minutes. the food got hot and the bowl wasn't hot to hold. So love that. These are damn near perfect.
"Only 5 if the 6 survived the shipping and unless I was willing to return them all I am stuck. I love the bowls but as the package was Not damaged, I think it was broken before it left the warehouse. Otherwise, they are beautiful bowls."
"Gave these as a gift to a friend fighting breast cancer. The colors are beautiful, size is perfect for her for soup, oatmeal and other small portions. Her kids use it for ice cream and cereal. One of her friends bought the sane set. Getting one for me too."
Got these bowls to replace the standard salad bowls that came with our dinnerware collection. My initial concern would be the bowl height and when I could stack 6 on the same shelf where the old bowls lived. The colorfulness of the bowls was the selling point. Happy and impressed with the initial durability. Would recommend them.
I purchased these for ice cream but have used them when making pot stickers. Great size for serving ice cream with some toppings. Also versatile enough to be used for other things. Love the colorful variety and that they are dishwasher safe. Single personal size bowl.
"I have been using these bowls for a few weeks now n they've been holding up great. They are sturdy, have good capacity and the design patterns look great! They serve their purpose well, I'm happy with the purchase."
"Bought these for a Christmas gift. Wasn’t sure what to get this particular person. I had these in my “save for later” cart, for myself. I decided to get these for the person I was shopping for and they loved them. I thought they will very nicely made, colors were beautiful and I didn’t realize the insides of the bowls reflected the outside designs … they were all the same but different. Will buy these for myself eventually."
I love these bowls...my ice cream bowls cracked and I needed to buy a new set- the color and design of these bowls will brighten any kitchen. They are the perfect size and I am so happy I decided to buy them. I have already recommended them to a few people.
No wonder these bowls are so highly rated! They are so cute and can be used for everything from ice cream to salsa. Everyone who sees them wats them. Not very often you get a compliment every time!
These bowls are very unique and add a beautiful addition to my dishes. I like the size and they fit nicely into the dishwasher. I have only used them once and hope they hold up with frequent use. Happy
"I love these bowls! Not only do they look wonderful but they are light and easy to clean. Since I have owned them only for about a week, I will wait judgement as to durability."
"These colorful bowls are of a perfect size, are perfectly shaped for sipping out of, and are designed so that holding them on your fingers is very comfortable while sipping from them ."
"The bowls are the perfect size for ice cream, dessert or a snack. They are very colorful and seem to be pretty sturdy. They were a gift to my daughter, but I was there when she got them and I was very impressed. The price is very reasonable! I plan to order a set for myself."
"This is the second time I've bought this set of bowls. They're great for literally everything - microwaveable, machine washable (without fading). Everyone loves them for their colors, but they're really sturdy, too. My daughter knocked two of them off the kitchen island onto the hard tile floor and neither broke!"
I have been looking for pretty bowls for a while. These are perfect. I have purchased the small and soup/cereal size bowls. I think they should put them in a set so you don't have to buy individually.
We recently gave away all the kiddie bowls we had when our kids were little and realized that we had nothing smaller than a cereal bowl anymore. These are exactly the right size for a side dish of fruit or applesauce. AND THEY ARE SO CUTE. Real joy sparkers. So glad I found these :)
"I love this design and the bowls are great size for soups. Also bought the matching plates and smaller bowls and LOVE them! Dishwasher and microwave safe too, can't go wrong. GET them!"
"These bowls are wonderful! I have many big mixing bowls and they all weight a ton. As I've aged, I've found it harder and harder to maneuver with large, heavy bowls. These are the perfect solution: they nest perfectly and they're lightweight and are easy to carry and use. The rubber bottoms don't slide around the counter, the rubber handle stays put in your hand, and the pour spouts are great when pouring anything. I especially like them when making an apple pie - the largest bowl is perfect to toss sliced apples with sugars and spices (nothing lands on the counter). The medium one is perfect for mixing the crust and the small one is perfect for mixing the sugars. Like everything else OXO makes, these are designed with real people in mind. Also, clean-up is a breeze, although I have not put mine in the dishwasher - they clean so easily that's I just wash them by hand."
"These bowls are a great weight - not so thin that they go ""oval"" when you grip them in the crook of your arm and hold them tightly against your body to secure them and not too thick. And oh, heh, with the non-slip bottom and handhold, and their perfect weight, you don't have to make stirring a whole body effort ever again. They don't stain, they are very easy to clean. Seriously, if I had found these long ago, I'd have cooked more. I think I'm going to give them as Christmas gifts this year. Buy these!"
"As of January 2019 I started on a healthy Keto way of life (WOE) as well as IF (Intermittent Fasting); I really missed having sweets (on Healthy Keto you eat good fats, some protein and very low carbs); I found so many recipes on Instagram, Facebook, and via Google for alternative sweet desserts but I really needed some good mixing bowls. My Mom had the typical ceramic big bowl and I had a glass one - both really nice but visions of me dropping them? NOT good. So I invested in these bowls which are SO sturdy and easy to use. I use the yellow one to mix my stuff and then the green or blue to put my salads in. I love the rubber handle on them and the rubber bottom. I've had them for over 3 weeks and put them in the dishwasher and made a lot of Keto desserts in them! I love these mixing bowls!!"
"I bought these to use for...well, mixing. I was previously using glass Pyrex bowls which aren't ideal. Things tended to splash out of the bowl when aggressively mixing something since they are so shallow and slippery. I started using a large plastic Tupperware style bowl which worked but eventually cracked. Hence this purchase.  These are nice, what I would call heavy duty, mixing bowls. Compared to the plastic bowl I mentioned these are much thicker. Hopefully that provides a good reference. I am not so sure about the rubber handles yet. Have not seen a need for them, but they don't get in the way when using or cleaning so it's not a negative or positive at this point.  What you cannot tell from the picture is the contours of the inside of the bowls. They are flat at the bottom for a good amount and the side come up from there on a slight angle with no sharp angle at the bottom to trap ingredients. So for me they are perfect for mixing batter without stuff splashing out yet you can get to all of the ingredients without having to dig into a crevice.  Good set of bowls that are well made and should last a long time."
"I love these bowls. I particularly like the fun colors. I was originally purchasing the white, but then I saw the different colors. The different colors are fun and festive. The bowls handle wonderfully. They're sized properly, easy to grip and the no-slide bottom works. Clean up is a snap.Of course, I'm not sure I ever bought an OXO product I didn't like.  The only thing I will caution, is if you use a hand-mixer, you will see slight marks instead of the glossy finish. But that happens with all types of bowls, even my good aluminum bowls. The only bowl that won't mark, is a glass bowl, and I don't like using glass.  I highly recommend."
"These are my favorite thing in the kitchen right now! I LOVE THESE BOWLS. They look beautiful and the grips are amazingly strong. They clean up so easily and are dishwasher safe. I've put them in a few times and they still look amazing. I do hand wash them a lot as well, just so I won't wear them out in the dishwasher. The sizes are perfect for everything you'd need to mix or marinate."
"I only have one set of stacking bowls and they are all ceramic. Nice for presentation, but not nice for getting down and dirty with one of my many baking projects. My ceramic bowls are all chipped now from using them for this purpose, so I finally caved and invested in these bowls which are PERFECT for baking(or cooking...).  I logged into Amazon and searched for stacking bowls. I picked these ones because I know OXO creates quality products. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with these. They arrived packaged very well and the size of all 3 of them is perfect for all my baking needs.  I love the easy pour spout on the side and the rubber bottoms while help them to stay put when I'm using my mixer and doing some aggressive stirring. I love these and am sad I didn't purchase them sooner."
"I'm a big fan of OXO-brand kitchen tools, and these bowls did not disappoint me! Their best features are the rounded non-slip rubber-lined bottom, the rubber hand grip conveniently built into one side of the rounded lip of the bowl, and the bowl's sturdy light-weight plastic construction (which is also stain resistant and easy to clean in soapy water). These features are a real benefit for us older folks whose hands are not as strong and steady as they once were. I am also a bit clumsy in the kitchen and am prone to knocking bowls and other breakable containers onto the floor. That's no longer a concern with the bowls' rubber-lined bottoms: they tend to stay put on tiled, wooden, and fabric-covered surfaces. One cautionary note: OXO recommends that these bowls should NOT be used in a microwave oven, lest the rubber and plastic bits melt or delaminate from one another."
"I absolutely LOVE these mixing bowls. I've pretty much stuck with ceramic or glass mixing bowls for my cooking/baking needs but was looking for something a little lighter. These are WONDERFUL. I wish I'd gotten them years ago. These come in three sizes so you can adjust as needed, depending on the size of your recipe. They have a nice spout for cleaner pouring. I like the ""lip"" with a rubberized grip for easy handling and that rubber-lined bottom keeps them from slipping on the countertop. I haven't run them through the dishwasher, but so far these clean up really well with a good rinse in the sink."
"When the rheumatologist gives you the diagnosis of arthritis, they should automatically hand you these bowls. I had the pretty set of red, orange, yellow, blue, green something that were nice looking. BUT they were heavy as lead. It became harder and harder to lift these up to store on the shelf or get them down to use. Just washing them was a pain!! Then I found these wonderful, useful, PEFECT bowls. They are light, but not flimsy, have a nice easy-grip handle part, a sturdy rubber bottom to keep from slipping, a pour spout and best of all - They are only three. I don't need anymore than that. I really don't think anyone does. These are OXO which is a good brand. Intelligent design but never have I found one of their products so perfect for me. I love them. Have thrown the dog off the bed and each night lovingly tucked these in beside me. These are wonderful bowls. Good buy."
My Dad had these bowls at his house and when I moved into my apartment I kept thinking about them whenever I cooked. I luckily was able to find them. They are awesome and easy to clean and store since they stack together. They also have a spout to pour thing. Dishwasher safe as well. Very sturdy.
"I was very hesitant about this purchase initially because the reviews were mixed and I wasn’t sure about the brand. But I am beyond happy with them. They are so cute and the sizes are amazing. I seem to find a use for each one. And they’re easy to clean and store. They’re also super durable, I thought the plastic would be flimsy but it isn’t at all."
"They're nothing to look at--the dull colors are decidedly 1970s--but they are highly functional. The non-slip bottom works very well. The non-slip handle on the lip allows you to hold the bowl steady or turn it as needed. The spout makes emptying batter easy and precise. The bowls themselves are thick enough that they should hold up to anything. I'll store them out of sight, but they make me happy every time I bring them out to use."
"These are perfect for all sorts of usages! I use them for mixing, for pouring hot liquids into, for marinating, etc, and they hold well, don't get deformed, and don't stain/smell. I've also used them in the microwave and stuck them in the dishwasher and they're all good.  Update: you're not supposed to put these in the microwave, I learned that about these bowls. Nothing has happened in the few times I put them in but now I avoid it. It's a shame because there are many times when I forget only to have to move it to another bowl for warming up. I wonder what makes this not suitable for microwaves..."
"These bowls are exactly what I needed. The rubber grip on the bottoms keep the bowls stable on the counter or table. The rubber grip handles give me a comfortable, easy grip. The bowls are really smooth, which makes for easy stirring and amazingly quick cleanup. The colors are gorgeous! The picture doesn't do them justice. They also come in perfect sizes. I've had the bowls about a month and have found repeated uses for all three.  Since storage space is always at a premium, I put these right on top of my microwave and under the cabinet. They're so attractive that they look great there, and are always available to grab quickly.  I often use one of the bowls as a ""garbage bowl"" when I'm working with meats, fruits, or veggies. I put the good stuff in one or two, and the extra fat, leaves, pits, or whatever else I'm dealing with in the other. I tip the garbage bowl over the garbage or compost pot and everything slides right in. A quick 5 second washup later, the mess is gone.  My mom recently commented that she doesn't visit kitchen stores any longer because she pretty much as everything she needs. I realized she has a good point. I, too, have everything I need. Sometimes, though, someone comes out with something so useful and so great looking that you just have to make the change from the old to the new.  As for the price, these are really reasonable. I love OXO, they've really won my loyalty."
"So-o many reasons I love this set of mixing bowls. It really is sturdy and holds up well and it is lightweight, making it easy to handle. I have used the smaller bowl for mixing pancakes each morning. The spout makes that job easier. I have used mine for over a year and have had NO problems or concerns. I purchased this set recently as a gift to 'spread my joy'!"
"I found these by accident and am so glad I did. These bowls have a rubberized nonslip bottom making them safe on the counter while mixing and stirring. This is especially useful if both your hands are needed on a mixer and a spatula. Also I feel much safer with my 10 yr old using them. I feel they are safer they won't slide off the counter and I can turn my back briefly without worries. I love the pour spout. I also like the light weight and color of the plastic. I find this brand in particular has many useful items for my kitchen. My only hesitation is I don't know if they are dishwasher safe. I never looked. But, I still recommend them for all the reasons I listed. I guess if the dishwasher use was a question I'd contact OXO but haven't so I guess for me it's not that important. I hand wash them in the sink."
"This set of bowls arrived today in just 4 days! They appear to be very durable and the colors are really nice. They are also easy to handle and the rubber handles and bottoms are just great. The larger one seems like it will be just perfect for my cake batter. The smallest one just perfect for eggs or sauces. Also like the non slip bottoms. Glad that i read the reviews because I was reluctant to purchase them at first but the reviews were all so positive.l Also the price is nice for a product of this quality. Thinking about getting other sets for gifts:) It says dishwasher safe but i will not be putting these in the dishwasher. It also recommends that they not be put in the microwave. Thanks Amazon  I have been using these bowls for a few months now and they are just as colorful and nice as the day they arrived. Also they are super easy to clean(still not putting in dishwasher). Very durable. I had noticed that one of the reviewers said that they scratch easily, but I have not had a problem. Have used plastic as well as metal utensils on them without a problem."
"We have been looking for bowls like these for a long time. We could find them with a pour spout but without the rubberized handle and bottom, but we couldn't find any like these. The blue one is large enough to mix up enough batter for pancakes for 3 hungry adults. Batter and cake mix pours easily and doesn't make a mess other than a small drip. The green bowl is big enough for cake mix for a 13""x9"" pan. The beige bowl is really big and not a bit unweildy. I have small hands and can easily lift these lightweight bowls and pour the entire contents into pans. It's really handy when using a handmixer and stirring the sides of the bowl at the same time. The rubberized bottom stays put on my countertops instead of sliding in circles. I don't get batter all over my hands because the rubberized bowl grip is easy to hang onto without having to put my fingers inside the bowl. My husband really loves these bowls too. He's the weekend chef in the house and has broken my glass bowls before. No worries with these and they're dishwasher safe, although I hand wash them."
"Before I ordered this set, I almost ordered the 3 piece speckled set, but some Amazon reviewers said that melamine set broke! So I went to the OXO Good Grips instead and here are the advantages of this set:  1) The sizes are perfect for everyday uses: Small (1 1/2 qt) Medium (3 qt) and Large (5 Qt)  2) Each bowl has a heavy non-slip bottom that grips a table or counter-top PERFECTLY!  3) Love the 5 Qt LARGE bowl for mixing a double batch of cupcakes for Pot-Luck or outings that I attend.  4) All 3 bowls make great popcorn bowls, depending on how large of the microwave popcorn you make, these bowls work great. And they make great serving bowls and mixing bowls.  5) I placed one of these in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and it did great, but I would not recommend longer than 2 minutes as these are not really microwave safe bowls.  6) Love the pours spouts on each bowl, great for pouring cake batter into a pan.  The only con is no covers. However, I use aluminum foil to cover these for the fridge. **These bowls are worth every cent I paid. Love them!"
"I purchased these bowls in 2013, and they still look almost brand new! I was just telling my husband how I love OXO products, so I decided to look at my order history and write a view on these bowls. They are lightweight and sturdy. They are the absolute best mixing bowls. I think everyone should have a set!"
"Terrific bowls, 3 great sizes, very durable and easy to clean. They don’t seem to scratch like other plastic bowls. Very happy, as usual, with OXO products."
"I absolutely love this mixing bowl set. Coming from someone who hated to cook/bake, this means a lot! After purchasing this set, I've been baking a lot more. Recently I made a mille-crepe cake for my wife AND banana bread! All because I love using this mixing bowl set! It is so sturdy, and I really like the rubberized grip at the bottom because it keeps the mixing bowls steady while you're trying to whisk. We use a silicone whisk, so we don't have issues with scratches as some of the other reviewers have mentioned when using a metal whisk. It washes easily as well. All in all, what a great purchase. I'm really glad we invested in these and threw out the IKEA set we had."
"Exactly as advertised. I wish they were all smaller. 1 qt. 2 qt. And 3 quarts. I am buying plastic because they are lightweight. It’s much easier for me to lift these, with my arthritis. I imagine many people order these bowls for the same reason. Being retired, our children are long grown and we cook much less. So, we don’t need such BIG mixing bowls. I’ve had to store the 5 qt. Bowl. I doubt that I ever use it. I’m hoping that Oxo will take this into account. Maybe Oxo would sell the 2 smaller bowls as a set?"
"I've never actually had mixing bowls before and since my husband and I are trying to cook at home more we've had to stock up on more kitchen products. I didn't really think that a mixing bowl would be that important until I tried using some that weren't so good. There are two things that make this mixing bowl stand out to me. First is the non skid bottom. It really stays put so you can mix without having to hold the bowl in place. The second feature is the spout on each bowl, which makes it easy and clean to pour stuff from the mixing bowl. Sometimes I make homemade yogurt, which involves whisking milk in a mixing bowl and then pouring it into containers. Without the pour spout it's a very messy process (for me, at least) but these bowls ensure that I don't spill anything. The big bowl is huge, I'm not sure we'll ever even use it but better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. I will probably order another in the small size since we use that one the most. My husband does with that they were microwaveable, but apart from that they are perfect."
"I LOVE this set of mixing bowls. Never thought I would be so exuberant about mixing bowls but there you have it. The ""non-skid"" bottom keeps the bowl in place on the counter while you're mixing so no accidents with the bowl slipping out from under you and the contents winding up everywhere. The sizes are very ""useable"". I bought the set specifically for the large bowl which easily holds the large amount of batter I prepare for a very large bundt cake. The ""pouring spout"" insures your batter winds up in the cake pan and not all over the counter. The ""easy-grip"" handle-like edge gives you a solid non-slippery area to hold onto when mixing and when pouring. These bowls are solid but not heavy and I expect them to last a good long time. They arrived in the expected time frame and the packaging was intact. I HIGHLY recommend these bowls."
"We absolutely love these bowls! The only thing I could add to the other reviews is the benefits of having these when cooking with children. As a mother of five, I have many eager helpers. The grip on the bottom of the bowls allows them to do more on their own, feeling more confident in their contribution. It also frees up my hands to assist with other things while they mix."
These are sturdy well built bowls. They are weighted on the bottom with a rubber bottom. This way if you bump the bowl it is not going to go sliding off the counter. The sizes are just perfect. I love the handle also. It is so nice to have the handle to hold onto when whipping or beating things in the bowl.
"I've had these bowls for about a month now and I use them nearly every day. I am very impressed with the quality, especially the bottoms of the bowl (on the underside). In the past, I've has white plastic bowls that always developed hairline cracks on the bottom, and beads of water would begin to seep out, so I had to discard the bowls. These bowls have a black rubber-like surface on the bottom which helps keep them from sliding around on the work surface, and which I also hope will keep them from developing the cracks I've become used to with other bowls."
I bought the 3-piece set for my daughter for Christmas. She had it on her Amazon wishlist and was absolutely thrilled with it! I know it surpassed her expectations. The bowls are a very nice quality and a nice weight with a rubberized bottoms to keep them from slipping around on the counter when you are stirring or adding ingredients to them. They have an easy to grip handle and pour spout. The colors are soft and neutral and would match most decors easily. I think I'm a little jealous of her mixing bowls and may have to see is Santa will bring me some next year! I highly recommend these mixing bowls!
"These are stackable so don't waste space in the cabinet. I was looking for mixing bowls that had a pourable lip, and these fit my needs perfectly. They are sturdy and have a good weight to them, and the rubber bottom helps keep them in place on my counter when I am mixing. The colors are nice, too. Another dependable OXO product."
"I've always used glass mixing bowls (and I love them) but found as I am getting older that holding them steady while mixing can sometimes be difficult. Went looking for bowls that would be a little lighter and more manageable for me, and luckily found these! To get three high quality bowls for this price is a terrific bargain. The grips on the bottom keep the bowl securely on the counter. The hand grips are very comfortable and make it easy to pick up the bowl without having to either use both hands or have your thumb over the lip of the bowl. Easy to clean as well. Very happy!"
"These bowls are of great quality and are very convenient. The largest bowl, however, is slightly too large in my opinion for our family.  These bowls are easy to clean and the soft handles make these bowls very easy to hold in place. The non slip bottom is also a great plus preventing them from slipping and sliding while in use. One thing we are worried about is using metal equipment with these bowls as we think they may scratch and discolor the insides of them, so we have stuck to using wooden spoons with these bowls.  Overall, we have put the small and medium bowls to a lot of use. The larger bowl is a bit too large in my opinion so we have yet to find some use for it. This may be different for other buyers but even only using two bowls, this purchase was definitely worth the money."
Perfect addition to my kitchen. The non-skid bottoms and the non-skid handles allow you to whisk away without having the bowl fly away. They are lightweight and yet not flimsy. And they are very easy to clean. Buy them now. You won't regret your purchase.
"It was so great to get bowls that matched instead of my assortment of colors, materials and shapes. These help me minimize my kitchen while having what I need on hand. They are good for mixing or serving (potato chips for ex.) and I am more than pleased at the weight of them. They stay put on the counter while I'm working. I couldn't be happier."
"These are beautiful, the colors are pleasing, and the bowls are just the right weight and size. I needed to change to a really light weight set of bowls for my baking: like others I have found the tried and true Pyrex bowls are just too heavy for my senior shoulders and wrists. I looked at all the plastic and metal bowls that are available. I nixed several because they were flimsy, or had a design that would hurt your hands. I settled on the OXO because of the shape, and the sizes of the bowls. The fact that they looked like someone took the time to actually think about the ergonomics of handling and pouring batter from these bowls was worth the price. The rubber coating on the bottoms is sturdy and add alot to the stability when using a hand mixer. This has a pouring spout, and the sizes are just right at 1 1/2, 3 and 5 quart."
"This is a great set of nesting mixing bowls. They hold up well in my house to running through the dishwasher and all the other abuses they've encountered. Lots of craft and cooking projects. They clean up easily and nest nicely in the drawer I keep them in. It's a good set of sizes, and the grippy bottom is nice, especially when my 5 year old is helping me in the kitchen. I like that they've got the little rubber area for gripping and the pour spout. Great set, highly recommend."
I had a set of 4 melamine bowls that I have had for years. In the last year or so I have dropped 2 of them (the 2 sizes I used the most). When they hit the ceramic floor they exploded into hundreds of pieces. So I needed replacement bowls. These OXO bowls are the perfect size for everything I need mixing bowls for. I love the fact that don't slip around on the surface that I am working on. They stay in one spot. I also love the handle. It makes it so easy to move contents out of the bowl.
"This is one of those things that has features that you wouldn't know you needed until you experience it. I had never thought about my mixing bowls (which have always been plain and cheap) as they did what I thought they should do. These bowls, however, raise the bar. I love the non-slip bottom and the side grip. The pour spout is also really handy and I like how the shape of the bowl is tilted. These bowls are really high quality and I like that they're deep. The only thing I'm not happy about is that it says that they are not microwave safe- that could be an issue but I'll just have to work around it. I still have a couple of cheap bowls if I really need to put it in the microwave. Regardless, these are great bowls and I am thrilled that I splurged and bought them."
"Love these bowls. I have a few sets of mixing bowls, I have a bakery. These are new for me and feel very sturdy. The colors are pretty darned close to what is shown and match the decor of my kitchen very well.  The large bowl holds 6 lbs of bread dough (I know because it is always full of refrigerated artisan dough!) and the other two are great mid and small/mid size for most kitchen tasks. The grip on the edge is a really handy thing and I love the non skid bottoms! (Mind, they will mark your butcher block counters! II would only love them more, like 10 starts worth, if they had lids!"
"Love these bowls. Non-slip bottom & handle makes a great replacement for some old, inherited, colored-glass bowls. Have used them twice since receiving a couple of weeks ago & am very pleased w the quality & size. I nearly dropped a 4 qt glass bowl & decided that even though I loved their old-timey look, I didn’t love their old-timey slippery-ness (& would’ve been upset had it actually made it to the floor, as they belonged to my mother). I also like that my hand mixer doesn’t mar the bottom, like it does the glass."
I bake a lot around the holidays and this year found myself annoyed by having to constantly wash bowls and measuring cups/spoons in order to move on to the next recipe. We decided to purchase more of each since we have the room for it. When I saw these I knew I'd get them as I already have them in white and LOVE them. They are the perfect bowl for anything and I love that I can use my hand mixer with it and it doesn't make me worry about chipping a glass bowl. Perfect for any home baker or chef!
"I love these mixing bowls. They're the perfect weight. The rubber on the bottom is fantastic, helps keep the bowls from sliding all over the counter top. The colors are nice, they stack beautifully inside one another. I'm so glad I purchased these over glass pyrex bowls...these are SO much lighter, and much easier to use.  I do with that we could use them in the microwave, but the quality of these bowls makes up for it. Also, I tend to hand wash the largest bowl by hand since it won't fit on the top rack of the dishwasher. I'm sure it'd be fine on the bottom since I never use heat to dry my dishes....better safe than sorry and if all I have to wash at dinner is one big bowl, I'm doing great!  Definitely recommend!"
"I actually have two sets of these bowls, but NOT because one set gave way-because I loved the first set so much, I got a 2nd! They're extremely sturdy, the rubber bottoms mean there's a lot of great traction for mixing things, they easily hold soups, cookie dough, cake batter, you can put mashed potatoes in them, pasta, etc. They hold their shape beautifully, they don't wither, they don't pucker, they're just fantastic bowls all around! I HIGHLY recommend these bowls to anyone that cooks a lot in their kitchens!"
"These are great. I only wish I had bought them sooner - makes it so much easier to get them in and out of the low cabinet where I must keep them. I hadnt realized how very heavy my stonewear bowls were until I got these. If anyone has a grandma who's kitchen bowls need replacing these would make a great gift. I also got the white one with the markings on the inside. They are stable on the counter and are easy to wash, and can be put on the top shelf of the dishwasher if they fit. Time alone will tell how well they wear but so far, so good. This brand has won lots of points with me over the years and I feel confident when I buy one of their products. These have not disappointed."
"Bought these for my wife after seeing her struggle with a bowl that just moved around too much when she was mixing cooking dough. After using them for the first time she told me unequivocally that she loves them! They were easy to handle, the non-skid bottom made a huge difference, she loved the non-slip handle, and they are easy to clean. Can't say enough good about them!"
"This purchase was made, due to an increasingly-painful issue of arthritis in my hands. I'm no longer able to hold onto heavy stoneware mixing bowls or slippery stainless steel. These bowls not only met my needs, but coming from a company like Oxo, I knew they would be well-made and last a long time. In addition to being perfect for all my mixing needs, these bowls are bright and decorative! You just can't beat that combination! I highly recommend these mixing bowls to anyone, but especially to others like me who have arthritis or weakness in their hands. I use many of the Oxo products, and LOVE them!"
I had a set of these in the white for several years but felt like I needed more bowls. I've tried various other types but these have always been my favorite. I was completely sold on getting a second set after Binging with Babish mentioned that these were also his favorite bowls.
"I needed a big mixing bowl and headed to Amazon to find one. I looked at literally every big mixing bowl and found the single big white bowl of this set first. Then I found this set and decided to buy the set for about $10.00 more than just just the big single one. I guess if you could call a set of mixing bowls impressive it would be this set. My set arrived two days ago, and I have already used both the big and medium sized bowls. They are extremely well made and have a hard rubber bottom which means the bowls don't slide around when you are trying to mix in them. I have several OXO kitchen products, and they just make the best stuff. These bowls are no exception. I am very pleased with my purchase."
"These mixing bowls are well made and will last a long lime. The entire bottom of the bowl is non-skid, instead of just a non skid ""ring"" that can come loose eventually. The pouring spout works OK. My only comment is that the largest bowl is really too big, and does not fit in my refrigerator."
"I had another brand of mixing bowls (Faberware) that had a non-skid ring at the bottom that kept popping off and after two years cracked where you hold them. So far, I like this brand and they feel solid and hopefully will last for some time!"
"Really easy to use. The non-slip bottom and side handles really make a difference and are very effective. I particularly like the variety of colors these come in much better than a standard white.  These bowls feel solid without being too heavy. They look nice enough to be used as serving bowls for pot-lucks and so on. The 3 different sizes have worked out well for me, finding uses for each of the sizes.  I've very pleased with this purchase. In fact, a number of people have asked about these, where I got them, how much they cost, etc. That is not a question I usually get about something as simple as a bowl."
"My fiance ordered these for me as a gift. I have horrible mixing bowls and really needed new ones. These are some sturdy bowls. I set the yellow big bowl on the counter and turned around, forget it was there and knocked it. It didn't even budge !! These things hold their own up well. The grips are super nice. You can hold any of the bowls and they stay in your grip. Arthritis patients can really use these with no struggle. I love the colors and how durable they are. I wish everyone had a set of these."
I bought these a long time ago. I love the rubber bottoms.. They don't slide when mixing ingredients. They nestle perfectly. You are really missing out if you don't buy these. They have been the most over used dish in my kitchen.
"These bowls are a bit brighter than shown on Amazon. They shine in truly glorious colors perfect for counter top display. I accidentally discovered that the 5 quart white bowl makes a great dishpan in my sink,leaving space for rinsing and other tasks. But, it didn't seem wise to reuse the same for measuring nor mistake one white bowl for another. Thus I got the set with colors as an addition. These are of excellent quality plastic, stack neatly, and should, like their white counterparts, give years of use. The largest bowl is about 11"" in diameter and 5 1/2 in height. The green is almost as tall and, of course, the blue one nestles inside it. Couldn't be more pleased."
"Nothing better. Nothing sticks. These are sturdy, with great slip resistance on a counter. Aliens will surely come to Earth to steal this technology."
"These are the best mixing bowls! I bought them because they were recommended by America's test kitchen. They haven't let me down yet! They are easy to hold on to, the bowl stays put when you are mixing, and the bowl comes clean easily when you pour out your batter. I use these bowls constantly and they are holding up great. Only one thing I will caution against: Don't use a metal pastry knife to cut butter/shortning into flour in this bowl! I made that mistake once and it roughed up the inside of one of these bowls so it is no longer a smooth surface. MY BAD!"
I used these bowls for the first time to make potato salad. Five pounds of cooked potatoes fit in the medium bowl to cool and it was a breeze to easily mix the salad in the large bowl. The rubber grip handle and non skid bottom are great features. I'm sure I'll love the pouring spout when I make batter. The bowls were also very easy to clean up. I highly recommend this product.
"These bowls are a kitchen staple. The shape is generous and easy to work with, the rubberized bottom is lovely, and in white or multicolor, they look great! Plus, Oxo is a great company and I feel confident that I'll be using these for decades to come."
"I love these mixing bowls!! OXO is a quality company with good, well made products and these bowls are no different. Good range of bowl sizes, very easy to clean and they do not slide around at all during use. I highly recommend this product."
"I don’t know how much there actually is to say about mixing bowls, but I do love the fact that they have a rubber base and rubber along the edge, so no matter how aggressively I am mixing or whisking, they don’t tip over or go sliding around the counter. I can also have water or whatever on my hands and because of the rubber grip on the edge, the bowl never slips out of my hand."
"I really enjoy how light weight and easy to clean these are, they are sturdy on any surface and I love the spout for easy pouring, they are dishwasher safe also which is REALLY nice. I would recommend these 100%"
These are great! I just used the medium sized one to make cookies. I only have a hand mixer so this was exactly what I needed. It make it really easy to hold and the fact that it's also grippy at the bottom means that this thing really didnt budge when I was using the mixer in it. I also like the colors because most plastic kitchen stuff is way too brightly colored and honestly looks tacky.
"These Bowls are THE best. I have owned a set of these for a few years myself and gifted this purchase to my mother at Christmas. What a difference from using any other bowls. Rubber on the bottom of the bowl makes them nice and grippy when mixing on a counter. Great handle to hold onto also has rubber. These are the best bowls I have ever used. I have had many, these are the best."
"These bowls are *chefs kiss* amazing. Nothing sticks to them, they have rubber on the bottom, so they don't slip around, and the handle is covered in the same rubber, so they don't slip out of your hand."
"I purchased this 3 piece set to downsize from the heavy Pyrex glass mixing bowls. I am very satisfied with these bowls so far. I love the colors, and the bowls hold quite a bit more than you would anticipate. I was concerned going from a 8 pc glass set to this 3 pc and this set covers all my needs. The non skid bottoms are great, especially when using a hand mixer. My favorite feature has to be the spout-no more spilling transferring!"
"I really needed bowls in these three sizes and am so happy with their good quality feel. I have arthritis in my hands and wrists, so the light weight and padded holding area makes mixing and pouring so much easier. They are not for microwave use, but I do not mind melting ingredients in a different dish, as the rubberized bottom and handle are worth the trade-off. They would probably be fine in the dishwasher, but so far I have not tried that washing method. The colors illustrated are a bit different in reality. The blue and green are both deeper shades, and the yellow is truly yellow, not cream as shown."
"I was looking to replace my 12 cup Rubbermaid mixing bowl when I found these. They ended up being better than I had expected. They're sturdy, and the non-slip bottoms grip well. I was concerned that the handles would be awkward, but I find that they are very convenient to use and make storing the set easy too. The yellow bowl is bigger than what I found in other sets and is great for making double batches of cookies. My niece is getting married this fall and I'm thinking of getting her a set as a shower gift. The only things that I would change are the colors. If the whole set was blue, like the small bowl, they'd be perfect."
"I wish I had known about these bowls long ago. They are wonderful. They are deep enough for using a hand mixer in them without making a mess. I have never been able to find a bowl large enough for a 10"" deep dish apple pie - the large one holds everything! I was a bit skeptical about putting them in the dishwasher, but they are in there several times a week and come out looking new. I have only had them several months, but they get a workout at my house! I am so thankful every time I use them. They are light weight - wonderful for people with arthritis and they don't slide around the counter top."
Very sturdy and obviously well made. Better than I expected from a brand that usually makes mid-range kitchen accessories. Heavy plastic and the rubber handle and base are very firmly attached. Perfect range of sizes and of course they nest together neatly for storage. Definitely hand wash because a dishwasher will dry out the rubber over time. I got the blue/green/yellow set and they're nice colors without being obnoxiously bright.
These are made well. I love it’s made of natural products. They are easy clean up. Always being used in way or another
We needed some bowls that were deeper to avoid spills(kids eat a lot of cereal) These definitely are perfect for that. Sturdy and easy to clean.
"I like these. Needed new cereal bowls for the kids, these are easy. Throw right in the dishwasher. They are solid and not flimsy at all. Wish there were marching plates and cups"
"These stain with products like hot sauce and take multiple washes to really get that color out. If you are eating oily foods this may not be the best, but for cereal or non oily foods they are great."
"Good bowls! They do the job easy to clean dish washer safe . Haven't tried them in the Microwave, I don't microwave plastic so don't know about that ."
We wanted to have bowls that were lightweight but durable and microwave safe. These fit the bill! Cute colors too. Great purchase.
Very happy with these bowls. Colors are great. They wash up very easy. Perfect size bowl.
"I needed these bowls for eating soups and cereal. I had none. They are exactly what I need. Durable, dishwasher safe and microwave safe. A real ""life-saver"" for me."
"Speedy delivery. Nice bowls, easy to clean, pretty durable. Light weight, what I needed as I get older."
Perfect size for my needs
"This is really not a cereal bowl, IMO. It’s more of a snack serving bowl or storage bowl. It’s too deep and big for cereal. Other than that, it’s very good and will probably last a long time."
"What’s not to like. Just as advertised, works in microwave."
"I thought they’d be bigger, but actually it will help me to eat less. Well maybe…still nice bowls"
Wash well. Cute colors.
Borscht couldn't stain these. We all know beats stain like...beats.
"Very nice bowls. They are easy to clean, microwaveable, durable and perfect for popcorn, a nice salad, soup or salad."
"Sturdy, nice colors, and love that they can go in the microwave and dishwasher"
Love These Bowls
These are perfect cereal bowls for kids and look great too. Got compliments on the “ombre” blue colors!
i bought these for my camper and live them
Love the colors. And quality.
Versatility
Very nice quality! They are sturdy and are our new perfect cereal bowls!
I liked the fact I could get cute microwaveable bowls & dishwasher safe!
"I 💙❤️ These bowls! They are sturdy, durable and dishwasher safe."
Love the bowls!
"I like the idea they are microwave and dishwasher safe but very disappointing that after the first use they are stained. I selected this product due to the description stating you could serve PASTA, soup or cereal. Obviously you cannot serve pasta in these bowls. Very disappointing they are ruined already."
Perfect size for a bowl of cereal. Deep enough
Very sturdy and easy to clean
"These hold a lot! You can easily fit a whole can of soup without worrying about spilling. They've been great for cereals, salad, soup and so easy to clean. No staining from tomato soup like plastic does."
Beautiful colors. However a little smaller than I hoped.
"I like the fact that they don't heat up in the microwave. Nice quality, nice colors, quick delivery,"
"The bowls were good for what we wanted them for.....cooking in microwave, soup and breakfast food."
"Great for cereal and soup, like that they're a deeper bowl"
Everything
Nice looking
Great bowls!
They are microwavable.
I like everything about the bowls but the chilly stains were hard to get off the bowl
I like the fact they don’t get too hot when heated in microwave
good
They look great! Have been through the dishwasher and microwave so many times and great. Perfect for soup and cereal!
Cute perfect regular every day bowls! Love them!
They are great so far work great in microwave and wash just fine.
Bought these for cereal and they're fine. Maybe a little lightweight but they'll work
I'll still use these blue colored bowls but when cooking soup etc they get hot at the bottom which makes them a challenge to carry. I feel challenged.
Love the products ❤️❤️
"These are ok. Not what I expected, they are flexible to a point. Was hoping they would be more sturdy."
come as describe. I have used them in the microwave without issue and cleaned them in the dishwasher without issue. Reasonably priced!
"Great bowls, do what they say. However, the very first time I used tomato soup in them, they stained. Now there's a permanent orange look to the inside where the soup was. Near impossible to remove the stains."
The bowls don't break
Easy to clean
A little cheaper than I thought they’d be. Lightweight but OK.
"Don't bother, kids drop them and they break, put it in the dishwasher, it breaks. VERY difficult to clean, worthless product."
Bowl stained to easy can't wash it out .
Size is good. But takes hot water and good dish detergent for bowls to feel clean.
"Bought them for my husband, who is a senior. They are great. A perfect size, he can handle them very easily, and they go in top of dishwasher. Would certainly recommend them."
Love the Bowls perfect for my seven-year-old son who thinks it’s OK to drop bowls off the table here and there well at least now they don’t break
"I impulse bought these for my kid’s college dorm. She loves them! She says they are easy to clean, nice size for ramen and oatmeal. She loves the ombré colors!"
These are great bowls. We love these for everyday use and they are very sturdy.
"Nice size, easy to clean, nice and sturdy and the colors are appealing."
It was easy to use.
Lighter weight than expected. Clean up well.
"Just what I was looking for. I wanted something that wouldnt stain, break, and was easy to clean. So far they’ve been perfect and I love the speckled look."
"I've only used two of the bowls, but they clean (hand wash) well,and microwave without issue."
"Purchased for microwaving high protein diet foods, and they work GREAT! They don’t get scalding hot, and they are really easy to clean after. Deep enough not to boil over easily, too!"
Simple clean and light!
"Great bowl for grandchildren. Popcorn,cereal etc. pretty colors."
Iike. bowls light weight and large will order more
A little deeper than I would like but nice.
Told my daughter who is 17 that they are unbreakable this girl through this on to ground before I could say not too. Not in a soft fashion full on I am going to prove my father wrong. Did not break or even scuff. Even after chasing her around the house pelting her with it no breaky. I will update after we have tried the bat.
"Site says microwave safe. Wrong. Bowls are disintegrating in the microwave. Clear, small, linear strings are falling off the bowls when used in the microwave."
"We love these bowls. They are so durable! We have four kids (4-13) and these bowls have been dropped, washed, microwaved, used for hot an cold things, and they still look amazing! Definitely recommend."
The bowl started peeling after getting hot.
"The size of these bowls are perfect. Most bowls are pretty small, but these are perfect for soups, chili, and breakfast cereal. I have to hand wash my dishes and these clean up very easily, and are not breakable. I liked them so much I ordered 2 sets."
"It says microwave safe, but this is what happened when I microwaved food for 3min.. it melted!!"
Too small and not safe in microwave You can buy at Walmart for 50 cents and microwave safe
"I am delighted with the quality and size of these environmentally-friendly bowls. They are perfect for cereal - the best bowl I've had in a while that holds my cereal, bananas (or other fruit) & plenty of milk without spilling. They are easy to clean and stack. I highly recommend these bowls. I ordered dishes to match, which I also like ... but I LOVE THESE BOWLS."
"I have used these bowls in my microwave many times and no problem. Since this is September 2021, wonder if they have improved them as many people said they were not microwave safe. Also I will store sauces with a tomato base in them in the freezer. When I go to wash them the coloring from the sauces completely comes off immediately unlike some plastic containers that always retain some of the sauce color. I recommend them highly"
"These are made of ""wheat starch"" and are biodegradable. They were even advertised as having a slight ""pleasant smell"" of wheat which I thought was weird. Someone even asked if they were gluten-free, LOL. Although I thought the idea was strange they have held up well so far after several weeks of washing them in the dishwasher. I imagine that I will get a few good years of use out of them. I bought them for prep bowls because I kept breaking my glass bowls and I was tired of cleaning up the mess. I have limited mobility in my right hand. This was a great solution. They are the right size for both prep and eating, and I like the muted colors."
"These are fantastic with a little bit of extra care. Very light compared to ceramic bowls--which get boiling hot while food is still cold. These don't get hot in the microwave as long as you don't go too long. I've done 2 minutes, stir the food and then another 30 to 60 seconds without issue. If one gets stained I just throw it out. After six months I haven't thrown any out despite putting pasta sauce or other food that stains."
"I make lots of homemade soups, 5 gallons at a time. We then freeze them in 2C containers and microwave them at our leisure. This is our primary use for these. Our past bowls were handled ceramics. They got very hot in the microwave and although they were ""microwave safe"" most of them cracked on us - just thawing and heating soup. These comments are based on this use.  Pros: * Don't heat up in the microwave, so unless your food gets hot enough to melt these, they will be great. * Because of the above, thick soups do not burn to the sides of the bowl while microwaving making cleanup SUPER easy. * They are super light. * They are great heat insulators, I can hold a bowl of soup that is too hot to eat. They get a little warm right where the soup is, but they have a little ridge around the bottom so when the soup is very hot, I can hold the bowl by the ridge and the rim. By the time it is edible, the entire bowl is cool to the touch. * They seem pretty strong. * Inexpensive - always a plus. * Good enough that I already bought 8 more ;-)  Cons: *They look like cheap plastic. Not really a con since you can see what they look like on the picture, but I would love to find some nicely designed bowls made out of this material."
"No, this is not a Megadeth review. This is my bowl review. Bowl is very lightweight and somewhat flexible. while I had my reservations about this bowl when I first received it, it does what I need it to do. That is, warm up my oatmeal or soup here at work. I am a New England clam chowder guy, and you all know how that stuff can cling to and burn a plastic dish, specially when not cooked properly. Anyway, this dish had no problems warming up my soup in the microwave here at work. When used properly in the microwave to warm up soup, it handles that job perfectly."
"After breaking a very large glass plate and cleaning up tiny bits of glass for days afterward, I decided to transition to something other than glass. These bowls fit the bill perfectly. Now, I don't have to worry about broken glass. They are lightweight yet very sturdy. They hold quite a bit of food. They are also easy to clean. I purchased the matching plates to go with them a few days later as I was so pleased with the bowls. Oh, and they arrived super fast. There are matching glasses that you can purchase separately or you can buy the whole set of plates, bowls, and glasses, including table utensils (knives, spoons and forks of the same material), together. I think that you'll like them as much as I do. I'm going to order the matching glasses."
"I was using dollar store ceramic/glassware as my primary food service stuff, themselves an upgrade from paper plates which made every meal seem like a picnic, indoors, with the shades drawn, eating by monitor-light.  Eventually I realized that if I drop these things - AGAIN - it will be a huge pain, so I looked for an alternative to the bowls. I found these, and they seem great. Microwave safe, dishwasher safe, solid and secure enough, easy to clean, and so on.  Decent price too."
"I made an egg in one in the microwave this morning, perfect size for a bagel sandwich. I made crab salad in one for lunch. They're the perfect size for single meals, clean easily and don't heat up in the microwave. They will transfer heat from the cooked item, but the top of the bowl is easily in an acceptable temperature range after cooking."
"OMG sometimes things aren’t what you like when buying from the internet. This is not the case with this company. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I needed outdoor dishes for my Lanai here in Hawaii & the pictures don’t do these products justice. So pleased with all of their products. I ordered the bowls, plates, utensils appetizer plates & the cups. I will be ordering again Love love love these products!! Thanks so much"
"These bowls are great! I've put them through their paces, both in the microwave and dishwasher. They seem as perfect as when I unboxed them. Even oily salad dressing washes out easily, and cheese dip and marinara warmed in the microwave didn't stain them. I'm definitely happy with an eco friendly product that actually does a great job. Considering adding the plates and cups!"
"The bowl is sturdy and durable. I thought it would be some small, baby size bowl, but no its perfect portion controlled size. I could get a good bowl of cereal and milk in here. I'm mad it only comes with 4 for this price of $10, but I guess."
"Sturdy, ridiculous easy to clean (""impossible"" debris wipes right off with an hour soak). Unlike some other reviewers here, I *have* had success with these in the microwave - I've made oatmeal and spaghetti-o's innumerable times where the only problem is that the tomato sauce requires a soak to clean. There's literally nothing bad I can think of about these bowls."
"These bowls are very sturdy. I like these bowls a lot. My daughter cooked ravioli in a bowl in the microwave. It did leave a stain in the bowl originally but after several more uses and trips through the dishwasher I don't see the stain anymore and I don't even know which bowl it was. The bowls are a nice size, lightweight, easy to clean and I would definitely buy again."
""
"I don't know why, but we seem to go through ceramic and glass kitchenware. We were down down t one big cereal bowl and I ordered these. I love them. They have a nice feel to them, not plastic or cheap. I don't have any problem serving them to a guest. They clean easily. Actually, I wish that they were available in a larger size, for mixing and serving."
"These plates and bowls are so easy to clean. We love the plates, my 23 year old grandson who is on the autism spectrum and spills alot with regular plates, use this without spilling because of the big lips the plates have on them. He is very confident in these plate. The bowls for cereal and soup are very deep so less spills. These will not breah"
"I have been eating cereal and soup and other ""wet"" foods out of flat soup bowels all my life. They don't hold much,they spill easy, food gets cold quick. They don't work. I finally ordered these bowels. They are the right size, they don't tip all the time and food stays the right temperature. I love them and would highly recommend them."
"I love these bowls! if you never owned anything like them before, the feel will take a bit to get used to but in the end its worth it. You don't have to worry about them breaking, but yet they are a bit more studier then straight plastic. They wash easily in the dishwasher, big bonus. They are microwave safe, and they even come with a bonus cleaning sponge! I just ordered more to have on hand."
"Have had for 10 months. size and shape perfect. Wonderful for arthritic hands. pleasant colors. Sturdy, look like new after regular use. I have heated food in microwave, but not used for cooking stuff and have not had any melting or material shedding."
"My kid and her friends have a hard time remembering which plates I own are microwavable and which are not. So I decided to replace all the plates, bowls, etc in the house that ate not microwavable with these wheatgrass products. So far, I love them! These bowls have a slick inner surface which makes them easier to clean. Love the colors also. They are light weight, yet seem perfectly sturdy. Top notch product!"
"These are the best bowls I have ever used. I use them for everything. They do pick up a stain from sauce or chili if you microwave them, just like tupperware does, but they are super durable. They smell a little funky out of the box, but after a quick wash they are good to go. The colors arent obnoxious, and they hold quite a lot without feeling obstructively large."
I have not had the problem in the microwave that some people have. I like knowing that these safe for my kids to use. They are not flimsy like most of the plastic bowls we have used in the past and we are not getting led poisoning from ceramic bowls.
"Great for cereal! Bought to replace my husband's favorite cereal bowl! We find these nice a deep, great for cereal or a big bowl if chili! Cleansing well, doesn't stain easily. Holds up in the dishwasher!"
If kids are always breaking your bowls (or your clumsy husband) buy these they are just the right size for a cereal bowl. You can fill half way for kids and your husband can fill it all the way up. These are nice and clean up great in the sink or dishwasher
I bought these bowls to replace some plastic ones I have had for years. I was concerned about size and if they would stand up to using them in my microwave. The size is perfect for my morning cereal and they seem to be fine in the microwave. Only time will tell about the microwave.
These are great bowls. I was looking for something that was light weight and wouldn’t break if dropped. They clean easily and hold a lot. I’m even considering getting another set.
"These are indeed expensive, buuuuut worth it. I tossed all of my kids cheap plastic plates and bowls and replaced them with these because they kept trying to microwave on the thin plastic plates. They have held up great, cleaned well in the dishwasher, and survived the microwave on a few occasions. Highly recommended."
I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these bowls but was pleasantly surprised. They seem sturdy enough and clean and dry off easily. I don't have a dishwasher so they get hand-washed. They don't pass on any funny chemical-like tastes to the food and no odor. An excellent non-plastic alternative solution that won't take centuries to decompose in a landfill!
"Have had these bowls for about a year now and I have no complaints. They are sturdy, dishwasher and microwave safe and do not stain. Great item and I would buy again."
"I like that we can use these in the microwave. They're great for heating up leftovers or soups, also good for cold stuff. After several cycles through the dishwasher they're still holding up nicely with no staining (I enjoy tomato soup!), no cracks or anything else which would indicate poor quality. They're really nice bowls. The colors are nice too."
"I was unsure of what to expect from a bowl made of wheat. But I can confirm that they are durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I haven't tried them in the microwave. They are large and deep, perfect for cereal."
"Purchased these with the intent of using them in our camping trailer. We were looking for light and easy, and plates that would fit into the little sink in our Casita. These work perfectly! They clean easily and are big enough for our meals. Love the fact that they are eventually compostable! Can highly recommend."
"I keep chipping my glass bowls when washing dishes, so I decided to find bowls that won't break instead. These have worked fantastically! At first I thought the box was empty, these were so light. Will definitely purchase again when needed."
Have these for months. I don't use them in the dishwasher even though I read it's not plastic. I do use them in the microwave though. So I don't know lol. But can drop them from a high surface and don't break. Durable and light. Use them for my daughter
"We also have other products by this manufacturer and find all of them sturdy, dishwasher safe, and attractive. I highly recommend them. In fact, I give sets as gifts."
They may be smaller than expected but turned out to be the perfect size for noodles and soup. They are dishwasher and microwave safe which is a big plus. Great for kids since they are sturdy and can take a beating. Love them.
"The perfect bowl. I purchased these because ceramic cereal bowls were scratching my table. These bowls solved that, and more! The shape is perfect for keeping the cereal off the sides, making it easier for kids or challenged adults. These are cute, durable and easy to clean. I’m ordering more!"
"We just got these bowls in. I purchased them because we are hard on bowls and mugs, and I was down to two soup bowls. We already love them. They are lightweight, but they are sturdy, we've dropped one and it just spun around. They went through the microwave and dishwasher fine."
These are nice bowls. They appear to be unbreakable. They are also a bit smaller than I expected from the pictures from the seller.
We use these for our breakfast cereal and for dessert after our evening meal. The weight of these bowls make it easy to use while sitting outside and eating from them.
"good and usefull size ; beating 3 eggs for - - ,a bowl of cereal , waffle batter for 1 . and they don't break if you drop them."
Love these! Bought them because little kids and glass bowls don’t mix. And they are super cute. We all use them and will be getting more. My daughter heated up spaghetti and I thought that was the end of the bowl and it didn’t stain!
"Very nice, lightweight and the best thing is that they don't come out hot from the microwave! They hold just the right amount and are very pretty. The only thing I can't do is let my dog lick the bowl, she will try to eat it - So I guess I can say that the bowl seems ""tasty"" too."
"These bowls are super useful. Light and sturdy, they are used multiple times a day. In fact, they are the only bowls I use now. I liked these so much that I purchased a matching set of plates."
"These bowls are great. I bought them for use in my RV--lightweight, durable and safely microwaveable. I also like that it washes easily even if the food in it was greasy. Colors are very pretty too."
"My husband loves these bowls. They are lightweight, a nice size to hold soup with lots of crackers, and the bowls stay cool enough to hold onto. They can go in the dishwasher too!"
"I love the colors, they are easy to clean and go in the dishwasher, microwave. I bought these for cereal and a set in the same colors just a little larger for salads. I love them both. They are sturdy, easy to hold and easy to use and clean."
I got these for my grandchildren. I wanted something that was Microwave safe and unbreakable. These are perfect! I like them so much I ordered 2 more sets to use as salad bowls for family dinners.
These bowls come in cute colors and are very easy to clean. They are very lightweight which makes them easy to carry by my toddler but unbreakable for when he drops them! They are the perfect size for cereal or oatmeal in the mornings.
"Bought them and same glasses for when I go out of town, staying in hotel or camping. Very lightweight, microwaveable, clean easy and environmentally friendly."
"I purchased these bowls because I did not want to purchase plastic and I wanted something that was very versatile, that could be good for eating cereal, making salads, and heating up food in the microwave. They are also very easy to clean. I am very happy with these bowls"
"These haven't broken, biodegraded in my sink, chipped, discolored, or done anything but be good bowls. I'm a clumsy old person who drops things. These will outlast me. Then they can biodegrade."
I love these. I have sensory issues with people clanking utensils with plates and bowls and this has been a lifesaver from major stress.
"The bowls are very lightweight, can go in the microwave, but they don't get hot! They are also easy to wash whether by hand or in the dishwasher. I may replace all my china, melamie, plastic, etc. with wheatgrass products."
I have used these bowls for 2 years and they have worn well so I ordered another set. I like that they do not get really hot when microwaved. The size is also good for most needs.
These are very nice plastic bowls. The colors are really pretty and they wash well. Perfect size.
No complaints works well in the microwave Worth the money I paid will buy again if I need more bowls
"Love these bowls! I got a set of these for my rv to replace all the plastic and I'm so happy with them, they clean SO well, don't get hot to the touch in the microwave, are light weight and just plain cute. I completely recommend these to anyone!"
"These are the perfect size, deep bowl holds foods better than a regular cereal bowl. Sturdy, unbreakable when dropped. This is my second order. We use often, so 4 were not enough for the two of us! Thank you!"
"These bowls are great! Just the right size for cereal, soup, leftovers etc etc. Very sturdy and easy to clean. They do well in the dishwasher and microwave. Great seller too. Fast and thoughtful."
I love these! Have matching plates. Clean up good and look awesome. Easy to clean💥💥💥👍
"Very nice colors, go with anything, light weight and easy to clean"
A perfect ramen bowl.
The photos and video are very helpful. We look forward to years of use and happy to dispose of the chipped/cracked bowls we were using. I feel much safer overall with these bowls (lead free).
"Exactly what I was looking for! They are the perfect color, size, and weight.  Perfect for salads, soup or cereal. Best of all they go well with my new dining room set. Definitely buying another set!"
"These bowls are nice and deep and wider at the top for easy access. Perfect size for every portion of each meal I choose. If you're like me and are a bowl holder while you eat, you will find that this bowl fits perfectly in your hand, not over wide at the bottom. I'm so happy with these. Now I need to get the matching salad bowl."
"These are exactly what I was hoping for. They are large, sturdy, and easy to clean. The slanted edge makes it easy to hold. Also, this particular type of porcelain--or whatever material they use, holds temperature well, meaning if you put hot soup or microwave it, it won't completely burn your hands. I researched these extensively. Would definitely buy again."
"I bought these bowls specifically to serve homemade ramen, and they are the perfect size for a decent portion of ramen. I also use them for salads. They stack nicely for storage, too."
"I loved these bowls because their bigger than the average 16-20 oz bowl. The shipping estimated over a month but I did the purchase anyways because it was the only style I could find that was similar to my existing dining set. It only took a week to arrive!  We have been using them for about a month now and they are very sturdy, no chips or cracks either."
"I've had these for about a month now and they've become my favorite bowls. They're listed as 32oz capacity, but 4 cups takes it to the brim. I tend to fill to about 2.5 cups.  These have been easy to hand-wash, but have done well on the bottom rack of the dishwasher (I've done this once so far) as well.  Pics 1 and 3 show the bowl with 20oz (2.5c) Pics 2 and 4 show the bowl with 24oz (3c)"
"Our whole family loves these! From our cereal addict to our pho officionado, these bowls are large enough to be useful for just about everything. And they stack well in the cupboard, due to their flat bottoms! They're a little too large to fit in the top rack of our dishwasher without hogging all the space. That is their only drawback. Beautiful, classy, perfect!"
"UPDATE: Jun 6 2021: I just had to come by and update my earlier review of these bowls. They are a perfect size for creating ""bowl"" meals. Last night I had rice, veggies, hummous, and some meat. Enough room to toss it in bowl or pile in as is. If you're worried about portion control, then watch how you fill this bowl. *wink* They wash up nicely by hand or by dishwasher. They are nice to look at and work with so many meals. Repeat: ""Worth the investment!"" ========================================== Earlier review: My husband really likes these bowls. He and I are very impressed with them. No chips, no warps, no cracks, and they DO HAVE THE MFR LOGO on the bottom. After reading other reviews, it was the first thing I looked for when I unwrapped. I think they are worth the investment."
I was in the habit of buying the plastic bowls in different colors that would peel after microwave use. I bought these bc my children love to cook noodles in microwave and they are deep enough to avoid spills! They are really durable and cute!!!
"Great soup bowls with a sturdy base. Solid material, easy to wash and clean, and sold at a fair price."
Love the brand thus far! This is my second Dowan bowl purchase and I really love my other set. Beautiful white dishes that I can throw in the dishwasher!
"I bought these for a family member who always complained that the 12 to 20-ounce sized bowls just didn't hold enough cereal and by the time milk is added, and you try to take your first bite the cereal is falling over the sides of the bowl. The Dowan 32-ounce size is working perfectly! It allows for a large portion of cereal, as well as adding as much milk as needed, without the cereal escaping every time you remove a spoon full. This 32-ounce sized bowl can also be used to serve vegetables at dinner time. Versatile and the perfect size. These bowls will be used often!"
"It’s soup season and these fairly large bowls are great for a hearty helping. They came nicely packaged, no damage. They stack fairly well and have a small enough base to hold comfortably."
Nice larger size bowls. I purchased for to serve larger portions of everything.
I bought these to replace some really old bowls I had and really love them! The porcelain color is on the warmer side of white. They are microwave and dishwasher safe. The tall sides help keep food from spilling and they have a nice weight to them without being overly heavy.  I got some matching plates from the same brand and they work well together.
"Great quality porcelain, very light and elegant ,Nice size both for soup and small portions of salad, great price. I use these bowls for everything.Highly recommended."
"You can use these for hot food or cold food. Even a sandwich will fit in them, if it is standing up sideways. They have a glossy glaze. Any kind of food easily washes off the bowls without staining. They are large, but not too heavy. Easy to hold in your hands. They look pretty and you can stack them. Everything is good about these bowls."
These bowls are perfect for serving ramen. Would order again
"I bought my son(who's in college) two sets of these bowls after he told me he & his roommates needed bowls for cereal, spaghetti, etc.. They're boys so they needed something that's durable and bigger than usual. They arrived all in one piece so the packaging is well done. They look just like the picture and are a nice sized bowl (which is specifically what I was looking for). They stack well so they won't take up a lot of space in my son's tiny college kitchen. As far as microwaving and putting these in the dishwasher goes....we'll just have to wait and see. Overall I think they're great bowls."
"I have been using this bowl for about a month now and am very happy with it. If you like cereal, a banana, some fruit, and milk for breakfast you suffer from the problem I did, most cereal bowls are too small. These 32 oz bowls are perfect, deep, and wide enough not to spill. They have held up well in the dishwasher, no chips or cracks after a month. I recommend these bowls."
"I love the quality of these bowls and the fact that they are so easy to stack in the cupboard. Even though they listed the dimensions on the website, I was surprised at just how large a 7"" bowl is, so they are just a little larger than I'm used to, but that's on me."
"EDIT: They sent us a whole new package of bowls after contacting their customer support. Quick and painless too. These bowls are great too, the perfect size for stuff like ramen or soup, or for holding snacks! Updated to five stars!  Really disappointed about this. The bowls themselves are really nice, easy to clean, nice and big without being too heavy. But one of our bows arrived totally shattered. I'd like to keep the three bowls we got intact, since they're fine, but I really would like a replacement bowl, or at least some of my money back."
I really like these bowls. They are the perfect size and weight. I like the shape. They are big enough to fit a big can or serving of soup without spilling over. They go with everything. They are easy to clean and go in the microwave. Just exactly what I wanted!
"Have had for several months now. Still look brand new. Granted they don’t get heavy wear as we mostly use them for soup or as mixing bowls, but some dishes etch over time in a dishwasher, and these have not so far. Heavy, but not overly so, solid, durable, smooth, flawless. Great size for phô too."
These ceramic bowls feel sturdy and are wonderful for Ramen and Soups. Once cleaned they stack securely. They are thick enough to slowly then gently radiate the heat of the contents. Keep the meal warm a reasonable period of time. All white and sheen are consistent. Good Value!
Just a little heavy.......
"Great bowls and makes serving ramen in them, that much more stylish."
"I needed white bowls for salad, soup & pasta. They are a good size in diameter & depth. Very satisfied. Highly recommend."
"Not to big...not to small. Just right for soups, salads, pasta, ice-cream deserts and such. The bottom and the top are just the right size in relation to height. The weight is good also. Very easy to clean and dish washer safe. Can be used in microwave also. I recommend and would buy again."
"So glad I got these bowls. They are of the perfect size and shape for a good portion of soup, noodles, salad, rice, cereal, pasta, or anything. I use it both for serving and for individual use. Simple, elegant, sturdy, easy to hold, easy to wash. No negatives. In fact, I ended up not ordering other bowls because I realize these cover all my purposes."
These bowls are a classic look with a bit of modern thrown in. They are sturdy and can be used for just about anything you would use a bowl for. They were bigger than I thought they would be. I really like them and would purchase them again.
"I looked at a lot of different options for white porcelain bowls to replace ones that succumbed to 9 months in quarantine with our kids. These bowls from Dowan looked to be the exact size and more modern shape that I was looking for. They will be perfect for cereal, soup, pasta, salad, anything really. Most of what I looked at were too small, but I'm very impressed with these. They look like they will serve us well -- if our kids can keep from being rough with them!"
"Great size, solid hefty Bowls. Perfect size for pasta, rice or any other meal. Larger size really comes in handy. Easy to clean. Perfect for microwaveing. New go to Bowls for anything."
These bowls arrived ahead of schedule and were padded so well they could have been delivered by a drone. This an excellent product - microwave and dish washer safe - their appearance and function indicates to me that they should be retailed at a higher price.  Steve Morris
"Stylish design and great size for noodles soup, I wasn't think I would use that so often because the size but ended up I have been using a lot and just bought another set!"
"These are the perfect bowls for soup and stews. At this time of year, with all the snow and ice we’ve been getting, I am making a lot of hot soup dishes and these are the perfect size. I highly recommend them."
"The bowls arrived very fast in a somewhat unimpressive package. But the product was protected well and there’s no damage at all. The size, color, texture are all as expected. We’ve been using them, which are great for big bowls of noodles, etc. We tested it in microwave oven and it functions great. The water in it was hot and the bowl was cool to touch. Great value."
"After reading countless 5 start reviews on Amazon, I decided to order these and see for myself as I was in need of some larger bowls. I was looking for bowls that are modern, simple and sturdy enough for daily use. Glad to say, these are exactly what I was looking for and more! I’m really impressed with the quality and the affordable price tag, I’ll be ordering more from DOWAN."
"These are attractive, pure white porcelain bowls that hold 4 cups of liquid or food. We use them for ""build a bowl"" meals and they are the perfect size. My husband loves them for his big bowl of fruit and oatmeal. They are so pretty and useful that we ordered a second set and gave our ""standard"" sized bowls to Goodwill. Highly recommended."
"Up until now we've been using the big Chinese restaurant bowls for ramen, hot pot, and similar. These hold just two ounces less, but they stack more efficiently and got better in cupboards. The shape and share are attractive. So far they are very sturdy."
Bought these and threw away all my mismatched chipped bowls. These are pretty sturdy and nice looking. Great size for soup or cereal or salad. Just really great all around.
What a great purchase. While eating out of these bowls gives a feeling of nostalgia. A sense of warm inviting hugs from each bite. Easy to hold and gives you the right amount of portion. The only thing that could make this better is a lid to cover unfinished food Love them
It’s an every day salad or cereal bowl that is larger than the typical bowls that come in sets. I never used to have enough room for the amount of salad I would have liked in my bowl and now I do
"I needed some bowls for fruit, vegetables, cereal, etc. The dishes arrived carefully wrapped. Of course, I do not know anything about the safety of the materials used to make the bowls. On the surface, I am very pleased that I bought them."
"We like everything about these bowls. Perfectly sized. We use these for popcorn, salad, spaghetti, stew. I hand wash and nothing sticks."
"That is right, I still eat cereal as a grown man. It is actually dessert after a regular breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Weird I know, but these are some nice bowls for those of us that don't like plastic or metal bowls."
We really like these - perfect size for soup; easy to clean (and they don't discolor); no chip or cracks after months of use.
"Love these deep sturdy bowls,worth every penny…might buy more soon. Can’t find these anywhere else.thx Amazon"
"My kids like to eat large bowls of cereal. These bowls are a hit. Great size for growing boys. So far no chips, cracks or stains. Even though I encourage them to go easy, we go through dishes. Something about dropping or putting them in the sink to hard. So far so good."
"I bought them on a whim, and then had to go back for more the next week. Now I need even more because my sister and my daughter both wanted them, too. We use them daily for a hundred different things ... soup, cereal, rice bowls, spaghetti, food prep, storage. Sturdy, useful, and they fit perfectly in my dishwasher. Thank you, Dowan!"
My family love these bowls so much. They call these there pretty bowls. They are large enough for anything. We use these bowls every day. The are a nice large size and beautiful white. These are very durable and great quality.
"I've only used them once, but the size is perfect, & while the bowl gets hot in a microwave, the food does too - unlike glass bowls, where the bowls heat up, but not the food. The look really good, too."
"These bowls are fantastic! Great for cereal, ice cream, pasta, sushi bowls, salads, soups, and more! LOVE these bowls! Being a minimalist family, we use them constantly because they are the only bowl set we own! They work great for everything, look great, and make the food look great!"
""
I love these. They are nice big bowls! Exactly what I was looking for and competitive price!’  Thank you!
"I love these bowl's! Their easy to clean. Perfect for salads, cereal anything. Super easy to clean and sturdy. I will be ordering more."
"It was time for us to get different bowls and these are perfect! They are great for soup, salads, cereal, etc. Good quality and deep bowls. Easy to clean."
Exactly what I wanted. I wish the company name didn’t wash off the bottom so fast (after 5 washings) as they will be difficult to know brand to replace if needed.
I had debated about what size to get but found these are perfect for our family pho nights.
A restaurant we frequent serve their salads in a large bowl. I like it so much I went looking for some for us to use at home. The large size allows you to fill bowl up only 2/3 of the way and have room to not spill salad when eating. Love them!
I bought these because they are the like corelle dishes. I am a corelle dish owner for years and it seems that they are now so expensive. These bowls are very nice and go with my current corelle dishes.
finally a descent sized cereal bowl that you can use for salads as well
Purchased mostly for large salads. My plates and small bowls were not cutting it. These bowls are great.
"These are fantastic pure white bowls. I've also purchased the plates which come in a set of six. The bowls come as a set of 4. The price is a bit more than I would have liked to pay, but I do love them.  I wish they had more pieces."
"Great bowls, I was expecting a smaller “just for cereal” size, but luckily they are a bit bigger and perfect for ramen as well! Does well in the dishwasher. I’m a fan."
"These bowls are great. We're using them for almost everything. Great product, highly recommend."
"Yes!!!! They were delivered unbroken. Exactly what was advertised. I’m in love with them. Don’t remember if they are dishwasher safe or not, but I washed them by hand, only 4 so no biggie. Definitely recommend!!☺️👍🏻👍🏻"
Highly recommend this bowl. It has a stylish look to it and it’s a perfect dinner size bowl (we like to use it as a noodle or rice bowl). Easy to clean and durable enough to last a long time!
"I already had cereal bowls and wasn't sure I really needed these, but they are so pretty and love the simplicity of the speckles and color. I am so glad I ordered them, they are lower profile and flatter bottom. And I love the clay accent. So perfect. Very sturdy and arrived Very well packaged."
These bowls are the perfect size! I have used them most to make side salds. The size was just right. I love the whole collection. Eating from these plates and bowls makes every meal feel special and beautifully presented
These bowls are so beautiful. I am not happy with the misspelling of lead free. It says lead ferr. I know it doesn't impact bowl usage but poor QC and I am returning them. I want to order a set for a gift and another for myself. Hopefully I won't have to return them.
All of the products of this line are wonderful. These are the perfect bowl size for breakfast or dinner. The brown base looks so cute on my open shelves displayed with my other mora ceramic pieces. Highly recommend!
Plenty of space for salads and dishes that would otherwise stick out or fall off the plate. Great purchase for people who enjoy eating a lot of veggies. I also love that bowl is not heavy.
Been looking for a large wide bowls just like these! So happy it is exactly what I needed. I will be ordering more.
I bought these for one reason: to stop oatmeal from overflowing its bowl in the microwave. I got tired of being glued to the microwave to watch the oatmeal rise and fall in its bowl and many times over the sides onto the floor of the microwave. With these large enough bowels I set the timer for 5 minutes and walk away until the oatmeal is done. Oatmeal stays put. The bowls clean up nicely in the dishwasher and fit into cabinet.
"Received my Bowls TODAY! OMG! Better than expected. My perfect homemade soup bowl, Asian Dish or individual salad bowl. Washed them and still admiring them. Receiving them today I've yet to use, but I'm ""ONE Happy Camper."" Bowls have multi-purpose usage. Glad I took time in my decision and THANKS to reviewers who assisted me in making the right choice. THANKS for the early delivery."
"These are nice big bowls, for salads or serving, or pho. I have a set of smaller bowls from the same company, we love them so I was comfortable ordering these.  The smooth glaze makes them easy to clean, they survive the dishwasher fine, they are sort of heavy as would be expected with such big bowls.  The white color is nice and the shape is pleasant."
"Was a little smaller than I expected and was worried it wouldn't be able to fit a large bowl of pho. To my surprise however, it was able to hold all of the noodles and soup (filled to the brim). Very nice for the price range! Thanks amazon"
Finally a bowl that you can stir up your salads or pasta meals! This is exactly what I was searching for! They look huge but I was sick of stirring up my pasta and salads only to end up wearing them. PERFECT!
"my hands are getting tired of lifting older bowls..they were great but very heavy. I combed all sites and found these at same size I use here and I am sooo happpppppppy ...much lighter in weight and very easy to clean I wanted simple so they would not compete with my other dishes.,,smartest thing I have done in a long time :-)"
"Just PERFECT! Was looking for meal sized, deep bowls and these fit the bill completely! Substantial feel, well balanced and great price."
It’s the perfect size to be used as a personal salad/dinner bowl. Yet it’s deep enough that they could easily be used as a serving dish for a crowd. I love the option for multiple different uses and will be recommending these bowls to all my friends!
"I bought the larger bowl set in June for summer salads. I've also more recently used them for pasta and noodle soup, like restaurants do when bringing out spaghetti or Udon soup, etc. I've realized I used too small bowls, which made eating more awkward and messy than necessary. These are a perfect size to use as a small mixing or serving bowl, too.  These bowls have a good heft and are thick and sturdy. They're easy to wash. To be clear: I've only hand washed because I haven't had many dishes for the dishwasher and because I only had two of these so had to keep them washed and ready for use. That's about to change. Five months later, I've just ordered another set."
"Yes, there are two bowls in the order. And in person, they were a bit larger than I anticipated, but pleasantly so. Do know this: when I removed these from the carton I was stunned by how beautiful they were. (And really how they were such a quality offering.) I immediately went to their product page to see all of their other products. Everything was stunning. Really the headline says it all: Elegant in design, beautiful in execution, reasonably priced -- the perfect gift. The only thing I might add is that if you buy the set as a gift, be prepared to buy a second set because once you see these, you will want a set for your own use."
"Sometimes you need something larger than a cereal bowl. I use this as a bowl to hold ingredients when making a recipe, as a serving dish, and my favorite, as a large popcorn bowl. It’s pretty sturdy and not what I would call lightweight. Also it just looks simple and elegant. Very pleased with this purchase."
"This is a beautiful bowl. I'm delighted with it. It's not a flimsy bowl. It has weight, feels sturdy and the finish is beautiful. I bought 6 of them because they have so many uses. The size is perfect. I use it for salads or Buddha bowls. Today I used one as a fruit bowl. They can be used as serving bowls also. I'm sure I will find many uses for these bowls."
"I bought these bowls to hold side dishes that I cook in a skillet. The surface is very smooth and should be easy to clean. The description said that they are microwave safe but that isn't printed on the bottom of the bowls, which would have been nice because months or years from now, I may be wondering if the bowl is safe to put in the microwave to reheat leftovers and I might not be sure since it isn't imprinted on it."
"Purchased as dog/cat water dishes. I know -- the company that manufactures these bowls probably didn't intend for this purpose but they are great. I know plastic dishes are MUCH cheaper, but I wanted something durable and easy to clean in the sink...."
"These came quickly and were actually bigger than I thought. They’re large and deep, so you can toss salad inside if needed. I also adore the color. They’re also a bit heavy, so you might want to be careful with them."
This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted big bowls for pho like you would get at a restaurant. These bowls are PERFECT. They’re about the size of a large/xl pho bowl.
"I use these bowls far more often than I expected I would. I actually was looking for a large bowl to microwave a serving of oatmeal in, so it wouldn't overflow, and it works great for that. But I use and love them for a variety of things - to hold a bowl of fruit, to serve food, to mix food. Great quality. Look nice. Love them."
I was looking for a couple of bowls that were deep enough to hold fruit in one and onions (we use a lot of onions) in the other. These were the perfect size! Very nice bowls. They were delivered with no chips and on time. I love the classic look of them and highly recommend them to anyone.
"Great large bowls with a good heft to them. The 9.5"" is a nice, flexible size - you can use it for one person's ramen or pho, or put a salad in it for the whole table. Or put enough ice cream in it to give a person diabeetus. They arrived in perfect condition. No complaints."
"These bowls are huge and lovely! You can use them for a huge bowl of soup, Japanese style ramens and noodles or even for a large serving of casserole. Tou can also display fruits in them. I absolutely love these."
"Great quality, but these are huge. I also ordered the bowl plates from this brand, which are huge as well, but these bowls are too large for what I wanted the for. These are true serving bowls. I have ordered and received the 7 oz version and they are the perfect size I needed. Still debating on whether to keep or return these, they are so nice."
"I bought these to use as water bowls for my dog. She seems to prefer drinking out of mugs so I thought, why not try a porcelain bowl? She loves it and I have seen her drinking much more water since switching over. I also like them and will definitely be using for fruit and salads."
I love the clean look of these porcelain bowls. Nice addition to my existing Dowan set.
"I bought the 9.5” sized bowls specifically to use as salad bowls, but they are literally amazing for any meal! They’re perfect as a pasta bowl, especially if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like eating pasta from a plate (me!)  The bowls were packed neatly, and arrived safely and without any damages.  I’ve only had them less than a week, so I can’t say how they’ll hold up just yet… but I’ll update if there are any issues."
"Love these! Are essential parts of my kitchen. Perfect for family style salads or pasta or other large servings. They are beautiful, easy to clean and look great just sitting out. Definitely recommend."
"So you have Vietnamese take out pho or bun bo hue and you come home and you certainly don't want to eat out of the containers they send you home with, we bought 4 of these hearty sized bowls and they are perfect for the bowls of pho and bun bo hue you are about to devour! A+++++"
"These bowls are the right size for set items, They seem to be sturdy and should last a long time. Fast shipping as well."
It looks and feels great. I was worried about the package- for when it arrived they didn’t use a lot of “stuffing” inside to keep the items in the box from getting damaged. Or it would’ve been nice if they added a “fragile” label somewhere as my delivery personnel tossed our shipment in front of our door when delivering. Cannot wait to try serve food in these bowls.
"I love it! I had an issue with them. However, I feel 100% satisfied!!! They replied quick and solved my problem! I will recommend this item! The quality is amazing! Thank you Dowan team for the great customer service!"
These bowls are awesome. You can make a big salad. Nice bowl of pasta. Quick rinse with a little dish soap and you’re ready to go. They’re also dishwasher safe. I use them so much they never make it into the dishwasher.
If you like nice big deep wide bowls- look no further. These are perfect for so many foods. I will buy more for sure
They are a wonderful size. My family eats soups and noodles often. These bowls allow for generous portions without filling them to the brim. They are microwave and dishwasher safe and we are loving their addition to our kitchenware.
These bowls are big! Just what I was looking for my salads and anything the I need to toss and eat right there or serve. They are nice ceramic too. Love them!
"The bowl has nice depth & width. Color coordinates well with an Ocean Paradise dish set I purchased. Also, the 2 bowls are handy for placing 2 large salads on the serving table . I'm absolutely pleased and would purchase again."
"We were going to entertain family and needed additional serving bowls. I was pleased with the clean, stylish look of these and the size was what I wanted to serve the large crowd."
I love the size of this bowl!
Love these for big salads and serving spaghetti or other pasta dishes.
"I was looking for a good size salad bowl that didnt cost an arm and a leg. This is it, and sturdy, well packaged. I went back for 2 more sets!"
"The bowls arrived in perfect condition; they are a bit smaller than I thought but still very useful. I like pure white dishware, and these are great.  I have tried to capture a screen shot so I can receive my free gift, but cannot. I chose the oven mitts; if the company honors their offer, I would appreciate my free gift."
"Pretty in the cabinets, easy to clean, great for a large salad."
I ordered the 39oz Serving Bowls from Amazon.com. It arrived today in great condition. Both my husband & I love the shape/design of the bowl.
"I love these bowls. They are really beautiful and I use them for everything: serving, mixing, pasta, soup, salads and as a fruit bowl. Super high quality, easy to clean."
"Nice big bowls. Perfect for serving a side dish, or for a big bowl of soup."
These feel really sturdy and no one can believe they're from Amazon. Amazing value for money!
"I love this bowl, it's sturdy and has a good weight to it."
This is a nice large thick bowl that will last you a long time.
Perfect for soup. ramen. Great weight to it. I love it.
Perfect size and aesthetics for a salad bowl—a bagged salad fits easily and can even fit two bagged salads. Very happy with this purchase
"I love the large capacity which is perfect for salads and noodles. They are our go to bowls for everything just about. We use them for salads, rice bowls and pho, ramen."
"and when not in use, these are large and can be hard to store with the dishes etc - but nice looking - so we leave them out on the counter and hold potatoes or fruit in them."
I bought these bowls to prepare my salad in. These bowls are the perfect size. I can use them to prepare and serve food in. I plan on buying more.
"Love the color, love the size, love the sturdiness of these bowls! I make big fun salads now and again and I finally found bowls to accommodate. Also great serving bowls!"
I have been looking for a large bowl for my pho soup and this bowl is perfect; great quality and the size is large enough for pho but not too big or too small.
This bowl adds that extra “wow” when eating my salads. Great presentation! Highly recommend this item.
Really like the heft of the bowls. They are useful for several serving needs. Great classic look.
"Love these. Great size, nice quality and beautiful."
Their large size makes them perfect for soups and salads.
"We often do large salads and fusion asian noodle bowls, stuff that we like to be able to mix up once we have it in the bowl. These are exactly what we have been needing!"
"I love these bowls! We use them for salad, in place of a plate and also as a serving dish. Very pretty, well made and sturdy."
I looked a long time for white ceramic bowls and decided on these. I’m so exciting to have these bowls for the upcoming holiday season. I plan to order more!
"These are the perfect size for a generous serving of pasta, a large salad or a Mexican rice bowl as some examples. The quality is good, easy to clean and they came wrapped very securely."
I love these bowls. I have both the small ones & the large ones. They are elegant & look great on table. Very happy with my purchase & with the service.
Perfect set to complete my new home. Everything is the right size. I searched high and low for an entire white set that had the sizes and pieces I needed.
Bowls arrived very fast they are perfect I can’t wait to make a chopped salad!!!!
These bowls are beautiful! We purchased the teal colored bowls not the white. My only “complaint” is that they are heavy and we are using them as dining bowls. Of course that heavyweight construction means that they will hold up over time. I am very pleased with my purchase.
"Good quality. Perfect size for veggies for serving to people, or something like a salad for each person."
"These will be great for serving large salads, pasta, etc. Classic bowl."
"I make lots of gumbows,stews,pasta dishes.There a great size for the hungry people I feed. Love these bowls.Easy to clean and really attractive bowls"
"super pleased with these bowls from very hot soup to very cold desserts it accomodates it all. No leaking, no saturation and no excessive coating. Natural and functional. Will repeat the order when they are all gone. On days when there is just no room in the dishwasher they are perfect so one does not have to waste water hand washing. They were great too, when a family member had covid and we kept them on toss away plates and bowls."
"During the ramadan, i served the soups in these cute cups. Good for quick eatable things even though liquid and hot. After 10-15 minutes if you keep the hot soup in it, dont trust the durability."
Sturdy and worth the money.
We use these bowls for a lot of our outdoor events and they have never let us down. Very study and leak proof.
As food bowl for puppy
But they will compost well.
BOWL LEAKS-UNUSABLE-WASTE OF MONEY
"I received this set of 150 12-ounce compostable bowls in great condition. They come wrapped in plastic. I did not realize how small 12 ounces is, and that's my fault, but just a heads up that for adults it is a very small size. I would say they are probably good for snacking or being mindful of your portions. I think they are a perfect size for small children. I mostly use them for dry snacks like chips, but I decided that my real test would be with liquids. I used one of these bowls for hot tomato soup, and it did really well. The shedding on it was minimal at most, and that was only towards the end when my spoon would scrape against the sides. I am impressed with these bowls' durability and performance, considering that they are compostable and eco-friendly. Price is a little steep, but like other eco-friendly dinnerware, that is to be expected."
"The older that I get, the more that I find myself looking for alternatives to plastics. These bowls work in an excellent fashion and I am amazed at how well these hold water. These have an innate ability to resist falling apart like some others that I’ve tried. I’ve got no earthly idea as to how they do it but I can say these don’t get all soggy in a few hours…or even a few days usually. I say this because I have left a few of them outside as a dish for my baby chickens as a water bowl and they haven’t leaked. Yes, the bottom gets a bit gross because they’re outside and chickens aren’t the cleanest but I’m seriously impressed. These are an outstanding alternative.  Pros:  Made very well Super strong Holds water for days Outstanding alternative to plastics Good value  Cons:  None so far"
"100% Compostable Paper Bowls [12 oz.] – 150 Disposable Bowls Eco Friendly Sturdy Tree Free Liquid and Heat Resistant Alternative to Plastic or Paper Bowls by Ecovita  I love the fact that these are paper bowls instead of plastic. They hold up reasonably well and work with hot or cold food items. A nice quantity per pack, too, so a good amount to stock up on some disposables that I can feel good about."
Commercially compostable these 12 ounce bowls are made from paper not plastic. They were a bit lighter than expected and my concern was whether the bowl could tolerate a hot bowl of soup or would it collapse or leak so I filled one with boiling water. After waiting 10 minutes I checked and there were no leaks and although the exterior or the bowl was warm it was not hot to the touch. Good disposable bowls.
"First of all ... these bowls are smaller than I thought they'd be. They are good for children's portions of cereal or mac and cheese ... or would be fantastic appetizer-sized bowls for a holiday party. The photo of the 2 meatballs I added is a good representation of the bowls' capacity. Those are two regular-sized (medium) meatballs and that's about what fits into one bowl.  If you are hosting a party with hot h'orderves and would like to set them out on a table, these are a decent size and the best part about them is that they are ecologically responsible as they will biodegrade. They are made from Bamboo and Sugarcane and are, of course, made in China. While they aren't as aesthetically pleasing as the white paper bowls, given that these have a rougher cardboard appearance ... what they lack in presentation, they make up for in environmental responsibility.  I tested them on a few items and here is what I found ... - Meatballs, these held up well and they were rigid enough to cut through the meatball without bending or puncturing the bottom. They held their shape nicely and the edges didn't crush while being held. They did tend to have tomato sauce and oil soak into the inner bowl but after 10 minutes, this did not go through/appear on the outside of the bowl.  - Cereal and milk ... The bowl held a small portion of cereal and milk and did not crunch in when handled. The milk was in the bowl fpr about 10 minutes and did not soak through the bowl.  - Piece of pie ... The pie's wedge shape did not fit into the bowl but I was able to smoosh the tip in a bit. With harder crust pies and cakes, you'd have an issue with fit. The bowl held up well to cutting the pie into bite-sized pieces and did not puncture.  I did not have ice cream to try with this but given my experience, I would think they would be ideal for a one scoop ice cream sundae or a kid's birthday with single scoops. The bowls appear to hold liquids well enough for shorter periods (I did not test longer than 20-30 minutes.)  Overall, while I wish the bowls were larger and adult meal-sized, these will be good for snacking, handing out samples, or kids' meals/snacks. They handle hot foods well and don't seem to leak or leach through within 10 minutes or so. I will look to see if they have adult-sized plates and bowls for meals. Sometimes, we want a quick dinner in front of the tv and not have to worry about washing dishes later. Using responsible biodegradable servingwear like this makes me feel better about using plastic bowls or paper bowls coated with a plastic, which breaks down slowly.  The size of these don't do much for me ... but for those with kids, restaurant owners, Superbowl party snacks and appetizer buffets or tailgating, they'd be great!"
"We always seem to run out of bowls, so it is nice to have these available when needed. They are sturdy and hold up well to dry or liquid ingredients. They are fine for single use, but we have used them multiple times for dry snacks.  The bowls do not bend and spill the contents. They do not disintegrate when filled with liquid, even over a few hours.  A great supply to have on hand."
"The size of these bowls is great for snacks for our kids or just condiments. It can basically fit a doughnut in it to give you an idea of the actual size.  The look of these are great, the eco-friendly aspect of them is awesome too.  There were no flavors or smells I noticed added from these bowls so that's awesome as well.  Overall, I love these, would recommend."
"really good value pack for small bowls. they are the perfect size for portioned meals and snacks. on the downside, while they are sturdy and feel great, they tend to look really ugly as soon as any amount of grease touches them. be careful and don't be alarmed by how the bowl starts to look as soon as you put some potato chips in there. it'll look scary but it still functions fine"
"These are very well made ""paper"" bowls. Thy hold up well to everything I have thrown at them, including hot soup. I was not aware how small these are. I believe that they may hold about one cup of liquid. I'm not sure what you use that for other than maybe some nuts or fruit salad or some side dish. Overall good but be aware of the size before you buy."
"Strong and sturdy. I use them for holding and carrying food. However, they're flammable so I can't keep them by the stove as I often do with paper bowls. And they're stronger than paper bowls. Disposable and compostable. Better than plastic."
"These are a good value for the amount of bowls you get. They are great for small items, like ice cream. I like that they are compostable. The only thing is that I wish they were a little bigger."
"I like these bowls a lot. They have a rustic feel, are pretty sturdy. You can use them for food, or really anything, like for household projects."
Love these bowls! Sturdy and convenient
"These balls are small in size, and are great for things such as ice cream and sides. The problem is that they aren’t to durable against liquid. As you can see in my photo, the liquid begins to make its way through the bowl. This can be an issue if you don’t want to make a mess."
These are very small and flimsy. I don't know what I could actually use them for.
Way smaller than what I thought but I’m keeping them bc it helps me to eat less. Very durable even after microwaving  Doesn’t leak after microwaving soup  I would recommend for kid size and is a good way to eat less
Everything. We use them when traveling.
These bowls are great. I lived my entire life until now without owning shallow bowls. I’ve been eating spaghetti off of a plate like some kind of wild animal. My life is forever changed.
"As far as function goes, these bowls are undeniably great. They’re perfect for “bowls” (grain/protein/veggie bowls), soups, salads, pasta... very versatile. They arrived intact and on-time. My disappointment is with the color. The website makes these bowls appear a very crisp, cool, bright white, but they are really much closer to cream than stark white. My kitchen utilizes open-space shelving for dishes and these do not coordinate with the rest of my dinnerware. These bowls are currently sitting on a low shelf, and will probably be relocated to a cabinet once I rearrange my kitchen. In the picture I posted, the color difference is subtle, but if this is the type of thing that matters to you (as it does to me), please take note. I will never be able to serve food with multiple plates for one course if company is over. I think that’ll be ok for now, but it is kind of a pain and I wish the color swatches came through more clearly on the Amazon product page."
"I ordered these because Williams-Sonoma ($24/4 bowls version) was out of stock. We have absolutely loved them. Unbeknownst to me, W-S didn't cancel my order as I requested, so after months, that order showed up. Curious, I compared the two and these are far superior - a true white (not greyish like W-S), larger, and the perfect side slope for eating. They mix perfectly with my Wedgwood White bone china. Also, they are very sturdy without looking chunky. Given my clumsiness, in fairness they should have some damage, but we are months in and not even a chip. Buy these, you won't regret it. Have used for ""___ bowl"" dishes, mealk like eggplant parm that are messy, soups, and more."
"The plates seem thick and sturdy. They are really handy and are great for many kinds of dishes. One of the photos show my Shrimp Jambalaya with Cauliflower Rice. Another photo shows a plate on a 14 1/2 inch diameter place mat.  Love them, buying another set."
I am coming back and buying a second set. I love these. They work perfectly and fit into the dishwasher like a plate vs the bowls I was using. These bowl/plates make for a nicer presentation for dishes. I literally buy 100’s of products off of Amazon a year (if not more) and this purchase ranks in top 5% of me being completely satisfied.
"I have a LOT of plates and bowls. I might even have a bit of an addiction. These are easily going to rise to my favorites. They’re elegant, beautiful, easy to clean and showcase your food perfectly. I use them as individual bowls for pasta and yogurt bowls as well as for small serving bowls for fruits and veggies. Pretty awesome all around bowls."
"These bowls are awesome. When I first opened them, I thought they were too small … WRONG, they are just right!!! Perfect for those meals that you need a plate, but with some sidewalls to hold the sauce or juice or whatever. Great for spaghetti or chix breast with rice and lots of sauce. Excellent for a side salad or an entrée salad because it's all spread out perfectly (vs a deeper bowl where your dressing ends up on the bottom before you are finished). I highly recommend! I do with there were color options but white works with our existing dishes so I will live! :)"
"We LOVE these dishes! We often eat large salads and smaller meals and these bowls are perfect for both. I got them to go with some Amazon dishes as the salad plates in the set were a bit small for most uses. These look great, they're the perfect size, and add a touch of simple elegance to a meal. They could be used as serving dishes for sides as well. What's not to like?"
"I know these bowls are supposed to be soup bowls, but I love using them for everything else BUT soup! They are perfect for salads, pastas and as you can tell from my photo. ..pork buns! They are pretty large so anything can be put in them. I love that and also that it is microwaveable. They are stackable and have a clean, white look to them. The only thing is, you have to be careful. ..they are ceramic and might break easily. Other than that, I love these bowls!"
These are the best of both worlds. Can be used as bowl or plate. Or both. Keeps food on your plate with enough room for different items. Love the quality and colors!!!
"These are very nice pasta bowls! We also use them a lot for things like curry where there is a lot of sauce. We use them more than plates, honestly."
"They are attractive and great for dishes that won't sit well on a plate - shallow, so not so good for soups. I absolutely love them."
Love these! I bought them not expecting a whole lot of use from them but they became my favorite for pasta and more
"I received my first set of four shallow salad bowls as a wedding gift in 1991. I have one bowl left. About 20 years ago I was handed down a set and although they aren't as perfectly shaped as the first set, we use them for everything from pasta to soup. When my 14 yr old broke a dish while unloading the dishwasher I started to panic that this set was headed for extinction too! I began looking at all kinds of dishware and spent a good three weeks trying to choose a set of shallow bowls. There are lots of good color and pattern options, but ultimately I decided to with the plain white because I wasn't replacing all my dishes. These were reasonably priced, shipped and arrived on time, and after using them for the first time for nothing more than chicken teriyaki and rice, I know they are the bowls I didn't realize I'd been missing for decades! This surface area for food before the sides start to slope upward is a full 7 inches and the whole bowl is 8.5 across. The side-slope is a gentle transition, allowing for a little extra food area. The sides are 2 inches deep, which is 1/2 deeper than our current shallow bowls, so I have no doubt these will be great for all soups and stews. To sum it all up, we LOVE these bowls! They will likely be the most used dish in the house."
"The shipping came on time and the package came well padded. No bowls were broken. Actually, I'm not sure if this is a bowl or a plate.  We were at our local California Pizza Kitchen and noticed the kids pasta plate. It looked exactly like this. I've been wanted a plate with a higher edge for a while. When my husband commented on the plate, I asked him if he wanted it. When he said sure, I quickly search Amazon while at dinner. The brand at CPK was different and more expensive. I saw this bowl and read the reviews. I hesitate for maybe a couple of hours before I hit the 'buy' button.  It has been in my house for a week now. We don't cook much, but the bowl looks beautiful in our cabinet. It is not as white as our square Corelle set (see pictures). The color does match our White Elements set. We got the White Elements for our wedding gift from Macy's.  The size is the medium size, but that is a good portion. Plus it doesn't take that much space in my kitchen cabinet. I'm glad I didn't buy the bigger one since we rarely use our big Corelle plates.  After looking at the logo of this brand, I realized I've seen it before. I normally see this brand in airbnb cabins that we have rented.  So far no complaints. It does what it needs to do. And now when I make pasta, I don't have to ask my husband if he wants to eat it out of a bowl or plate."
"This porcelain bowl set is amazing. It comes with 6 bowls that can put many things on like rice, pasta, noodles, soup, and salad. It fits a big portion of food and and has a high durability. The color of bowl is also great and fit along with other kitchen sets easily. I use this bowl set everyday and really love them. I am thinking about buying another set of these bowls."
"I received them as a gift and I've used them almost daily. Great for pasta, salads, soups - anything. Good price too."
"Exactly as specified. This size can be used for many different uses...salads, pasta, soup or to serve vegetables on a dinner table. Value pricing too."
"Recently changed out all the dishes in the cabinet and really love these for cereal, salad, pasta and ice cream. Well made and a great price"
"I have enjoyed serving food on these dishes tremendously. They are so classy and hold SO much food as you can see from the pictures. They work for everything I put in them, including steak for my husband. My salads have never been more glorious because the toppings can spread across a larger area. And my kids even use them for cereal as an excuse to have a giant amount lol. My teenager and I reach for these every single time we cook. It just makes your meal seem so much more appetizing. Get them. They are so worth the price."
These pasta bowls are very well-made and can be used for serving salad as well. I am sure that I will find other uses for these perfectly sized bowls.
"These bowls are just a great size and shape. Great for pasta of course but also salads, cereals, deserts and serving bowls. They were packed well with no chips or marks. And because they are white they will be easy to add to any table wear. I bought twelve and use them often. Great for family gatherings."
"I love these bowls! They came very well packaged, so there was no chance of even one of them breaking. They are pretty heavy in my opinion, so super sturdy/durable, and I see them standing the test of time.  I really like the wide plate-like shape with the lip all the way around. They’re perfect for pasta and salad. It’s easy to evenly spread pasta sauce over the top or salad toppings/dressing. It’s like using a plate that won’t spill anything over the edge. Perfect bowls for everyday use or even special gatherings."
"I received my pasta bowls today and felt compelled to write a review right away; for the price, they exceed my expectations in every way. First, they were packaged incredibly well. They were wrapped entirely in styrofoam with styrofoam inserts between each bowl. Second, the glazing is thick and covers each bowl evenly. Third, after unpacking, I put them in the dishwasher and ran them through a normal wash cycle. They washed up beautifully. No chips, scratches, or discoloration. I will use these bowls every day for pasta, salad, and messy entrees and will update this review to describe how well they hold up."
"I described as heavy (in a good way) and rich looking. I have used them for a big salad, which is perfect. I will use them soon for soup. I would recommend these as a gift"
"I would highly recommend these pasta bowls/plates. They are VERY sturdy and quality made. The size ( 30 oz ) is perfect for my family, and I serve EVERYTHING in these plate bowls such as Salads, pasta, breakfast meals, etc.  I was impressed with the packaging, and the delivery as they arrived ( Amazon Prime!! )the next day after ordering .  The bowls/plates arrived perfectly as they were packaged tightly with several thick pieces of a foam type material between each bowl, to cushion the bowl/plates... and on the sides as well.  An excellent price for a very quality product. I would highly recommend this product and will buy again."
"These are exactly what I was looking for! I needed larger bowls for a big salad, or pasta. The white porcelain just about matches my Crate and Barrel dinnerware, and seems well made. Unlike many fragile things sold on Amazon, they actually came very well packed and protected— no damage whatsoever."
"My husband really loves to cook and on occasion, he'd even go so far as to try to ""present"" our meals in a cool and beautiful fashion. I saw these bowls at my mother-in-law's house and thought they were beautiful, so I ordered them for him for Christmas. HE LOVES THEM! I do, too! They truly make even the simplest of meals seem styled, eye-catching and so much more aesthetically pleasing! It makes the cooking process (and the eating process) more fun! They are durable, easy to clean and look great sitting on our open shelving. You won't be disappointed."
"Seriously one of the best ""random"" (WTH, I'll give 'em a try?!) purchases I've ever made!! We use them for MANY different things, but I'd have to say they've proven MOST handy (so far) for a serving of casserole, dinner side salads, crusty bread with dipping sauce, and pie with ice cream on the side.  The bit of curve to their shape keeps them from being too stark for older place-settings, but the crisp white makes them suitable for modern dishware, too. So far they've been very sturdy, and we would DEFINITELY order them again! (In fact, we're thinking of ordering MORE!!)"
"Would it be excessive to buy 6 more for a family of three? LOL. These are not just for spaghetti! We use them for soups, And sometimes for a regular dinner plate to help certain foods stay contained. They look very elegant and the dishwasher makes easy clean up. Again....I love these bowls...."
"We love these! We always had “plate bowls” growing up and use it for pasta, chili, Mexican, Chinese, burgers and fries, etc. and they were great for portion sizing and having that rim around the edge so food doesn’t spill over. Had to get a set of my own so I found these. They don’t over heat in the microwave, they don’t stain, and they wash well in the dishwasher. My first order one came broken so amazon let me get a new set. Glad I did"
"I hoped to find a multi-purpose bowl that could be used for pasta, small serving dish, basic shape with no frills so it would go with other dishes. This bowl is the perfect size and depth. I hoped it would be a good pasta dish, but is SO much more than that. In just a few short days we've used these for pasta, cereal, soup, serving bowl for side dish......these are GREAT. Highly recommend."
I'm impressed with the style and quality of these bowls. Purchased them for serving pasta. They are both stylish and durable. They came packed with a sturdy foam separating and encasing the dishes. They appear versatile enough to use for salad and soup.
"Arrived on time and as described.  -These are beautiful heavy plate/bowls! The colour is deep and rich and solid. -They stack well in a cupboard on on the buffet for serving. -The -shallow- bowl is wide and deep enough for a serving of spaghetti, salad, or soup, etc. -Sturdy, not fragile like Gramma's china.  Bottom line: Definitely recommend for daily dining. Nice enough for gifting. Great value. Would buy again."
"I was looking for a simple pasta bowl but I hit the jackpot when I ordered these! Arrived timely (thank you amazon prime), packed well in a sturdy box with styrofoam sheets to separate the plates ensuring their safe arrival. They are a beautiful shiny white, feel sturdy however not heavy (which is important for those of us with arthritis) and so far they have washed and worn well. Dishwasher of course. I love them so much I have used them for other meals aside from pasta such as a steak with potato, cereal and yogurt with added granola and nuts. I am so happy with this purchase. Guess what the family (adult children) are getting for christmas?"
"These are such a pretty cobalt blue. I adore them. Sort of a shiny navy. They have worked for spaghetti, dessert - anything you would need a slightly higher lipped plate for. They aren't good as cereal bowls but something like spaghetti - it fits the bill. I have also dropped one and it didn't break. Probably a fluke as these are for sure breakable but we are really enjoying them."
"The portion of these bowls are perfect! I find them versatile for many dishes I cook at home between pasta, curries, and salads. They stack up nicely in my cabinets and wash up easily by hand. I don't use a dishwasher so I can't tell you how good they hold up against extreme heat. I was a little disappointed that they were not a true white and a bit on the creamier side in terms of color. Overall, I was satisfied with this these and how they were packed for shipping. I highly recommend."
"We love these shallow bowls. We have been using them constantly for 3 months, including microwave and dishwasher. They make a very attractive presentation for your food. You can use for a small or large salad. We intended it for pasta and that’s perfect. Yesterday I served short ribs with sauce, mashed potatoes and glazed carrots and it held everything well and I was able to use a steak knife to cut the meat up so they do work well as a plate. Everything looks so pretty in them, the size is perfect, highly recommend."
These bowls are exactly what I was looking for. They are perfect for holding your pasta or salads and you don't have to worry about things falling off the side or leaking. The bowls seem a little thin and fragile but they did great in the dishwasher. They are not perfect either. They have swirling in the porcelain. I don't mind it because they match my other ceramic dishes. Overall great bowls!
"These wide, low bowls are perfect for salad, pasta, or even in place of a more traditional plate. They are basic white, slightly bigger than personal size, and easy to clean. They arrived in a box with bubble wrap between each bowl and from top to bottom and side to side. This would be a great wedding gift for the couple starting out, or as a gift to a college student in their dorm or someone else just getting a start in their first place."
"I looked at multiple stores and ordered multiple different brands of similar bowls before settling on these. We find them a great, versatile size. They work as pasta bowls, and also for meals that have a sauce component, and also work well as a serving bowl for side dishes. Many bowls I looked at of this shape were more like pottery, too thick. The thickness of these bowls is just right, elegant looking for a formal place setting, but they have been durable and wash up great in a dishwasher. Love them!"
These are the most practical and frequently used purchase I think I’ve made. They’ve almost replaced the dinner plate. We’ve changed our eating style over the last several years to more salad or rice based dishes where proteins and vegetables all go in the same bowl. Also used for stews and polenta and pancake and pasta based meals. They work great for reheating in the microwave. Highly recommend.
"First I'd like to say that I'm very impressed with the packing/shipping. These bowls were the most securely packed item that I've ever received. Secondly, I was a little hesitant to order these bowls, because I've been disappointed before. Either too small or cheaply made. But these are the perfect size, weight and the color is beautiful. Don't wait, order them, you won't be sorry."
Really liked these. They are not the cheapy thin ceramic plates. They are good quality and the size is perfect for anything. What I love most is that I can use it both as a plate (pasta/salad) or a bowl (cereal/soup) so there is no need to have and abundance of plates and bowls that take up more room. Zero complaints. I would definitely buy again
"These bowls are just the right size for any meal. They are great for meals where the food may run off the sides of a plate, i.e. Spaghetti, salads with dressing, or meals where you have many different portions. I liked them so much I ordered another set. They are sturdy and you can put them right into the dish washer when done."
"Great quality, everything arrived in great shape. Perfect for dinner salads + I use them for food I don’t want to spill off the edge of a plate, like saucy pasta or rice dishes. Not sure I would use for soup, they’re more plates than bowls. But these are exactly what I was looking for."
"I love these bowls! They arrived quickly in a well padded box. The color is wonderful. They clean up easily. They have a good weight to them; not so heavy that you can’t easily carry it full of pasta, but not so light that you’re afraid to grip it too tightly! When I first got them I thought they were smaller than advertised. They are exactly 30 oz. , but 30 ounces is not as big as you think it is! Turns out to be just the right size for us. Are there any other matching pieces?"
"What doesn’t look good in these bowls? These Y YHY Pasta Bowls 30oz, Large Salad Serving Bowls, White Soup Bowls, Porcelain Pasta Plates and Bowls Sets, are Microwave and Dishwasher Safe, and come in a Set of 6. They are awesome. My whole family enjoys using them. Eating should be an experience, lose the paper plates (we did)... it’s time to upgrade both for yourself and for the environment. 😊"
"Seriously my new favorite bowls! Awesome for pasta, salads, any kind of rice dishes topped with stir fry or curry. These are so versatile.  Some reviews had me cautious, but I was pleasantly surprised with the color being spot on white. The thickness and diameter of these bowls are just perfect! LOVE them! I bought a second set straight away, and we use them daily."
I really like these bowls even though they are not quite what I was originally looking for. You get a nice bit of real estate with a generous lip to contain any sauce you may have. They are heavy weight and sturdy. It's too soon to tell how the finish will withstand the dishwasher but they look great now.
"I've had these bowls for several months now and I find that I use them all the time. Eating arrangements in our house are, shall we say, ad-hoc. One of us lives in a wheelchair and the other does the cooking. We eat wherever it is convenient. These shallow bowls are great for every meal and they have prevented several spills already,"
I am very happy with this product and would recommend them. I think my favorite part about them is the size and shape. They are exactly what I was looking for. Both my husband and son commented on how much they like the size and shape of these bowls too. These bowls have become the household favorite and are the most used dish of the house!
"These are perfect for pasta! We actually use them all the time. They also make great salad bowls. At first I thought they might be a little small for what I wanted, but as it turns out they are the perfect size for the perfect portion. Love that they are white and make a beautiful table setting. Highly recommend."
These are exactly what I have searched for and very well made. These are ceramic which will hold the chill for salads or the heat for pasta. They came individually wrapped as well as a full wrap around all of the bowls. I was impressed when I opened the box.
"I love these classy, sturdy, beautiful And multifunction dishes/bowls! I love White dishes because they show off true colors of the food. These are the perfect weight, perfect depth and perfect design. Excellent quality. I am ordering more. They don’t get hot when microwaved."
They are so cute. Shiny. I love the combination with white. I'm going to use them for soup. My family is soup people. That's why I bought them for. They all came in very good condition. Each plate was wrapped in Styrofoam. If that's what they call it. Would recommend.
"I Absolutely love these dishes. They make all meals appealing. I love that I found a plate /bowl. My salads stay in the bowl when cutting, pasta has air so it cools off quickly since its spread out. I love the perfect white color. And they clean so easily and not bulky or heavy for the cabinets"
"Great bowls, I bought the white ones. Super big for my portion sizes and love that. Super sturdy, they came well packaged. The plates had a couple of scratches here or there, but nothing too big for me to contact the company. They do offer you customer service if you were to receive chipped, scratched or broken glasses or if you were just not happy with your purchase. So that right there warrants a great review.  Highly recommended"
"We have a salad with dinner nearly every night as part of our efforts to get fresh greens into our diet and these bowls make a perfect vessel to eat them from. The simple white bowl lets the greens shine. The shape is also perfect for pasta meals and we've loved using them for chicken in sauces over rice. Best of all, they are microwave and dishwasher safe."
I researched for a while before deciding to get rid of my conventional plates. I decided on these and I'm happy with that choice. They're not too big or too small. They fit nicely in our smaller microwave and they're quite sturdy. Highly recommend!
"We have had these for a while, they are the go to dishes for my kids."
We use these beautiful bowls mainly for salads although you can use them for many things. The bowls are beautiful and very strong. They are a little pricey but well worth the extra money. I highly recommend these salad bowls. Give them a try I can assure you'[[ love them.
"My old set of a serving bowl and 4 individual bowls got down to 2 serving bowls and I was sad. I looked at a lot of bowls and even found the same set on ebay, but I chose these. We make homemade spaghetti about once a month and need/use good size pasta bowls. These are great and we are very happy with the size, shape and quality."
Lemon butter salmon over wild rice with sea scallops.  The plates are good quality and heavy. They came in perfect without a chip and have stood up to several dinner parties and a clumsy roommate since. Would buy again if needed.
"Beautiful and incredibly versatile. I've used them every day and every day I tell my husband how much I love them! Perfect size and depth for pasta, salads, soups, stews. They look so sleek too and will complement just about any style of kitchen decor. <3"
"I got a set of pasta bowls as a wedding gift that I loved but sadly they broke and are discontinued by pottery barn. So my hunt began. As a minimalist, I don’t want a million dishes and I certainly don’t want to return things that can break. I was worried that these were a tad too small but after a month of use I am very happy with the size. I don’t really use my plates as much anymore, as these bowls are very versatile. Hope this helps!"
"I ordered used bowls from the Amazon Warehouse. The package had been opened but everything was well pack. It may have been that someone had order the wrong size for them. I am please with these bowls, no chips or marks of any kind, just very nice pasta bowls. This saved me a few dollars. I recommend these bowls."
"These arrived with excellent packaging to protect each individual bowl, they are made very well and rival my collection of Fiesta Bowl/Plates that are a tad too large. Most of all, they are classic and will do justice to the many cooking adventures that I am taking on these days."
"I was looking for dinner plates with high sides and found these. They came in nearly perfect condition. (One plate had the tiniest chip on the backside of it). Other than that they have been great! They seem sturdy enough but I'm still pretty careful when handling them. I feel like the bottom could easily chip. I've had them for about a month now, washed them in the dishwasher several times and they've held up great. I would definitely recommend, and plan on buying more soon!"
These are the greatest addition to our dinnerware set - calling them Pasta Bowl is way too limiting. A great alternative to a dinner plate when you are eating anything with a sauce involved and perfect for entree-sized salads (like a grilled chicken caesar salad.) Nice and deep but they still fit well within the racks of my dishwasher. Great color - matched my white dishes perfectly. Smooth texture inside and out. The bottom is finished nicely so they don't scratch counters or table surface. Definitely recommend.  0
"We LOVE these bowls! I have been searching for great bowls for cereal/soup/chili/salad for ages and having zero luck. Honestly, I was starting to sympathize with Goldilocks - every bowl I bought was either too small or too big, too fragile or too heavy... until these!  Make no mistake, these are large, sturdy bowls - you can put a full portion of food in them and have plenty of room left - and that's what my family needs. I wanted room enough in the bowl so that if one of my sons, who are basically grown men but still have to coordination of toddlers, are walking with a bowl they're not slopping it over the edges - or going back to the pot for 57 servings. And they're sturdy - so I don't have to worry about them breaking when they get put, a little too forcefully, in the sink or when they clank together in the dishwasher (because really, when is the last time you met a kid that stacks the dishwasher correctly?). L O V E !  tl;dr: If you need large, sturdy bowls, get these!"
"I don't normally write reviews. However, this company deserves a great review. They are like the perfect general use bowl. They fit a box of mac n cheese with just enough extra lip at the top. Also tried fitting those bertolli frozen pasta meals for 2 - fits the whole portion. So i think most of those frozen dinner or quick box meals are all going to fit this bowl. They are the goldie locks weight - not light not heavy, just right. And with the tall sides it really gives them a sturdy base on the table. They wash really well in the dishwasher too. I've put them in with dry caked on tomato sauce and cheese sauce and they come out perfectly clean. They also stack up fairly condensed for shelf storage. Just make sure they are dry because i stacked them a little wet and found them stuck together a little bit later on from the water.  The packaging they come in is really nice.. Its like these stretchy fish net foam bowls that hugs each bowl perfectly. Its actually pretty fancy. You could almost tie some string to them and hang them to hold fruit or something.  The price at about 10 bucks a piece, I mean c'mon its more than other bowls but honestly i'll blow $25 on uber eats sometimes when im hungover. And these have totally saved me from doing that when i can cook up a big bowl of something for a couple bucks and just pass back out with some nice ASMR video.  Lastly, the customer service team is responsive and easy to work with. One bowl out of the 2 sets i bought had a tiny spot that didn't get glazed.. So I had a discolored spot from some marinara that stained the dry clay under the glaze. And I just sent a photo to them and asked if they would send me a replacement and they got back to me the next day and sent me a new one. Free of charge. And I didn't have to go through the whole process of packing up the whole set, returning them, and waiting for a new batch.  These bowls rock, I'm very happy with them, their support team is great. Stop wasting your money on uber eats and cook something at home folks!"
"We don’t talk about it, but you know the feeling of eating out of the perfect bowl. The satisfaction of being able to palm the base, yet have the depth for a generous bowl of cereal, or two(ish) delicious scoops of ice cream. You already know what crappy bowls are like. They’re shallow and just scream sad studio apartment. No more. These are the bowls you imagined having all your life. Simple, yet elegant. Can it be a cereal bowl at midnight after another bowl? *cough* Yes, it can, and it’s going to be exquisite. Can it be also be filled with an entire bag of Hershey Kisses at Christmas this year because these bowls also look like serving bowls that you can use for the holiday party you’re hosting now that the pandemic will finally be over for the love of God?! You betcha.  Let’s see what else...easy to clean. Only slightly on the heavy side (but who isn’t, am I right?). Seems sturdy. Purposely stackable. It was packaged very well too and it survived shipping (whew!). Super happy with this. I think I’ll go have some cereal now..."
I love this bowl!!! Arrived in a nice packaging. Perfect bowl for cereals or anything. I love how it is excellently made! Very different from the thin cheap looking ones you buy from walmart. I love using it for my ramen. It is tall enough that I could sit and watch tv while holding it without being worried of spilling hot soup on me.
"Sturdy, thick walled bowls. Their color is not like the typical porcelain bright white color (with a blue-grey undertone); rather, bowls are more cream colored or off white - almost like the color of bone china. These bowls probably won't exactly match your other porcelain pieces, if you are fussy about things like that."
"Way better than I expected! The Keurig in the back to show the size, its definitely bright white, and big, perfect for anything! I was reluctant at first because its round, and white but I'm done with square stuff. FDA approved, good for micro, oven, dish washer and freezer... cant beat that! We like hearty meals so these are a perfect size for that.. was sick of using the 5 cup rubbermaid containers to eat big meals without getting back up for seconds. Can have salad and dinner in the same bowl! Going to be buying more from dowan!"
"The perfect bowl for my oat bran, which I microwave daily in my office kitchen. Also, the perfect size for soups and salads. High quality, which is a must for me!"
"Beautifully shaped, deep bowls. Exactly what I was looking for. I'm so tired of bowls too shallow for soup or cereal, and these are nice and deep."
"Just got them but they look awesome! Nice and deep for cereal, salad, soup, ice cream, whatever! We just didn’t like the more traditional shallow bowls that you usually find, these should be perfect! We have honestly not used them yet, but if there are issues I will update this review."
"I got these so I could prepare and eat my oatmeal in a single bowl. I tried it with my smaller (normal size) cereal bowls and made a mess in our microwave. These are large enough for me to put in the milk, oats and some fruit, bring it up to temperature and let it sit before consuming it. One bowl, no ness, quick cleanup because it goes right into the dishwasher. My only issue is getting them clean in the dishwasher. They are so deep that if placed on the top rack at an angle some oatmeal remains stuck on one side. Placed upside down on the bottom rack, they get clean! Learning curve! I like them."
"I usually will buy mix and match bowls at yard sales or flea markets...if they break, oh well.  Well, I love, love, love these bowls! They are beautiful, well-balanced, sturdy, solid bowls...might I add, elegant. I ordered them for placing communion kits on the altar at church, and kept two for myself. They are deep, so I expect my oatmeal will not overflow. Great size for serving veggies or popcorn-for-one. Or even a bowl of soup or chili. Would definitely recommend these bowls!!"
Fantastic deep bowls perfect for ice cream cereal or that morning oatmeal! Deeper and more volume than most these really do come in handy.
"We needed to replace a similar-sized set that got constant use for many years. The Dowan bowls were the exact size of the set we needed to replace. I was a bit concerned about the tapered lip on the bowls but quickly found that wasn't an issue at all. In fact, that design feature gives the bowls a contemporary look compared to the retro look of our older bowls.  The Dowan bowls are sturdy and attractive. They've become our go-to instead of reaching for one of the surviving members of the original set."
"I ordered these bowls a few weeks ago, only four at that time. They arrived well packed and was so pleased I ordered another eight! They are a well designed deep bowl, ideal for soups and stews and even a salads. The first thing I noticed is how the thick the base of the bowl is thinning out as it reached the lip. Because of that it keeps the contents warm or cold longer. The clean design makes compliment any that is served in it, as well any table setting it is used with. Very pleased and looking forward to adding more of this company's products to my home."
"I prefer a deeper bowl to a wide shallow bowl. I have been looking for awhile on and off so when I saw this one I liked the look of it and felt the size would work well for my needs. After receiving the bowls not only were they the perfect size but I really love the look. I make a lot of frozen veggie bags and they fit perfectly in this bowl. I use them constantly. They are very easy to clean and although they do get hot in the microwave, it is no problem removing them. I immediately bought another set for a gift. I can't say enough good things about these bowls."
"This dish is great for using in microwave and dishwasher. This size, 30 ounces, is great because it holds a full meal of pasta, oatmeal, stew or salad without having to overfill a smaller bowl. I originally got the 22 ounce version and it was simply too small. It's easier to have a larger bowl and underfill it than a smaller bowl that overflows."
"Accidentally football touchdown slammed one of the bowls super hard with force to the floor after it had been soaking in hot water, slipped out of my hands and my clumsy butt made it land 100x harder and it didn't chip, crack or anything. I was happily surprised. We love them for ice cream, cereal, soups, chili. They're nice and deep. They are not great if you need space saving stackable type of bowls as you can see but that was never even part of my consideration for buying them. I would definitely recommend them. Picture of them stacked in my messy cabinet next to a salt shaker for size reference. Lol"
This is my second order from Dowan. I was extremely happy with my first set of smaller bowls that I ordered .I went on line the next day ordered these which is a slightly larger bowl. The quality seem very good and based on the weight of the bowls I think they will last. I will be ordering additional products from Dowan until I have all matching white sets. Seems like a great product and good value.
"Contemplating buying a blue set. These are great bowls. I love the depth as I like to eat a lot of curries, soups, ramen etc and like room left over at the top. These are perfect size and not enormous or impractical to store. Additional plus, they were packaged very well. I always hesitate buying dishware online as I have had a few bad experiences with items arriving broken."
"So. I eat lots of soup and getting it safely to the table and chair has become more difficult as I age. These bowls are nice and deep allowing for less sloshage (yes, that is a word). I tried lots of other bowls but this one is the best. It also feels good in your hand. Combined with a nifty bowl cozy and you are good to go. Go for it."
"Gave these as a Christmas gift to my adult daughter, who was visiting from out of state. All of us were impressed at the quality (porcelain beats plastic!), the heavy-duty feel, and the great capacity. My daughter thinks she could put an entire box of Mac 'n' Cheese in a bowl; I like the thought of it for ramen or pho. They really do look as advertised; if you like how they seem online, you'll like them in real life!"
"Perfect size for eating cereal or rice, great quality. Its very thick and I really love it that way, and because of the thickness it makes me feel that it won't randomly break on me at random times. I don't have a dishwasher, but when I hand clean it, it doesn't slip out of my hands and after just a few minutes, its looks new and looks as if I just ordered it and wiped it a few million times. The other bowls I have usually have a scratch or two after a while of use, but this bowl I have been using for a few months name and its still shiny and looks brand new. Definitely Worth Buying!"
My microwaved oatmeal kept flowing over the edge of a standard bowl size but these are super tall and keep my oatmeal in check. They are standard enough looking to go with our other white (these are a little off white but not too noticeable) dishes if we need larger with meal time. Very pleased.
"When making oatmeal in the microwave, I had to constantly stop cooking and stir in order to avoid spill overs. With these deep bowls, the oatmeal rises up and circulates in the bowl, but never spills over. That was my primary reason for buying them. In addition to using them for oatmeal, it is a nice looking, functional bowl for all other purposes. I will donate my original bowls and use these instead."
"Just what I wanted, a deep bowl. It has a nice rounded shape and tall sides. Fits well in the hand and doesn’t conduct heat into the bowl itself so it’s too hot to handle. (I had some bowls that must have had a metal in the glaze and would get hotter outside than the food inside). I liked them so much that I ordered a second set. They come in a well packed and padded box."
They are SO easy to wash- machine or by hand. I've had them for almost a year and never had ANY problems with them. The little stamp on the bottom that tells you who created them did wash off but it doesn't affect the product at all. It holds a lot which I wanted for soups and cereals.  They easily stack and are a good weight too so they don't slide around or easily tumble over.  I will definitely buy more from this brand in the future!
"These were not the bowls I wanted, they are a larger, but now I have them they are indispensable to me. If I'm feeling greedy they make an excellent soup bowl. They are large enough to prep a salad for two in and then put it on the table. Perfect for serving a side dish or for holding leftovers.I They are sturdy, and are safe to use in the microwave, regular oven, and dishwasher. Made in China they are 5 3/4 across the top and 31/2 top to bottom."
"The bowls are much better than the standard IKEA stuff - also, they can be microwaved and do not apparently come out hot to the touch, which was surprising. They are stout and rugged as well - so far much better than the 365 bowls I originally had from IKEA which have chipped and shattered over the years."
I bought these at my son’s request for a deep bowl to microwave oatmeal or Mac and cheese that would not splatter. These work very well with double servings. They are thick and hold the heat so be careful handing the bowl.
"This is such a perfect size - standard bowls are always too small and shallow, making it easy for stuff to slosh over. These are deep, sturdy, and hold a generous portion. We threw all our other bowls out after getting these. Exactly what we wanted!"
The Bowles are great but the Amazon person that delivered this order was flaky. The order was left in the driveway by a bush that we could not see. That's the first time an order was not left by or Infront the door.
"I bought these bowls in hopes of microwaving soups rather than using a pot on the stove. The bowls are certainly large enough for any canned soup.  My biggest issue is that these bowls get very very hot in the microwave. Maybe whatever they are made of is supposed to get hot, but consider yourself warned. They get super hot. Oven mitts are a necessity if you microwave the bowls."
"Bowls arrived in a timely manner and were packaged extremely well. I had searched for the perfect size of bowl for awhile, and these didn't disappoint. They will serve as cereal and snack bowls as well as offer large portions of soup, rice, and pasta. They are deep and large without feeling too clunky or heavy. They also stack nicely and seem durable. Size is about 5 3/4"" in diameter and about 3 1/2"" high. Would recommend."
SO far so good. These were packaged great and came all in one piece not even one crack on them! they hold 1000ml of liquid which makes them almost look deceiving! They will store well in the cupboard as they stack nicely. Seems like this was a great buy so far! And they were half off regular price :)
"These bowls are a perfect size for salad, soup or pasta. They are heavy duty but at the same time attractive. They are also a good value."
"Love these bowls!!! My husband makes a lot of soups and stews and we eat a lot of stir fry dinners, and needed good sturdy deep bowls that would assist us in our food adventures. These are awesome and came really well packed. Super durable and made very well. Might have to get another set!"
"These bowls are great. Deep enough for chili/soups, and they wash up great in the dishwasher. They are not too thin, but not the clunky pottery type either. Just look at the measurements provided to make sure they’re the size you want. I am very happy customer."
"Product is well made and was well packed for delivery. The perfect sized cereal/ oatmeal bowl. They con you into a free gift then make you post a review, and if you don't post a picture of your product they don't allow you to complete the process for the free gift after purchase... (Didn't like this)"
I really like them. This is my 2nd order. Lesser bowls chip. I've never seen any of this brand chip. They're thick too so they hold in the heat of you're using them for soup.
These are some big bowls. Most bowls are too small and are easy to spill. First thing I had was a big bowl of chili and I didn't need to refill for seconds. Also easy to clean in dishwasher.
"I bought these bowls because I needed deeper bowls than the ones I already owned, and because they matched my white dishware. They have worked great. Super deep and nothing spills out."
"The set of four bowls was exactly what I was looking for: Exactly the right size to hold a decent amount without any worry of spillage; solid and well-made. A simple, classic design that will get daily personal use and I'd be glad to use with guests. And when I inevitably drop one, I'm betting unlike some other bowls and plates I've owned, it just might survive the drop! Can't go wrong with these."
Delighted with the bowls - very easy to have soup without it spilling as bowls are deep and keeps the soup warm until one can eat the last bite. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to clean and they stack nicely in cabinet.
It was hard to find a bowl deep enough to microwave oatmeal in. Still have to cover it. The bowls that came with lids- lids weren't microwavable.
"My new Dowan bowls are strong yet inexpensive and look great. Best of all, they keep hot dishes like soup nice and hot for the time that soup is in them!"
"These bowls are just what I wanted, classic looking ,white, and large ... I use them for soups and cereal, they are large enough for soups because you can add crackers, etc. to it, and there Is Room at the Top. They stack well, and are beautiful !!!!!"
"I make a lot of soups, chili, and rice meals and these bowls met my immediate needs. Not too heavy, but just right. Not a perfect color match for my Ikea dinnerware, but the price was right."
"These bowls are adequate size and are good deep bowls. They are especially useful for chili, soup or cereal. They arrived timely and were well packed."
"We love the bowls. The size is great! The only thing that we have a little problem with is that the glaze can be a little slippery. Also, when you microwave with them, you will need to use a hot pat to take them out of the microwave. We use them all the time."
"These bowls are exactly what I wanted. However both delivered packages had one bowl broken. The package was undamaged but one bowl inside was broken. As I said, these are great bowls but the packaging needs to be looked at."
"A bowl is a bowl, and not much more can be said. But I like these bowls a lot, and prefer them to glass bowls. They stack nicely in the cupboard, are easy to clean, and look attractice."
"The eggs shell bowels were large and surprisingly sturdy. Really look like the one on the pics, at least the white bowels I ordered. Very happy!"
I really like these bowls. They are heavy enough to keep from knocking them over. I love the blue color. I actually bought these for my cats but I liked them so much that my cats lost out on the deal. Very easy to clean too
"My husband and I love these bowls. They are heavy and well-made. They are deep and large. We bought them because we needed some more large bowls. We enjoyed the ones we already have, and found these to be far superior. You will not be disappointed in this purchase."
I am a college student and my dorm doesn’t have a dishwasher. They are beyond easy to clean by hand and are perfect for any need.
They're smaller than expected but perfect for most everything since they're deep. I like the weight and the look of them. And the gift offer is a nice touch as well as a personal note from the seller. I would love to buy another set.
"These are great bowls. They are deep and perfect for cereal, soups and salads. They arrived in excellent packaging. I am extremely pleased with these and my wife and daughter love them!"
"These bowls are heavy but not thick. They work well in the microwave and dishwasher. I've found that they are great for soup. mac and cheese, oatmeal etc. If you are looking for large capacity bowls these are the bomb."
"My husband loves these bowls! The large size is perfect for a hearty appetite. The photo is the large bowl next to a standard bowl (different brand). We purchased four and are ready to buy more of this clean, sturdy, deep bowl."
This Louisiana girl has been looking for years for the perfect gumbo bowls and I think I just found them. These will be perfect for gumbo and soup this winter! Looking forward to a cold front so we can use them.
Just the right volume for Bowl of hot soup or stew. also great for a healthy amount of ice cream. easy to clean and looks good in my cabinet.
There are a lot of similar products out there. I chose this one in white and we use them all the time. The shipping packaging kept the bowls secure and safe.
"These bowls, made in China, are just what I was looking for because shallower bowls, when cooking cereal in microwave, splatter cereal. The bowls were very well packaged to ensure against breakage."
"Bought them to microwave oatmeal. They’re perfect, no overflows. Also great for soup."
"These bowls are perfect for those of us that do not want to make a second trip back to the kitchen for soup, chili or cereal. Nice deep bowls that are easy to clean and hold up well with 3 teenage boys"
Our bowls for our set were an odd shape and not great for heating cereal etc in the microwave. These bowls are fantastic. We love them
"These bowls were exactly as described and as expected. I wanted a study, good-quality, deep bowl - I got all three things in these bowls! I would highly recommend and would purchase again."
"I love these bowls! I needed a deep bowl for cereal, soups, chili, etc, and this is it! They’re very sturdy and nice looking. They blend in nicely with my existing dinnerware. Great purchase!"
"These bowls hold a lot! They are super easy to clean, they last long, and they are very sturdy. 10/10 recommend!"
very sturdy and easy to clean. You won't regret purchasing these IMO.
"I use this for soap making. It's a nice, hefty bowl with a pour spout (!!) and tab handle that won't break from the weight of the batter. (This must be a redesign because I saw a pic and some other reviews about a different kind of handle.) It should hold 10 pounds of soap but I haven't tried making that much batter in this container, although six pounds fits just fine with plenty of room left over. This bowl handy to store other items like smaller bowls and cups used in the soaping process. It's wider than it is tall, so it doesn't contribute to arm fatigue."
"It may sound a bit silly but the OXO Good Grips mixer bowl is as close to perfect for the task as I could imagine. The gripping surfaces on the rim and bottom allow perfect stabilization of whatever you may be mixing including thick bread dough. 5 quarts is a bit more than I need but is not too big for convenient storage, either. Quite affordable even for this retiree. I would recommend this to friends."
"There are a few things I've purchased over the past year that have turned out to be really great and this is one of them. I broke my elbow when I was a kid and now have arthritis in it. I'd been using a glass mixing bowl when I was baking but it was heavy, awkward and uncomfortable when it came time to pour the batter into the pans. This bowl is easy to lift and it even has a nice rubber handle to grip and a lip to allow batter to pour out smoothly. It's an easy clean up - either wash by hand or stick in the dishwasher."
"For the price, I love it. I live in a small apartment, and this is my only mixing bowl, so I use it almost daily. I was happy with the price, as I find most OXO products, overpriced fo the quality. I like the quality of this bowl though. I may get another in a smaller size, so it will nest inside this larger one."
"Some of the most famous & popular mixing bowls for cooks and bakers these days are $50 & up in this great size, This bowl is a small fraction of that price and is great quality, is very light, and has a great nonslip base. The only thing missing is a lid & I really miss that but will use a silicone topper instead. I haven't tried anything really messy like an tomatoes based based dish with oil or fat that might stain & I don't have a dishwasher but in all other ways all thumbs way up for this for many other of the attractive often black & white wonderfully engineered products from OXO."
"I really like this oversized bowl. It is great for mixing up casseroles when you need a large size bowl. I also use it to soak veggies in to make sure they are clean, especially broccoli with a little salt in the water. I think it is a great addition to my kitchen."
"I love this bowl. I had one for years and then ruined it when I used it to catch drips for a month and it yellowed. I immediately ordered a new one. It's so much lighter than dealing with glass, the quality of the material is delightfully smooth to the touch, and the pour spout, handle, and rubber bottom make it perfect for mixing or stirring. I liked it so much I bought two other sizes of OXO mixing bowls."
"This is perfect for a jumbo mixing bowl. I have a glass set but the handmixer doesn't like the ridges in it. This bowl works great with a handmixer and/or spatula. Perfect for mixing cake batter, cookies, brownies, you name it. It doesn't slip around on the countertops and is easy to wash and clean. I'd recommend it."
"OXO's five-quart mixing bowl is an excellent product and an excellent value. I have a lot of OXO products and have been very pleased with the utility, durability, and affordability of them all. This bowl is no exception: it is very large and holds most anything you could want it to in a home kitchen; it has a built in pouring spout, which really comes in handy, and is ergonomically shaped for ease of use.  My favorite feature of the bowl is the non-skid surface on the bottom (and handle) of the bowl. It sits on the counter and has absolutely no inclination to move or tip over during any kind of reasonably expected preparation method, including vigorous beating or stirring. The bowl is not microwave safe, and being plastic, may not be ideal for some uses at high temperatures. The bowl is a bargain, is lightweight, and has lots of handy features. I like it so much I'm going to get the three-quart bowl too, as the five-quart bowl is larger than I need for many applications."
"bought a 3 quart which was okay, but for use of my mixer which splatters tomato sauce everywhere needed this deeper bowl. also this bowl is perfect for making a batch of dough of four cups. i think any larger, of a bowl, for the average - sized person, would be too big to manage holding in one arm and using the mixing machine with the other."
"Very sturdy mixing bowl, with rubber bottom for stability and ""stick."" Purchased for lye solution. No wear yet after multiple uses and it stands up to the heat well!"
"Like the companion 5qt (and 3qt if we could find one in stock LOL), this is an excellent bowl to have. The non-skid base and handle really make this product special. It pours nicely - it's actually perfect for mixing up a batch of waffle or pancake mix and pouring directly onto the griddle.  We do a lot of cooking and have an extremely well-stocked kitchen including a set of glass pyrex bowls in varying sizes and a set of stainless bowls in varying sizes. More and more, we find ourselves reaching for these Oxo bowls to meet our mixing needs.  With plastic, using a hand mixer or immersion blender is always iffy. Thus far, these have held up very well to the wear of the beaters. We're very anxious to obtain the 3qt size and are so impressed with the quality, we may just buy the 5qt/3qt/1.5qt set so we can have each size, and having double of the largest and smallest will NOT be a waste. Great purchase!"
"I don't have space for a stand mixer but I like lots of room for my dough to be created. I don't like a mess and even though the 5 quart is a tad too big and perhaps hard to wash afterwards since it takes the entire sink, it is very useful, sturdy and keeps dough inside. When I pull this bowl out, I feel happy because I know I am going to bake. :) You know OXO, the black rubber is like a car tire and will keep steady and the white plastic super strong. I wish they had this in pink but frankly, as boring as it looks, this will never die on me and is the best for making dough. Cleans so nicely with just water but of course, detergent must be use. Dries up in minutes too! :) If I had money, I would buy all sizes. Worth every penny and makes great wedding gifts guys! :D"
We had the three bowl set and accidentally melted the largest one by leaving it on top of an electric oven and not realizing how how the range top got. I’m glad I was able to replace our melted blue 5qt bowl with a black one here for a good price
"i have steel bowls, ceramic bowls, glass bowls, copper bowls, melamine bowls, pinch bowls, finger bowls... lots of bowls. i got these OXOs and now i kept the copper, the ceramic, and my OXOs: 2 5-qt, 1 3-qt, 2 1.5-qt, and 8 1-cup prep bowls (with lids!). these OXO bowls are workhorses easy to hold and clean. they are light and quiet (they don't bang on your counter).  notes: *not for dishwashers. *clean with soft cloth or sponge if you are trying to keep the surface scratch-free. *like any plastic bowls, metal spoons, beaters, or knives will abraid the surface.  if you are in production mode in your kitchen having a few of each of these bowls will make the job easier. buy them buy the bag.  1 cuppers are here:"
"I bought one and love it so much. I use it for hand washing in my very large kitchen sink. I don't have to plug the sink. Now I have one for my laundry room sink and the large sink in the bar. I do not leave them in the sink. I pull it out from the bottom of the cabinet, use it and when done -- put it back where I have it stored. To me, it is a perfect size for most hand washing."
(written by Mrs. Carl) I ordered the five quart bowl because I make double batches of cookies when I bake. I love the rubber bottom because I have a bad habit of putting bowls where they might tip or fall. I can balance this bowl almost anywhere with no fear that it will lose its grip. The rubber handle makes it easy to hang on to while mixing and/or turning. I don't use the spout but it is nice that it is on there. My husband has started using it when he makes bread and he loves it. I am going to throw out all my cheap bowls that I used to use. This bowl also washes up so easily! I never thought I would gush about a mixing bowl but I know this one will last for years. You can easily make three or four batches of cookies in this bowl. Don't even think twice about ordering this item - it is worth it at twice the price.
"I use bowls a lot for baking, but recently I burnt popcorn into the plastic of my old cheap one, so I figured I'd better buy one that is specifically microwave safe. Thankfully this is, also, the rubber bottom and handle makes for amazing grip, and the rubber also helps dampen the sound of a spoon on the bowl."
An excellent product from OXO brand. It is very sturdy due to the rubber bottom and also easy to clean. My only issue is that although it is wide that it is not quite tall enough for good mixing with a hand held mixer. It can also be put in the top rack of the dishwasher.
Much easier to work with and handle vs. glass bowls. Positions well on counter. Perfect height for hand held beaters.
"If you have to restrict yourself to one bowl to serve many uses, this would be the one. I bought it specifically to mix dog biscuits so I can make a double batch easily and especially wanted something that would not slide across the counter while I mixed the dough. This is perfect -- sturdy, well made, but yet lightweight, easy to clean ------- can also be used for mixing salads, marinating meat, serving popcorn, etc. It is large, but not cumbersome. Would highly recommend and can't beat the price for such a versatile item. Once you've used this, you won't want to use your glass bowls again."
Great for bottom watering plants
"I LOVE this bowl, and use it every week. It cleans very easily and can't be hurt."
"Excellent, well thought through design! I love the black non-slipping bottom and the same material on one side for a good grip, it makes the mixing process very easy. The bowl is light weight, and very easy to clean. The best bowl I have ever had!"
Truly enjoy this mixing bowl. Always makes me smile when I break this out because the job is about to be taken care of. Great product at a great pricepoint.
"Love this simple and yet perfectly designed, light mi ins bowl! Tough, not noisy when mixing nor when shuffling around in cabinet. Easy grip. Pour spout. What’s not to love"
There’s nothing bad about it I just work in a small space able to work with it
bought this as a replacement for my metal mixing bowls because they were leaving scratches on my new quartz countertops. LOVE it! It does not slip and is a perfect weight for using a hand held mixer. Clean up is super easy too!
I really like this icing bowl. It's big and the bottom is non skid. Very sturdy and practical.
"Large capacity, easy to handle, light weight. Love it."
"I bought this mainly for mixing potatoes and it works great. I love the rubber bottom, it helps the bowl stay in place and I love how big it is!"
This is a versatile product. I bought mine because I needed a bowl large enough to hold my fermenting sourdough starter. You would find this perfect for doubling baking recipes.
"A very nice and large mixing bowl. Not a typical plastic bowl, but a quality kitchen bowl. Impressive skit resistant bottom."
"I bought this bowl online to save me the trip to the store, but it had scratches on the inner surface and on the black rubber base. I am guessing Amazon sent me a returned item, but I am not returning it as well because I do not want to spend more time on it. I am planning to buy the other two bowls to complete the set, but this time I will go to the store.  I give it 5 stars because the bowl is excellent and I do not think the scratches are Oxo's fault, but Amazon's for not doing the appropriate checking before sending it to me."
"i'm so glad to have this bowl. it's perfect for popcorn or as a mixing bowl. it's sturdy and really easy to hold. i had a bit of an unrelated problem, and amazon customer service was incredibly helpful - amazingly so. i highly recommend both this bowl and amazon!"
"Very nice, sturdy, and light weight. The handle on it is perfect when pouring out the batter or whatever your making. It makes it so much easier. Happy I got it."
I used the mixing bowl to make a pecan cake that turned out delicious.
"This bowl is awesome - it is a little wider and less deep than I had pictured, but it is large enough to suit my general baking needs (batch of cookies, etc.) - able to use my cheapie hand mixer that doesn't have a slow speed on it - without flinging batter everywhere. Nice, heavy rubbery plastic....with rubbery grip and bottom....I will be buying more of these in all sizes. If you're looking for a decent quality bowl for a good price, regardless of planned usage, this is one I would recommend."
"I love the grip edge on this bowl and the fact that it has a lip for easy pouring. It's also the perfect size, very large. It somehow seems larger than my other 5 quart mixing bowl."
"I love, love, love this mixing bowl. I was looking for a bowl that was large enough to make big batches of potato salad, pasta salad, mixing meatloaf ingredients, well, lots of one bowl meal type of things. I have plenty of small and med size mixing bowls, and just needed 1 all purpose large one. Couldn't be happier with it. It's easy to clean, the non-skid bottom helps keep it in place while mixing/stirring, and it's just the perfect size. Nothing will be too large for it!!"
I have a Tupperware bowl that is ancient and worn that is the oerfect bowl for mixing anything and everything. It is no longer available. I always keep an eye out for a replacement. One day at work a close friend was complaining her favorite bowl was about to bite the dust. I bought two of these one for her and one for me. NOT sorry! Almost same size and shape but actually improved with non skid bottom and side grip. Pour spout is another bonus. Two happy cooks.
"this is the perfect size for mixing up anything that doesn't need a huge bowl, but big enough to mix brownies, biscuits, pancake mix, etc. It's sturdy, and has a nice feel to it, and cleans up easily. It's just perfect, and I love it!"
These mixing bowls are a nice size. I was so tired of the “two small” bowls. It’s ok if a mixing bowl is too big; but it is a real drag when your mixing bowl is too small!!!
Nice bowl for the price: for mixing and sifting.
We have many oxo products. Good stuff
Cant go wrong with OXO products. This is a perfect size bowl for everyday use.
"Perfect bowl for baking, whipping up cookies or cake batter. It even catches all the batter that my crappy beaters flick everywhere! Rubber bottom is a bonus too, so it doesn't slip when I'm using it, but most of all I love that it's dishwasher safe."
Sturdy. Has handle to hold while mixing. Base keeps it sturdy while mixing . Yes buy it
What can I say this has become my go to mixing bowl. Light weight but sturdy and no slip bottom and grip up top. This bowl fit perfect for my needs.
This bowl is very easy to work with when I am making cakes. The rubber on the bottom is very helpful. I have not used this in the dishwasher so I cannot speak on its durability.
Durable high quality mixing bowl
This is a sturdy mixing bowl with a nice grip feature on the top to get better hold of it. I am not a baker by nature and use a hand mixer so it was helpful to have hold of the bowl with that non-slip grip. Easy to clean
"This bowl is great for making pasta salad, large batches of cookie dough and casserole type dishes. I love all of OXO products."
Sturdy and lightweight. Thankyou
My bowls sit on the top shelf and having a nice lightweight bowl is a great asset. Washes easily and it really is very lightweight and sturdy.
Favorite bowl to use when I'm baking or making pizza dough.... its a perfect size and it's easy to clean
"I suffer from a weakness in my hands, which makes gripping and holding most bowls steady very difficult for me - usually I have to use both hands, which makes mixing ingredients a real problem. This product is perfect for me. The rubber bottom holds the bowl nicely in place for me (so I can hold it steady with one hand and mix with the other) and it's wonderfully large so that even if I do tip it a little, the contents do not spill all over the place."
"I really like these mixing bowls. Easy to hold, grasp and they do not slip and slide all over the place. I bought the smaller ones years ago along with these larger ones. They are the best. So much so that after leaving the large bowls with the ex during the divorce I missed them so much that I bought these replacements. Now we are happy again... I mean me and my bowls...."
"This is inexpensive, light in weight, easy to clean, large, easy to hold, and easy to pour from. I use it for almost everything -- from pancakes to homemade soy milk."
"Don’t often need a large bowl, but when I do it’s perfect....light weight and love the gripping handle."
These are the best bowls! Easy to use and last forever. I have several in all sizes. Great for so many uses. My favorite popcorn bowl and my granddaughter uses them in her playhouse to “cook” with. Can’t break them!
"I love most OXO products and this bowl has not failed to please. Just a very functional bowl for when you are making a big meal (holidays, parties, group functions, etc.) and need multiple bowls in play. It's a great bowl to have!"
Wonderful mixing bowl. The spout makes it easy to pour and with a rubber spatula easy to get all the liquid out. I just use wooden spoons or rubber tools as I don't want to scratch the insides. Heavy duty and the rubber bottom keeps the bowl from scooting around. The rubber at the top edge makes it easy to hold and also pour without losing your grip. Great addition to the kitchen tools.
"Large mixing bowl, very sturdy and easy to clean"
Very nice mixing bowl with built in pour spout.
As advertised
I really like this bowl. Got it for my dad and used it with him and now I want one for Christmas
Actually use this as a dishpan. The non-slip bottom ensures it stays put in the bottom of the sink. It’s big enough to use for the purpose. Easy to clean. Works well.
"I thought it was a bit overpriced at first, but it is very sturdy and very well made."
I bought two of these bowls to replace two other bowls that were left behind during a military move. We have no regret for buying these...they are very strong and the feel of the bowls makes you wanna mix the heck out of whatever you are mixing. I use the to make mashed potatoes in...my wife for whatever else needs mixing.  And the rubber grip on the bottom helps to prevent sliding on our granite countertops.
"We purchased these a week ago, as you see they are plant based..... we opened the package and began using them. The next day as we went deeper in the package we noticed little specs in the bowls, that started moving! Upon further research we found out that they were grain beetles, VERY small beetles that feed off of plants, grain and other items, and they are transported through infected manufacture factories. We’ve been fighting this infestation from the bowls for days now. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
I've used these bowls in situations where I thought I shouldn't. I was afraid they were going to leak or crumble but they didn't. They're strong.
"Held up well to milk n cereal. Very sturdy, no soggyness."
Useful.
Heated food in microwave and the bottom fell out. Not recommend for any hot food. Nice bowl just can’t trust it with hot food
Every other bowl had a hole… made for interesting mornings when I wasn’t paying attention making the kids cereal
Don't serve anything oil based or too hot in them. They let the heat out and they let the liquid soak through leaving behind stains on clothing.
"You can't get these wet at all or they quickly fall apart. The problem with that is most food is wet! There's absolutely no waterproofing or resistance with this product at all. Do not attempt to eat anything in these that is wet or damp at all. No sauces, yogurt, liquids, or anything damp. I tried mixing yogurt with a few things including a small shot of cream and the bowl quickly fell apart and made a mess. Horrible product. I got these from Whole Foods through Amazon Prime and I just have to wonder what the heck they're thinking carrying these? Please take them off the shelves and replace something that can actually handle some liquid!"
"These are expensive, soak up all liquid and annoying. I know saving the planet is a good thing but honestly, I'd rather buy my paper plates elsewhere, rinse them off and recycle them. I used these these to feed my cat. They are sturdy but soak up all the liquid kitty's love in their cat food. Will not buy again. Waste of money."
Nice sturdy bowls and love that they are eco friendly!
Not a fan and will not purchase again.
The best bowls I've ever bought. They don't have these in the stores. At least I can't find them. These are awesome. They hold 20 ounces which is great but let me tell you these bowls are very durable. You can fill the bowl up with water for your pet and the water won't leak through the bottom - at least it hasn't for me. Now other bowls that I've bought at stores leak horribly. They flatten out like a paper plate. But these don't. These are the dream of bowls.
"It's so hard to give this a rating. I WANT to give it a ONE star, but it's not the fault of the product itself that where they are kept in the Amazon warehouse makes them absorb the disgusting detergent and air freshener around them. I have to air these things out before we can use them. They arrived July 18, 2020, and it's now September 12, 2020. They STILL reek. :( I have to spread each bowl out individually in separate areas to ""air out"" so that whatever food is put in those bowls doesn't taste like air freshener. Forget using cereal or something that contains a liquid or you'll be drinking pure air freshener. It's so disgusting, and as someone with chemical sensitivities for 25+ years now, this has been a horrible experience. So, do I give it a 5 because what can go wrong with a disposable bowl right? Or do I give it a 1 because Amazon stores these where they absorb the highly scented odors around them? We're supposed to rate on the actual product, NOT something that is out of control of the product itself. It'd be like giving it a 1 because UPS damaged them. That makes no sense. Shipping issues are a whole different problem. Just know if you get these, they very well may be unfit for use. Pretty sure even ""normal"" people that aren't sensitive or allergic to chemicals shouldn't be eating them!"
"These are the best paper bowls I've used. They are study and durable for one time use. They are also slightly deeper than the heavy duty store/off brand bowls.  I ordered these from Amazon's Warehouse, 156 bowls for $15.45. The box arrived damaged, but the packaging around the bowls was in tact.  Note: paper bowls should NOT be used for longer time periods when contents are liquids -- the bowl will begin to breakdown and leak.  So NOT good as potted plant container for protection of excess water drainage or short term storage of soup or cereal."
I love using disposable bowls since I eat a lot of soup and I've found these are the perfect size for most cans of soup and they hold up perfectly to use in the microwave. I've found I can microwave two bowls worth of food and the bowls are still perfectly sturdy. I highly recommend.
"Our household doesn't do dishes...there I said it. We use Dixie paper plates and paper bowls along with plastic knives, forks, and spoons. I have a lot of health issues, including allergies, and doing dishes is the last thing we have time for. We love Dixie Ultra Bowls because they are durable and affordable.  Dixie Ultra Bowls are the thicker of the two types of paper bowls that Dixie makes. The other paper bowls are called Dixie Everyday Bowls and they are much thinner. These bowls hold 20 ounces each and come packaged in packs of 26 bowls. You receive a total of 6 packs of bowls for a total of 156 bowls.  The design on the bowls themselves changes constantly, sometimes it matches the picture on Amazon and sometimes it doesn't, but the bowls are always the same. I prefer the blue patterns because they match our home, but seriously you throw them away after each use so that doesn't really matter.  We use these bowls for everything! They are perfect for hot foods. We primarily use them for pasta dishes and rice dishes. The heat will go through the bottom of the bowl if the food is really hot, so we generally double the bowls while using them, and then keep the bottom bowl to reuse next time around.  We also use these bowls for snacks like pretzels and cookies as well as ice cream. The bowls are strong enough that they don't bend under the weight of ice cream covered in chocolate syrup even as the ice cream starts to melt. They can also hold the weight of ice cream with toppings.  These bowls are microwave safe. We cook using them in the microwave all the time with the microwave on high. They will hold up for as long as 8 minutes in the microwave, anything beyond that and they start to lose their shape. That is with the microwave set on the highest setting.  The bowls are cut resistant so when you stab a fork in the bowl to pick up a piece of meat, you don't get punctures in the bottom of the bowl which is really nice. They have a soak proof shield which prevents them from leaking, even if you are eating something like cold cereal with milk.  I love that these bowls are available on Amazon, all though sometimes they are cheaper at the big box stores in our area. The designs on the bowls from Amazon are usually different than the designs on the bowls sold in our area, but the bowls are the exact same quality.  There are lots of paper bowls on the market, but Dixie is hands down our household's favorite brand."
"I'm not one to normally purchase or use paper products such as bowls, cups or plates as it is cheaper to use glass or plastic ones and wash them after use. However, I caught myself in a bind for a gathering where I was elected to supply the plates and bowls. After spending time looking at different brands and checking reviews, I decided to try these. I was skeptical until we used them. The design on them are nice and they were larger than expected. They held up so much better than expected. NO LEAKS. Because they are so strong and sturdy I now keep them in my cupboard all the time for many other uses as well. Especially for the occasional times I get lazy and don't want to wash dishes."
These paper bowls are tough! You can eat anything in these bowls and they will not fail you. They also look very nice! What else can I say...they're great!
"I Absolutely love the fact that these are biodegradable & is a sturdy paper product that Does Not use Plastic! In fact they do have a type of slick surface, but yet made out of a paper source that is biodegradable & easy can be folded up & smashed in your hand to make more room in the trash can & are easier on the earth’s plastic problem. -Although, I did not look to see if they are a recycled paper product or if they are sustainably sourced. -I guess I still need to some more homework to make certain that these are truly in fact, still not harming the earth by deforestation. Sorry everyone, I’m still trying to get better at recycling & reducing my use on things that affect the earth & the animals. I am disabled so I like not having to wash dishes."
"We try to be environmentally friendly however we bought these anyway because I just can’t keep up with dishes. I priced one package of these at the grocery store and this was a huge cost saving. We really like these because they can go in the microwave, can pour hot or cold items in them, fluids can stay in there for hours even overnight and the bowls don’t get soggy. I read some reviews who said ppl wash them out and use them a second time. I think that’s not very sanitary personally and not something we would do but whatever floats your boat I guess. I ended up buying bowls, plates, paper towels, toilet paper and plasticware in bulk. Like our garage now has huge boxes like we are prepared to be locked in doors for a year in a blizzard. We live in Texas so that’s never going to happen. That being said not worrying about running to the store every week or month for these things has been such a stress saver. And after adding up what we would spend per month verses this stuff all lasting a year or even 6 months - we saved A LOT."
"THIS BOWL CAME IN HANDY FOR MANY USES BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTIVE, DURABLE AND REUSABLE. A SERVING BOWL OR INDIVIDUAL BOWL. 1. ITS FIRST USE WAS FOR HOT OR COLD CEREAL IN THE MORNING. 2. SOUP FOR LUNCH. 3. SALAD FOR LUNCH OR TO ACCOMPANY THE EVENING MEAL. 4. PASTA DISH. BOWLS OF POPCORN FOR FAMILY, FOR GUEST, AND DESSERTS! 5. DISHES WITH SAUCE. 6. ACTUALLY, ANY MAIN DISH FITS INTO THE BOWL. 7. CAKE, PIE, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, ICE CREAM, A FANCY SUNDAE. 8. BOWL OF CANDY ON THE TABLE. THIS WHOLE LINE OF PAPER GOODS ARE THE BEST! I GIVE THEM A 5 STAR PLUS!"
"I got hooked on these! They come in two sizes and these are the smaller ones… Sure makes for an easy snack grab. They are sturdy and the more you use them, you’ll not know how you got along without them!!! When the item you’re eating is too heavy for paper plates- these are a life saver. !!!"
"I try my best to not make that much waste, but just keeping it real, sometimes you just don't want to do dishes. Dixie bowls to the rescue! Seriously, they are very durable and we have yet to have a leak. They are perfect to keep on hand for art projects and parties as well. When we were entertaining, these bowls easily kept up from having a sink full of dishes when we would have company."
"Pretty good bowls I use them when I eat cereal, oatmeal, macaroni and cheese, and soup. I just have to be very careful that I don’t fill the bowls too high AND I use 2 bowls if I am eating something heavy - this Doesn’t bother me because when I’m finished eating the bottom bowl is perfectly fine and I can use it for something else."
Anything to make life easier when possible and I thought the price was pretty close to what I pay at the supermarket. These are pretty solid bowls for something made of paper. They would not be good enough for a bowl of soup or liquid but it takes a lot for something to seep thru.
I use only paper goods. Saves water and electricity and can be recycled. The quantity is great for those with big families and small. Strong and sturdy.
"After all these orders, month after month, year after year, after year, the quality of these bowls has consistently held up. Pandemic??? Whaaat pandemic; they just keep bangin' these bowls out, without a hiccup."
These are as sturdy as the bowls you can get in a grocery store or one of the warehouse clubs at a much better price than you get in either of those. And having them available as a subscribe and save item is very convenient.
"I like using paper bowls versus washing dishes. Call me lazy, but it's easier and with these bowls I don't feel guilty. They are not Chinette, so if that's what you're looking for, these aren't it. But these are terrific, disposable bowls at a great price, and a great time saver. If I heat something up in the microwave and the bowl seems a little softer, I just set that bowl inside another bowl."
"Dixie has my loyalty on this item. When I use them for salads, the dressing does not leak through. If it's something hot (like spaghetti), I double it up for extra safety, and the bottom bowl stays clean enough to be used again. I fold paper towels and put them in the bottom to drain artichoke hearts or smoked clams. Does not leak all over my refrigerator shelves. Worth every penny."
I hate cleaning cat food out of a bowl. I'm not being very eco friendly but I don't have a dishwasher and my cats should have clean dishes every day. So I toss the dirty bowl and have a fresh one to use. And my family uses them. Really cuts down on the dishes I have to hand wash.
"Since we've retired, and there's just the two of us, it takes a while to generate enough dirty dishes to make it worth filling the dishwasher, and it's just wasteful to run it 3/4 empty. So we use paper (recycle!) and these bowls are quite sturdy for paper. I have yet to worry if these bowls are going to make it through a meal. They hold a bowl of steaming chili, and stay solid while I add my shredded cheese and crackers. I can eat my breakfast cereal at my own pace, without wondering if the bowl will maintain its integrity while I eat. They're a good value, a renewable product, and Earth friendly. How can you go wrong?"
We're currently having a plumbing situation in our home and these bowls have been a lifesaver until we get up and going again with dishwashing.
"I like these bowls because they can serve many small items & save small amounts of food for leftovers. And for giving food to ppl/daughter for later to reheat. Their for snack holding. When in frig over night they may spread out/rim, but food is still intact & not spilled<<<mess saver."
"I normally buy these at the grocery store but the price for these was awesome, so much less than Walmart price. One pack is a little over 4 bucks at the store and I received 6 packs for much less when averaged out. I will be buying these again. I shared with an elderly friend who doesn't like to do dishes either! We use paper products everyday. The bowls are great for everything including soup."
"I live with a roommate who is, shall we say, less than fastidious about keeping the kitchen clean. There are times I don't know if she has washed something or not (it's a long story). When I'm in doubt, I use these bowls along with other disposable items to be sure that my OWN meal is sanitary. These stand up well in the microwave; they hold a fair amount, and don't soak through easily. For times when I can't clean the whole kitchen before I prepare my own meal, they are very reassuring to me."
I love these bowls They don’t leak while you are eating your cereal or ice cream. I originally bought them to feed my 2 cats. After my knee replacement having to wash a minimum of 4 bowls a day for just their wet food each day was difficult. Having to do physical therapy and all. Now my knee is healed and I find myself still using them. 😀
"Only having one hand, I use lots of throw-away products (plates, bowls, utensils) and Dixie has always been the best. Walmart has decided to make dixie an online product only, and replace with great value (Walmart's own brand name). Only problem was delivery. Amazon decided to combine two seperate orders into one while in transit, and made me wait extra days for delivery. Not sellers fault!"
"I've purchased this nice supply of Dixie Ultra Disposable Paper Bowls, 20oz, a couple of times. They are a great value. These bowls are sturdy and work perfectly for when we have a group over for chili or soup, even for our annual Monster Cereal Party at Halloween. Nice product."
Although I must admit I use paper plates everyday along with all paper and plastic I can to avoid using the dishwasher I do. This is the only brand I buy due to the fact they are good heavy strong plates. Costco has them cheaper but I don't always make runs to Costco so this is the second best as in price.
"If you don't want to deal with doing dishes, this paper bowl works great. It's sturdy and I feel OK about disposing it since it's NOT plastic. Highly recommended."
"I bought these for cereal, soup and salad bowls while on a 10 day family beach vacation in which I didn't want to spend time washing dishes. With 12 people total, including 7 kids there was a lot of cereal eating and milk left sitting in bowls... We went through over 100 bowls with not one leak or spill! Highly recommend!"
"Pretty standard paper bowls of a good quality and price. More importantly, they make a great base for making animal Loki crowns."
"Don't know what we would do without them, live in a small apartment with 2 people the dishes pile up, use these! Also good at my cottage where other people rent during the summer"
"I keep these on hand all the time for those days I don't feel like either washing dishes or loading the dishwasher. (I'm a senior citizen with a disability.) They're very handy, hold up well (even for soup), and biodegradable."
"I almost didn't rebuy these because the photo made it look like it might have a blue and red logo printed on it and I didn't trust that, but they are not printed on the inside and it is a simple green pattern which you can see on the bottom image. Great for oatmeal, beans etc. Very strong."
"We are remodeling our kitchen and without a dishwasher. We have tried several different disposable plates and bowls. These are by far the best. From soup to salad, the Dixie products are the best"
"this is exactly what I expected. It has been difficult to find in my area due to different shortages This is about what I would pay, maybe a couple of dollars higher .I am thrilled to get them as I normally use on a daily basis and they have been out of stock in the big box stores that I go to."
"These bowls are perfect! Most disposable bowls are just a little too small for a typical bowl of soup, cereal or salad. These are sturdy and perfectly sized. They do transfer heat so if I put soup in them, I do use one of my rubbermaid containers to “hold” it. I’ve found that for most dishes, this bowl is actually handier than a paper plate."
I never worry about these bowls I use them every day at home I am retired and doing dishes is not in my retirement plan so when I found these after trying others I have them on subscription
"Not too large and not too small. Very versatile due to sturdiness. We use it for soup, cereal, a drip catcher to put under the coffee cup of the morning, cup and tea bag holder, etc."
These bowls have a great sturdy texture and was able to hold double servings of saucy spaghetti for a family gathering. Definitely worth the price. I highly recommend
These Dixie 20oz bowls are the same ones that I usually pick up at the food store. The price here is much better in bulk. I like the 20oz as it is large enough to hold a can of soup or anything else that I ever serve. The coating holds up and does not get mushy.
"Great price if you need bowls in bulk and a great brand. Very sturdy and we love using them in our home. There isn't much to review, you are getting a quality product for cheaper than you can get at the store (my local stores anyway) and they are handy as can be. Will be a repeat buyer."
I have tried many paper bowls. I use paper plates and bowls (and plastic glasses) because I live by myself. It saves me from having to run the dishwasher with just a few dishes in it. I love these!
"Everything leaks through these , I think these are counterfeit, the same ones I get at the box stores except they dont leak ... buy them at Walmart not these"
"The best thing about the bowl is the size. It is not small and flimsy as so many disposable bowls are, so less problems with tipping or spilling. The price is okay and this is my go-to brand to use."
I used to buy these for ice cream only. But now I buy them for anything and everything I think I’ll always keep them on hand. They’re nice and sturdy. I like that.
"It is paper so fill and eat or we do find that these start to seap after a period of time like 30mins or so if liquid is left in them:) Otherwise sturdy and thick, not flimsy!:) LOVE"
"Just the right size for anything, we love the. A half sandwich and chips will go in them, as well as a bowl if cereal. Very versatile... great to have on hand for guests, easy cleanup and durable. Would like ‘Dixie’ to consider making plain white ones, as the colors don't really blend with anything we have."
"These were much more durable than I expected. Could handle everything. Material was nice and thick, didn't sog out in the microwave, and they didn't breakdown over time. Will buy again."
"I have used these particular bowls for many years. They are sturdy, leak proof, and can be used for a bowl of cereal to a hot bowl of stew."
Got these to hold more than the usual amount of soup at a church dinner. They also held up well to being carried to table.
I use these bowls for every meal because I live alone and hate doing the dishes. These bowls are made of paper so they don't hurt the environment when disposing. With this price I'm saving a lot of money by buying them in bulks compared to the retail prices.
These are sturdy enough for soup and other liquids. However I wouldn't let water sit too long. It will absorb and fall apart
"I really like these! Sturdy, leak proof and durable! Have no fuss about these paper bowls, use them daily! Quality is fantastic!! Price is right! Definitely a to all who use paper products!!"
"These have been a staple in our home for decades. It doesn't matter if it's hot soup or stew, they never disappoint!"
"These bowels are fantastic. I couldn’t find them in my local grocery stores so THANK YOU Amazon for having them in stock. They have so many uses: Snacks, Soup, Stew, Crafts... I will be buying again when these run out."
"In my opinion these are highest quality recyclable paper bowls on the market! They have never let me down regardless of what I have put in them. The per bowl cost is slightly more than their competitors, but then again I don't have any clean up cost that is included with the cheaper competitors! Thumbs up. 👍"
"I use these on our vacation with kids and grandkids as everyone eats lots of cereals for snacks. In previous years, the disposable bowls I bought were either too small or too flimsy. These were perfect and no one tipped their's over or had it collapse while they were carrying it to the table. I love them! Will buy next year!"
"Unlike other disposable bowls, these are a good size and can hold up to things like reheating soup in the microwave. They're a life saver for me because I am disabled and often don't have the energy to wash dishes."
"We have used these for many years and will continue to do so. They hold up very well to just about everything we throw at them. From ice cream to chili. They can tolerate being in the microwave for a little while, but I wouldn’t put them in for too long. We keep them in our house and in our camp trailer. They are a little smaller in size, but we we don’t mind."
"We use these for cereal and great for hot soups and chili. No leaks, very durable!"
"Sturdy, perfect size and great price!  Hard to find at my local grocery store so I purchase from Amazon, problem solved!"
Much sturdier than any low priced competitor. Holds up to hot soups and microwaved foods. Important disposable right now for me.
"A good product, however, I now have a lifetime supply. More bowls than I really need. As I accept my mistake, I will enjoy the product, never having to wash dishes again."
I love these bowls for the size and durability plus their leakproof properties. We use these every day. They don’t disappoint.
"Please keep in mind when you're handling products for the kitchen that the plastic wrapping is somewhat porous. I was disappointed at how heavily this item wreaked of what smells like hand sanitizer when I took each of the bowl groups out of the box. It is so strong on the top and bottom bowls (after unwrapping), I don't feel comfortable using them for fear of them being tainted with the stuff. I can only hope that it diminishes now that I have opened them. I am only voicing concern and frustration b/c I am very sensitive to the smell of hand sanitizer and other strongly scented items like it. Please remember that even though plastic is a barrier for most items, it can absorb something like a sanitizer that may be transferred by someone with it on who handles the product. Thank you."
These are my go-to bowls for cereal. The size is neither too small nor too big and great for microwaving soups and pasta.
Very sturdy great price compared to store bought that comes with small quantity
with the so called pandemic the stores near us ran out of paper products these work as a good replacement
I love these paper bowls. Can't find them in stores anymore. The new thing is bamboo bowls. They are like napkins and get soaked real fast. These bowls don't get soaked and are the perfect one serving size. I wash dishes by hand so this reduces that need. I rinse them out and store them for use them for fuel in the woodstove come winter.
"My fellow Costco regulars know that for some reason they no longer carry these small Dixie bowls, only the larger ones. My house doesn't have a dishwasher, so we use disposable plates and bowls whenever we can. We use this size constantly. These are the best disposable bowls, bar none, especially for wet stuff like cereal and chili. And this large multi-pack is the best deal. It might be as good as Costco used to be, or even better if you catch it at a discount.  Thank heavens for Amazon, is all I'm saying."
"Everything, we’re packaging to put our house on the market and this has been a wonderful time saver. Not only to assure our good China was packaged safely but that we also didn’t feel rushed to get the job done right."
"I like that these plates hold an ample amount of food or my party guests. And they have enough side to each plate so olives, cherry tomatoes and salad fixings or small veggies don't slip of edges. The depressed shape means gravy over meat or potatoes does run off plates. thickness is enough that no plastic plate holder has to be used. the value is same as buying at a big box store, but with the convenience of home delivery in bulk. There might be cheaper plates, but they aren't a better value."
"These are great for camping, for small snacks like salsa, nuts, ice cream or whatever. I mostly use them for my dog's canned food so that I don't have to constantly wash his metal food bowl (which is used for dry food). He has no problem getting to every bit of the food. I've even used them to make a ""Toppings Bar"" when we had a cookout with guests."
"I use these to feed my cats-- they *exactly* fit the bowl-holders that I found at a thrift-shop (the bowls were missing) and the cats seem happy with it. I used to buy them at the grocery store, but this is so much more economical. Recyclable, once you clean them out a bit. Good product!"
Great bowls at a great price - I do not know where the negative reviews came from!  I saw some of the negative reviews and almost didn't purchase these bowls. I am glad I didn't listen to them.  I received all of the bowls in the correct number and they are strong and sturdy. True Dixie value and as strong as the 20 ounce version!
"These are great to have on hand I use few a day for wet pet food, snacks for kids and so many other things. Can't beat price even at $ store. You get enough to last long, long time and they're conveniently wrapped in smaller useable stacks."
These bowls are sturdy and leak proof. I wanted small bowls for ice cream and small portions. These bowls were perfect.
"This is a great snack sized bowl for eating while watching tv. I've used it for nuts, M&Ms, Pirate's Booty and other snacky stuff. The quality is very good and it doesn't leak, so it can be used for liquidy things as well, such as dip, guacamole & salsa. Most often, I use these to feed my cat. It's the perfect size to empty his food into."
"We use to serve food and snacks to our childcare population. Toddlers showed us we made the right decision because if anyone can rip up paper they can. But not this product. We serve everything from ice cream to chili in these sturdy, durable, well made bowls."
"Nice size bowl that I find handy for desserts, fruits and such. Perfect for any informal occasion without the need for dish washing. I use them regularly so I like this big package."
"Great price to help me save money for my family. I hope the price doesn't increase the way so many other disposable products did after I initially bought them, trying to get me to pay more later on once I got hooked on their product. That doesn't work on me. I'll stop purchasing pronto, and find something else or do without. But I'll keep buying these if the price stays this reasonable."
"Lightweight and sturdy. Perfect kid size for cereal, soups, snacks or whatever! Saves your sanity from dishes piled-up when little kids are home all day or all your grand kids are visiting."
"For some reason these small bowls have disappeared from the grocery store. I use them to feed my cats, I have a holder they fit perfectly in. Good quality dish, perfect size for my use."
I Like them. They are small but they are fine for soups and most things ill use them for. I may buy them again good price.
"Love these bowls… please recycle!! They are great, sturdy…a must have. They can handle a huge dollop of lasagna or a bowl of cereal!!"
"That's mostly what I use these for. They can handle the hot water I add to my dog's freeze dried raw food. They still look brand new when he's done. I could probably reuse them once or twice, but I don't. Surprisingly sturdy for paper bowls, and the price works for me."
"Got it through open box so I got a really good deal. Heavy enough for our breakfast cereal, heaping mash potatoes, soup. And unlike the foam products microwaves very well."
Have used these for a while. I like the size. They are impossible to find in the store.
"As whispers fly of another lockdown, I'm doing what I did in early March which was to have a 4 month stock of things I use on a regular basis. Now I'm set with this size of paper bowls."
"I use these bowls for ice cream, trail mix, and to temporarily hold a banana peel after breakfast. They're also a good size for instant oatmeal. Stackable too."
I use these to line the pet wet food bowls and they hold up very well. When I have to travel it is easier for pet sitter to toss out than wash the bowls every day so they are very helpful.
Love Dixie plates and bowls they’re sturdy and great for every day use
We use these bowls at our business. They are sturdy and hold quite a bit of food. Great value for the quantity of plates you get.
Use these to feed my cats with. One bowl lasts several times.
Durable and just the right size for individual servings...
I have several kitties and was tired of washing so many pet dishes so started autoship on these. They save me a lot of time.
These are so so sturdy and durable! That’s why I always buy it in bulk. They come in so handy because they RARELY ever leak! Best paper bowls!
Thought the bowls were bigger but perfect for snacks for the kiddos! Very sturdy and durable! With the kiddos home with this virus lurking it’s great to be able to just throw away after using!
Very sturdy and durable… I bought the wrong size bowls these are very small but they did come in handy so I have no complaints
Served the purpose. I will order again.
use all the time. just right!
Good price for little snack bowls.
I like to keep paper bowls and plastic spoons on hand to make breakfast cleanup quick and easy in the mornings. This is an economical way to purchase the bowls and I like them. They’re a good serving size for oatmeal or cereal for my kids and they’re fairly sturdy.
Love them. These bowls are hard to find sometimes. I use them for our kitty bowls (got tired of cleaning kitty bowls numerous times a day). They work out perfectly. When the cats are finish eating all you do is throw the paper bowls into the trash. Woo Hoo!
"Love these little bowls...I make microwave eggs in them.. I make my microwave Oatmeal in them.. so good for no clean up, LOL and of course, I re-use them...if I've had a portion controlled dry snack out of one in the evening, then I do use it the next a.m. for B-fast. :)"
"Holds up really well with stews, soups, craft projects, etc. really solid product for the price"
Great product for the money.
Durable I only use Dixie you can get them cheaper at Walmart
Only issue was on my end. They are small. Maybe good for a slice of cake. Not for a meal. Make sure to check the measurements. Before buying. Pictures can be deceiving with size. They are otherwise nice and sturdy.
This is the most economical way to buy these bowls if you use them often. The price comes out to be cheaper per bowl than the cheap store brand.
I use them to serve fruit and small amounts of dessert or for a small salad. They are durable.
"Great price for the quantity! Good quality as well, perfect size bowl for soups, snacks, or cereal!"
Perfect size for dips and egg salad. Quick delivery. Great vendor.
"Best paper plates I have found. I host a lot of cookouts and parties, and these wonderful things have saved me untold hours on cleanup."
I love to use these bowls for my morning oatmeal. Also good for ice cream or pudding desserts. They are sturdy and don’t get soggy or leak.
These were bought mainly for two of my furry babies. They take medicine and these little bowls work well for mixing things and then throwing away or for recycling. Convenient to have.
Pretty sturdy. Works well for snacks for my little ones.
Great quality and perfect size.
"Love these little bowls!!! They are the perfect disposables for an ice cream dessert, a small salad, cut up fruit, or leftover veggies. No dishes to wash and no mess. I keep them in our kitchen all the time!!"
I use these Dixie 10oz Every Day Paper Bowls
Durability! Sturdy!
Durable; great value
Good value
Good price. Fast delivery.
i dont use regular plates and bowls i use dixie for everything .. they hold up well after several minute of microwave cooking and i put them in the recycle bin ..no clean up
Product came too late for outting . will use for every day use Disappointed in shipping issues but im sure they will work out quite well
"I orginally purchased these for my oatmeal. However, the bowls are the perfect size for a large can of cat food."
"I have a set of metal bowls in wrought iron frames for feeding the cats. The Dixie bowls fit perfectly inside the metal bowls, allowing easy clean-up. Living in a drought-prone area, water is a valuable resource. Paper usage and disposal are less costly than water."
Price was great received my order very fast
Ease of use. Used for food.
As described. Shipped very well. Plastic wrapped like in the store.
Dixie bowls are great and nice design as well. Sturdy. Great size. I use them everyday.
multiple times.
Sturdy paper bowls perfect for snacks or small deserts.
Love this product
"Great size for desert, very happy"
"I like the bowls as it's good for holding liquid items such as ice cream, yogurt etc. It's also good for limiting the amount of food I can place in the bowl to eat."
Dixie are the only bowls I'll even consider.
These are so cute and the perfect size. I put a lemon in one bowl for reference- definitely a good sized soup/snack bowl and a really nice color for a plastic bowl. I needed to replace some other bowls that were broken and these are a great addition!
I wanted a bowl set for microwaving leftovers and soups. These work very well for that purpose. I don’t know yet how well they will hold up over time since I have only had them a couple of months but I have seen no negatives so far.
Perfect size for cereal or a meal. Doesn’t stain from red sauces. Great in dishwasher and microwave
These are great. Wonderful easy to clean. Dishwasher approve. No issues. Love the colors and the large capacity that they hold. Nice and sturdy in your hand. Definitely would buy again. Thinking about more.
I love these bowls. They are sturdy easy to clean and perfect size. Will purchase more in future.
My kids love them. Easy to clean & the won’t break!!
"This is the perfect cereal bowl for kids. We didn't want to worry about kids dropping/breaking the bowls so we opted for these and they work perfectly. They are sturdy, not that weird cheap plastic. Perfect size/depth. We also ended up using them for side salads. They are convenient and easy to clean."
"I really love these bowls. Super-light, which is important to me, as I have poor grip and drop things. Hopefully these won't break if I do drop them. Held up well in the dishwasher and microwave, so far. Perfect size for cereal, pasta, salad, dnd they wash off well. If these withstand the microwave and dishwasher use in the long term - I'm buying a lot more!"
Nothing to dislike great product have even dropped one or two and no damage....
These are great for the microwave. I no longer burn my hands when removing them. They are easy to clean and are holding up great.
Cheap price works great no scratching metal sound from a kid using it lol
"What a nice change from basic plastic! They are a great size, sturdy and nice colors!"
Love these bowls. This is the second set I have gotten. They are easy to clean even when using pasta sauce.
Caution looks bigger than they really are
A good size bowl.
These are great. We use them every day
It was so hard to find out the dimensions of these cereal bowls. fyi - they are regular cereal bowl sz. Smaller than I had hoped but good otherwise.
Bought them to go with my colorful dishes (in front). Expected all 4 colors. Instead I got 12 washed out orange bowls. Satisfactory for kids cereal but nothing else. Not wasting the time to send them back.
Good bowls but not for spaghetti it will stain
The color adheres to the bowl after use. It doesn't feel very hygienic.
"Perfect size, super durable, microwaveable and dishwasher safe."
"Beautiful bright colours, the bowl are lightweight, microwave and dishwasher safe and hold a decent amount of food, perfect for cereal and pasta too. There were only a couple of odd marks in two of them but barely noticeable. Great value for the price!!!"
"Awesome bowl set. Very durable, so easy to clean. I love the bamboo eco look to them too! Had them for months now and they still are like brand new. The material never stained and kept its shape. Will definitely buy again!"
"I am prone to breaking bowls so these are perfect for me, they are sturdy, easy to clean and a lot more fits inside than I originally thought, plus the colours are nice"
"Sirven perfecto para cereal o incluso sopa, se puede meter al microondas sin problema. No lo recomiendo para palomitas porque considero quedan muy chicos"
"Cumple con lo que dice, no se manchan, muy resistentes"
"Muy buenos y bonitos, sobre todo para los niños."
Nunca llegaron!! Y pedi 2 sets...
"I knew I wanted a wood fruit bowl to use as a centerpiece for my dining table but couldn’t find one at any of the typical stores that you’d expect to find such a thing. I found this one and for around $20 didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger. Thus far, it has held up well. The bowl should be hand washed only; due to the smooth finish, cleaning is an easy task. I would highly recommend this bowl if you’re searching for a nice centerpiece, salad or fruit bowl."
"I was a little skeptical about purchasing this bowl after reading some of the reviews about a hole a few weeks after receiving, or the wood swelling after soaking in water over night. But I was search of a wooden bowl - so I bought it. I purchased in August (I know I’m a little late with this review lol), and as of today IT IS STILL PERFECT! I have a family of 5, so we make quite a large dinner salad and it is absolutely perfect! There are times I use it as a fruit bowl and place it in the middle of the table for the kids to grab and go as they please, and it’s a pleasant addition. NOW! I didn’t soak my bowl overnight, so it may very well swell and open. I wash my bowl immediately after using, towel dry and put it away. To add onto my bowl, I purchased “salad hands”. Search for it and thank me later ;)"
"We eat salad almost every night. In the past, we used serving bowls or mixing bowls. However, I wanted a dedicated bowl that said ""salad."" Finding one is easier said than done. First of all, there are only six of us at most who sit down to dinner every night. Most of the advertised bowls would feed a football team. They also took up a lot of room on the table and interfered with conversation and intimacy. This is exactly the right size. It's very attractive, and it isn't ostentatious.It's substantial, but lightweight, and it doesn't break or chip like serving bowls. I also like the way tomatoes and cucumbers and lettuce and kale mix easily in it. It's also very easy to clean. And did I mention it's very reasonably priced? I recommend it."
"I'm a crafter thus always looking for different says to use everyday items. If you crochet,there are yarn holders with a scroll design to hold yarn. For the price,this bowl gives me ample room for large skein yarn,bowl sturdy enough to stay put and I have the option to design with scroll cut or use as is. I liked the idea so much I think I bought two other bowls just different sizes. The 10-12 inch diameter with the depth sold itself."
"I have been looking for a good fruit bowl for a while now and I’m so happy I found this one. It is beautiful, sturdy, easy to clean and the perfect size to fit all my fruits. Packaging was great also. Love It."
"I purchased this bowl (along with wooden salad servers) for a wedding shower gift. It is a beautiful bowl, and the bride-to-be was delighted with it. It is a great size for serving a few or several people."
"This bowl is so pretty! I love the sleek wood. It's light-weight for its size, which is nice. It holds a LOT of fruit! After washing it out with a damp, soapy cloth, I rubbed some olive oil into it to help keep its pretty shine. This would be a great bowl for fruit, potatoes and yams, or a decoration in the middle of your coffee table."
Great fruit bowl! I use it mostly only for oranges & apples. Love the wood & would buy another one for my bathroom or elsewhere! ♡ totally would reccomend for anyone who is into arcadia or bamboo owo ♡
"I purchased this salad bowl as a gift and was hoping it would be ""gift worthy."" I was not disappointed. It is beautiful and will be a wonderful serving piece to give to our daughter and family for Christmas. The only thing is I wished I had shopped for other prices on Amazon, as I could have saved $5."
I love this beautiful bowl. It is easy to clean and light weight for a large wooden bowl. It is my favorite go to for snacks.
A lot nicer than I expected. Easy to hold (arthritis in my hands) not too heavy. Very easy to hand wash. Beautiful wood.
I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this bowl. It's also beautiful
"Love this bowl had it a few months. If it last a long time its a great item. Really meets my need for salads, mixing vegetables for grilling etc."
Very sturdy and well made. This is a great salad bowl.
"Pretty, absolutely giftable, easy to clean but unfortunately not sturdy enough. Every time I wash dishes I am so scared it falls and breaks"
It's a beautiful salad bowl. I'm glad I bought it. I always wanted a good wood bowl. Now I have it.
"Good high quality solid looking bowl. I have previously purchased some flimsy wooden bowls, but this bowl is not one of them. It is solid and durable. The wood is beautifully blended and presents the bowl as a work of art."
"We do all sorts of salads in this bowl, as well as doubling as countertop fruit bowl"
Very nice salad bowl. Sturdy wood. Great size for a group.
This bowl looks exactly as pictured. Durable also. Love it!
I was very pleased with this bowl. It is well made wooden bowl.
This bowl is a good size and looks nice. I’m happy with it
This bowl is beautiful and seems really well made. I ordered it as a gift for my mom and I think she'll love it!
"Beautiful salad owl, large capacity, elegant and very useful to mix or make a salad when 3 or 4 or more people dining"
"Thick, sturdy, hair the right size for salads."
This is a beautiful wooden bowl great for salads great for holidays it looks beautiful 😉
Beautiful bowl! Nicer than I expected. Just the right size for a family salad! Not to large-not to small. Looks expensive!
"Very nice very large bowl, with a nice set of salad tongs would be a good gift ."
looks great and salads taste better
Great looking product. Just what I was looking for.
What a beautiful bowl! I am very pleased with my purchase and I would recommend this to anyone wanting a wooden bowl for their table.
"Most beautiful bowl, worth every penny."
"Very nice quality bowl. I was reluctant to go with such an expensive bowl, but in this case you get what you pay for."
I am using this as a decoration in a plant holder and it’s the perfect size and cute!
"Awesome bowl! I use it for a personal salad bowl. Note: I eat giant salads! This thing is perfect for me. I keep it in the freezer so it's cold for my salads. No cracks, no problems so far."
Beautiful serving bowl.
I picked this out for work and it turned out to be a great choice. Thanks!
"Excellent quality, price and fast shipping"
Little bigger than I though but it works
"A great sized salad bowl, and it's beautiful."
"Excellent, versatile bowl. Easy to clean and is everything you'd expect."
Love this bowl for salad or chips. Great look and I always get asked where I got it.
Super nice bowl. Very smooth surface. I love it.
It’s beautiful
Very well made and sturdy. Not gigantic but big enough for a dinner for 4.
Loved the look and the way you can hold...lovely salad bow..
Gorgeous and warm bowl that makes any salad look like a masterpiece. Very nice quality!
It's a bowl. 9.5/10
Exactly as described nice bowl
Great
Love it for a salad serving bowl.
Great quality and the perfect size for a nice salad
"Ordered this for my mother , and she loves it!! Great value for the price and easy to clean!"
As advertised
Very nice looking
Slow shipping but looks great
Great wooden fruit bowl.
A beautiful bowl for either a salad or to display fresh fruit. Very well made and looks great in my kitchen.
"This was a gift, so I wasn't able to use it, but when opening the package when it arrived, I found it to be of great quality."
This is the perfect salad bowl - love it - washes perfectly
Great quality! love it! I use it as a fruit bowl.
Beautiful and strong Arrived on time in great condition
Awesome
"Love this bowl. Wish it was a little deeper, but I still like it!"
It’s my favorite fruit/salad bowl. Great for potlucks
same as the headline :)
Beautiful wood bowl. You won't be disappointed!
Small amount of water left in bowl will warp and ruin product. Less than a tablespoon of water was left in ours overnight and we discovered a large hole had formed by morning.
"Just got this bowl today. I was struck about how different the color seemed versus the picture in the listing...in reality it is quite a bit darker. Also, saying it is 12 inches wide is a bit generous...from my measurement, it was slightly more than 11 1/2 from the outside edge (not the inside edge)."
Bought it for nuts during the Christmas season. Did a good job as I bought way too many nuts. Now all I need is a German nutcracker to use. Hope I can use it for salads later..
"I live in a pretty full house and we all eat a lot of noodles/soup/rice dishes and these are the perfect size for your average meal! They can hold those bigger cans of soup with a little leeway (think like Campbell's big chunky or progresso's classics etc), a ramen packet and its broth, all that. Since they're so smooth they're really easy to clean, and they go through the dishwasher without a hitch. I might need to buy another set, they're so popular that just 6 are in and out of the wash almost every day!"
Great bowls for multiple users. These are the perfect size for Ramen noodles! Easy to clean. Light weight and durable. Perfect addition to any set due to plain white color. Great idea as gift for college kids or first time apartment goers!!
Product matched the description given.
QUALITY items at a GREAT price!!
Love my bowls! Easy to clean and very sturdy.
Dinner wear does not make black scratches on the white surface.
Not only are these bowls the perfect size but the price was great as well...
"Had them a few weeks, they are great bowls, for what ever you need."
"Does its job, works well & will last a long time."
I was pleased with the quality of this set of cereal bowls.
"These are great bowls for cereal or soup, but also for serving small salads etc. They are so easy to wash, and I've already had so many opportunities to use them. Very versatile and worthwhile."
"Great quality. Wonderful for soup, chili and even cereal. Love them!"
These bowls are perfect size and super sturdy. Love them.
Love
"Perfect size for soups, cereal, ice cream, etc."
"Awesome, durable dish"
"These are good quality bowls, but not practical if you need a lot of bowls. I couldn't stack these as they are not true and round so to store them would be trouble."
Had two bowls chip within 2 weeks. These are a little delicate.
"They were very well packed, yet 4 of the 6 bowls were chipped and cracked. They seemed to be poorly made."
"All bowls are not the same , some of them are defected (shape not round)"
These are just okay. Some of them are shaped oval so they don’t stack well. One bowl arrived chipped. Not horrible but I am disappointed
"Expensive, poor quality, and get extremely hot when used in microwave or with soup."
Made in CHY-NAH.
Nice bowls for the price.
The label on the bottom comes right off after being in water and/or scrubbing.
"After once through my dishwasher, the dishwasher safe imprint and accompanying information deteriorated and left extremely difficult to remove black specks on everything else in my dishwasher. I would not purchase these bowls because they're clearly not dishwasher safe."
"I really like the classic style of these bowls. I am not sure why but every time I see them it makes me want to make a big bowl of cereal (which is probably not a good thing!)  They are classic white in color, hold a good amount (24 oz) which is a must for me and have a nice glossy shine. Quality wise they look like there much more expensive than there price.  These are also microwave and dishwasher safe which is another must for me.  They were packaged well and mine arrived in perfect shape.  If you like this look and color I don’t think you have to look any further, you have found your next set of bowls"
"This set of six bowls by Kook are great!  They are beautifully finished with no rough underside edges or blemishes. They have a lovely,  glossy finish.  They are generous in size with a capacity of three full cups ( 24 ounces ), which for me, makes them ideal for a hearty bowl of soup or a filling serving of breakfast cereal. They are a great size also for entertaining as they can serve as dip bowls or to serve snacks. I appreciate the elegant simplicity and believe they are a classic design that should work for many tastes. These bowls have a good weight to them and are durable for everyday use. Oh, and they come through use in my microwave and dishwasher looking like new. Kook securely packages them and they arrived in perfect condition. I've posted some photos to give you a closer look and an idea of the cabinet space they require,  which isn't much as they stack up nicely.  Bottom line, I am reaching for these bowls time and time again and love the size, appearance and quality. I hope my experience and the photos help you out a bit with your choice. I highly recommend giving them a second look. Thank you!"
"These are pretty, well sized bowls with a classic design. If you like your dishware to be timeless, or like me if you prefer to change out place mats and table decorations against plain dishes to change up your style, these are the perfect bowls for you. The simple design goes with everything, they can be dressed up or dressed down and look classic or modern. These bowls are a bright white with a nice glossy finish. They feel appropriately heavy and came without any chips or flaws. As advertised, these bowls did perfectly well in the dishwasher. I have ordered plates from this brand as well. If you are ordering more than one style pay attention to the finish as they do several different whites; some are glossy, some are matte. I’m very happy with these glossy bowls and feel certain I will use them well into the future."
"I really like these bowls, they have a good heft to them and feel very polished and nice. They hold a very comfortable amount of food for almost any of my use cases, more than any of the bowls I already have. They keep heat well. The set of 6 for $25 is definitely worth it, I hope these bowls will stand up well to regular use and not chip and crack. They seem to be slightly better constructed than your average bowl, though they have a very minimalist and generic design. After just a month of use, the Kook branding on the bottom of some of the bowls has already washed off, which is fine by me but just something to note. The bowls are in otherwise perfect condition. This bowl is just satisfying and well made, and always feels ""clean"", in a way."
"I love Vietnamese Pho and Japanese Soba soups, but my bowls where so small I had to refill them several times to get a full serving. These are much bigger - not huge - just big enough to serve soup but still small enough to also use for cereal or ice cream. I live in a tiny house and I don't have room for giant Pho bowls so these are the perfect compromise. They're also a good size for a hearty dinner salad.  What I really like about these is the style - they look like Heath stoneware from the 70's - the perfect blend of Mid-Century and beatnik poet cool. I also got Kook dinner plates in grey and salad plates in blue. They really work with the minimal, but stylish vibe I'm trying to create in home."
"I'm really appreciating the Kook series of dishware, having used their plates as well as these 24 oz Ceramic Cereal Bowls now. I love the very minimal and clean look of their designs and finishes, and the ease and convenience of the shapes. These bowls are no exception to the great products this company seems to produce. These are simple bowls, in a perfect size for a serving of soup, cereal, and one entrees leftovers. They are thick enough to hold heat in and feel sturdy, but not so thick that they are clunky or unpleasant. Overall, these are great bowls that work well from fridge to microwave to dishwasher."
"I was not in need of new cereal bowls, but I got these to complete the set as I ordered the matching salad and dinner plates. I am so glad that I ordered these. They are generous in size and I can use them to serve various side dishes. Of course, they can be used for the intended cereal as well. These are well made, smooth, shiny, attractive. They are easy to wash, conveniently able to be stacked. All around a great purchase. I recommend Zook for anyone looking for a simple, clean, elegant and affordable new set of dishes/bowls."
"I’m really pleased with these bowls. They’re sturdy, and have a classic, clean look to them. They’re big enough to hold a good amount of food, but they are NOT 32 oz. The description is misleading, they’re barely 20 oz. Despite the incorrect size listed, I think these bowls look amazing, despite the simple white color. They’ve already gotten a lot of use at our house, and have held up well. Definitely recommend!"
"These have become my family’s nw favorite bowls and plates. When we first got them, I was a little turned off by the weight of them (they are HEAVY and thick) but I like the way they feel- they sit solidly on the the table and seem to retain heat when you place warm food on them, which actually makes eating meals more enjoyable. They feel well-made and sturdy, and have a rustic, yet minimal, look."
"Cereal Bowls, by Kook, Ceramic Make, Holds 24 Oz, perfect for soup, desserts, salads, oatmeal This is the first time I bought kook dinnerware, the set of 6 24oz bowl is the perfect size for rice at night. high quality ceramic make bowl, Microwave and dishwasher safe. The bowls are thick enough to hold hot dishes. I personally feels is not deep enough for cereal or salad."
"I needed just the cereal bowls to add to my dinner ware. I love this size cereal bowls, they are the perfect size for cereal, salad or soup and fit into my cabinets. They are dishwasher safe and the bottom states they are also microwave safe."
"These are nice set of bowls that can be used for many things. They shipped well and when you pick a bowl up, you can find that it's very sturdy. It is microwavable as well as dishwasher friendly. I have just thrown these in dishwasher and it comes out looking like new. We have not had any issues so far and hoping that it survives our kids."
"These bowls would be a perfect gift for someone moving into their first place! They are heavy, sturdy, wash easily and are a classic cereal bowl. They are a bright white with a glossy finish. They remind me of bowls I have from ikea but these are soooooo much nicer than those for a few dollars more. Great bowls!!"
"We bought these bowls because we tend to break a few after a few years with five people in the house. So far, they hold up as well as any other ceramic bowl. We purchased white, although I'd probably choose a different color in retrospect. Solid, budget-friendly set."
"In the winter, we often cook up big hearty soups and stews, but most of our bowls are rather small and we often had to fill them twice or more. These big bowls allow you to get a full meals worth at a time. Good looking, easy to clean. Recommended."
"A simple classic design, these bowls are good-looking, sturdy and versatile. They are perfect for everything from cereal to soup to salad to dips. They stack nicely and match my dishes perfectly. The price is perfect."
"These bowls are a great value for the money. I received six sturdy bowls that are great for cereal, oatmeal, soups, or whatever else I prefer To eat out of them. These are great everyday bowls."
These are beyond gorgeous! Such a crispy white. Perfect quality. Highly durable. My daughter dropped it on the floor and it literally did not break! I love this!
"I like a sturdy bowl that's a good size. These bowls are not too small, and not too big, they are just right. At 32 oz, I plan on using these bowls for salads and fruits, and yogurts."
"These are the perfect size for soup and/or cereal, nice deep bowls for when you want that milk pool for the cereal goin on! Not too big nor too small a great size! Thank you!"
Great set comes with 6 plates. There shiny white and smooth from around. Dishwasher and microwave save. Shipping was fast and came very well pack.
"Nice set of basic bowls. Well-made, versatile, and they stack together nicely and clean easily."
""
"These bowls are deep and hold plenty of food. The clean lines and simple style work well in any dining room. The smooth surface washes up easily by hand or in the dishwasher. Because of the size, these bowls do take up a little extra room in the cupboard compared to other bowls. With the salad and dinner plates, this makes a very nice set of dishes."
Really like the overall smoothness of the bowls. Holds a pretty good amount of food Feel a little heavy but very sturdy. Easy too clean. Dishwasher safe not prone to cracks or chips. Multi purpose uses not just limited to cereal. Can use in the microwave just be cautious as the bowls get hot quickly only negative. Would still recommend.
"These cereal bowls are deep and smaller in diameter, suitable for a more compact table setting, and occupying less cupboard space than our wide, flatter soup bowls. There was a small black speck or imperfection on the inside of one bowl, but otherwise they were clean, glossy, smooth and white, a simple, unpretentious style."
The one set had a broken bowl and they replace it after a month. This bowl is fantastic. Love the wider top - great for noodles - wanted something simple yet sturdy but not super heavy. This is good for everyday use.
"These are great simple bowls, but I thought they would be bigger. They ended up being smaller than expected, they look bigger in pictures than in person. I tried comparing it to the size of a soda can"
Well packaged to avoid breakage during transit. Product is as advertised. Nice size bowls that can be used for serving noodles and pasta as well.
"These bowls are advertised as 32 ounces. According to my measuring cup, they overflow at about 25 ounces (barely 3 cups). Much smaller than expected. IMHO, not worth the price they are charging for small plain white bowls."
I do fine them very sturdy.
I love these. They’re thick and strong. They’re the perfect size. They stack nice too. 10/10 would recommend
"Nothing was chipped or cracked on arrival, nice generous sized everyday bowls for soup or cerial."
"Fast shipping, nice durable bowls! Good size"
Perfect size ad well made.
Como bowls de arroz con salmón y atún
Me gustó su tamaño y resistencia
"Me gustó el tamaño, el diseño, se ven muy bonitos, solamente uno de ellos al primer uso en microondas se cuarteó un poco, es lo único que no me gustó, se supone que los puedes usar sin problema."
Si me gustaron mucho pero de mi pedido llego uno roto de una orilla.
"These bowls get more use than any other bowls in my kitchen. I use them for meal prep, storage, reheating, and even small portion service. The lids fit nice and tight. I've had my set for just over a year. One of the bowls developed a crack about a month ago. So I emailed Oxo and they sent me a replacement bowl from Mississippi at no charge. Excellent customer service!"
"I love these bowls SO much that I later ordered two more sets! These are the perfect size for a bit of leftovers or ingredients diced as part of meal prep. Very sturdy glass (dropped one on the granite!) and nice, light blue, flexible lids. I would not recommend re-heating leftovers with the lid on, since that will likely warp or stain the lid. I use plastic wrap instead (which also creates a “steam-in bag” effect with frozen veggies - when steaming fresh, add a bit of water). I also like to use these bowls to store a bit of leftover fruit, salad, or pudding. My kids seem to gravitate more toward the leftover bits when they are in clear glass bowls such as these!"
"Tired of reusing plastic containers for leftovers and transferring the food to other containers for safe heating, I've bought these glass bowls. Now, they go from fridge to microwave to table to dishwasher (plastic lids on top shelf). I can SEE what's in my refrigerator, and I have way fewer items to hand wash. These lids are sturdy and do not melt or get misshapen in the dishwasher. I love them. I also make a full batch of oatmeal, separate into 4 containers, and voila! I have breakfast for four mornings. Just heat and eat. So easy!"
"I already had 4 of these OXO bowls this Size from another set, wanted more as they are perfect size for several uses, especially large dinners, so I can have several out up and down the table filled with Sour Cream, Salsa, Chef Party Mix etc. Excellent quality!"
These are perfect for those recipes that require a lot of ingredients chopped up ahead of time. I use them when I'm making stir fry or soups or stews or anything with a lot of ingredients. I love having all my ingredients lined up and ready to go in these dishes.
"What’s not to like?! Because they are glass, they don’t take on the smell of the contents. We live near the beach so we get a lot of dust. I took one of these and put it over my Apple HomePod mini to keep the dust out… fits perfectly! 😁"
"Nicer than expected. Smooth, attractively shaped bowls. Can be used for dessert. Lids fit snugly, a bit stiff but seem sturdy."
I bought this for a gift for my daughter to help with her food prep. She uses them all the time. I may need to get some for myself! Food prep ahead of time would save me lots of time at the dinner hour. The lids are great to keep the food fresh and odor out of the fridge.
I had bought some cheaper small bowls with lids before and none of the lids fit right. These are perfect! The lids seal well and honestly the size is perfect. They feel very high quality. I definitely recommend these over the cheaper options.
"Great for mixing scrambled eggs, overnight oats or storing homemade dressings and any small leftovers. The bowl shape is flattering and I like that I don't have to waste plastic wrap to store my food, the lids fit great! Very sturdy, and glass is a solid thickness."
I was looking for small glass bowls to use for feeding my cats their wet food meal & they are the perfect size & shape for them to eat from. Any leftovers can go into 1 bowl & cover with the handy lid for keeping until the next day. I like them so much I may order more for myself.
"Exact size I was looking for, to do small portioning side meal preps. I like to make small Salads, Soups, and even take my morning cereal in, as I'm always on the go. I also bring the mini glass bottles with lids of milk, that I also purchased here on Amazon. THE LIDS MATCH THE LIDS OF THESE BOWLS....LOVE!!!"
We use these for prep bowls when preparing a recipe and for food prep days storing portioned out berries and other food items for ease during breakfast when we don't have a lot of time.
"Just as advertised. Perfect from prep to table. Lots of ways to use these little bowls, covers fit good. Heavy glass yet pretty for your table. Their awesome!"
I love these! Perfect size. Great for storage. I can thtow out all the little mis matched items in cabinet that dont stack nicely! Good value!
"These are the small size I was looking for, and I loved that they included a lid, and came as a multiple set. I would buy again."
"Great prep bowls. A little expensive, but I bought a second set."
Grit Bar. I put all the fixings in the bowls
I love prep work and this makes it so easy to separate all the veggies and sauces!
These are great for all kind of servings and the lids are good
Use these for kid's bowls and they wok great and seem sturdy to falling off the table. Anything not finished can be put in the fridge with a lid for later.
I especially like how well the kids come through the dishwasher!
I really like these cups with lids. A little bigger than I wanted and had intended to return them but am glad I kept them. Use them a lot.
great for cooking preps and storing small leftovers in the fridge like half a lemon
These are just the thing you need if you want to feel fancy! I love that they have lids for storing leftover toppings as well.
"Great size - like perfect for little kids breakfast. But hard to get the lids on and off, but I still love these."
"Great quality, we use these glass bowls on a daily basis for so many things. Very good for storage and holding prepped ingredients for cooking. Super easy to clean !"
Bowls work great for food prep and works great for small meals for those watching calories.
Use these every day cooking. Lids are great for the extra cut up veggies or lemons/limes. Very durable and dishwasher safe.
I love em. Great size and well made.
These are perfect and I shared 2 with my Mother and she loved them!
"They look nice, the lids are so convenient, and they’re perfect for little dishes and prepping food. I went ahead and ordered another set!"
Nstackable. Durable
Very good!
I found it very good for preparing and storing food. It's very well made and worth it!
Great prep bowls
"Use them much more than expected. Good for everything, especially in one person household."
"This was a gift so cannot report on durability, otherwise very satisfied."
Kids work great!
Needed prep bowls and these are excellent.
Perfect size for storing leftovers or using for dips. Lid fits perfectly to seal and keep fresh until next use.
I really enjoy using this for my lunch or snacks for work.
Nice little bowls for prep work or sauces or small amount of leftovers. Thick glass and the lids fit snugly. Would buy again.
"Super great, durable, easy to clean and store"
Need 10 oz bowls with lids for jello. Work great.
Definitely will buy again
These prep bowls are made of glass. The lids fit tight. They nest well in the cupboard and they are dishwasher safe- including the lids.
"awesome little containers. I use them to prep my onions, cilantro, tomatoes ect when doing taco night. The lid is a tight fit and super durable"
"Perfect size for sides, desserts or storing."
"These blows have made my salad prep, much easier and faster."
"I love them, only that unfortunately one cover got burnt in the microwave wave. I would purchase again"
"Nice, sturdy, and transparent glass."
Great buy !!!
Small and convenient. Great for snacks.
"The bowls themselves are perfect for prep. I can fit a whole medium onion diced in a bowl for sizing. I knocked off two stars for the lids! They hold a lot of odors. They are so bad that the cabinets I have the lids in started to smell. I have soaked them in vinegar and baking soda, bleach, laid them in the sun - I can still smell onion, shallot, and garlic making them useless for anything else."
"These bowls are a very nice size-- 4 3/4 inches across and 2 inches deep. The lids are not easy to put on or remove as the lips on the lids are small and stiff. You need to grasp the bowls firmly when putting on or removing them, to avoid spillage."
I love these little bowls. It is so nice to put a small left over in the fridge and know that it will be fresh when I want to use it.
"I love these bowls. I have purchased them before, and like them enough that I ordered more. But this time mine arrived broken. So I’ve taken a star off for durability."
Getting the lid off can be a little challenging. Otherwise nice product.
"Three out of four have chipped in less than a year. Maybe I am too hard on them, but I haven't had the same issues with my glass pyrex bowls."
Larger than my custard cups I was replacing. Lids are a very tight seal.
"Very small, not what I would consider a prep bowl. I was expecting something larger."
"You only sent 4 bowls, not the 8 I paid for. Please send the other 4 or I will return these."
ok for the cost
bowl is teeny-tiny
These are good containers but the lids are very hard to put on.
Not what I expected very small
They wasn’t big ones like I thought they would be
Too small
Love these little bowls so far! They are great for overnight oats. The lids do seem a little flimsy so I’m hoping they hold up through the dishwasher and daily use. Definitely recommend!
I love Dixie brands!! Its been a few years now since I switched over to using paper products i dont have to wash dishes constantly. Dixie takes this off my hands and love the brand because it not cheap. It dont break easily and I can put it in the microwave and I dont have to worry about it melting.
reading is fundamental i ordered these thinking it was the 20 oz bowls silly me. They make great toddler bowls.
"These are durable, don’t leak, and showed me the value of reading the title…. I didn’t realize they were desert bowls :/ So I’ve had some small sized meals, but these hold up well! (the seller has it listed properly. I’m just an eager beaver)"
"I'm using these for oatmeal made in the microwave while I unpack my belongings at my new apartment. They're sturdy, but quite small, which is great if you want small bowls."
Just as expected. They aren’t the most sturdy paper bowls and they are a bit small but they are perfect for every day use for things you don’t want to dirty a dish for. I wouldn’t use them for guests or parties.
I may never use china again. And the price is more than worth it.
Great for helping with portion control.
Since being home from work; washing dishes is off of my list of chores. Paper and plastic all the way! We use these plates for heavy meals like ribs and brisket and for a slice of cake!
I am never leaving home! I have shopped around so many stores trying to coordinate my paper ware! Next item...matching coffee cups!
Very sturdy and large dinner sized.
Good durable plated
Like these. Save on dishes.
"Small size is the key as well as quality and ""stiffness"". I later discovered that it is available locally at the Publix. Kroger doesn't stock this size, and believe me the staff could not care less."
Good for light snacks and meals.
Feed the cats
This won't kill you if you microwave with it.
We use these all the time. No need to wash dishes

Like
Like to use these to warm stuff in microwave.
"Bowls were used for cut fruit and oatmeal at a breakfast buffet, worked out fine"
"Sturdy, very useful for not having to wash up when you're in a hurry. I use these for my little feral cat colony to avoid having to wash the the dirty bowls. They do an amazing job. I just fill 'em up and stick them out into the metal pots I would otherwise be forever washing up.  These are my preferred ones as they fit very well into most pet bowls."
Great plate
smaller than I thought
"I use these paper bowls eating cereal, giving milk to my cat, and other stuff. Very useful. But you do have to be careful of it leaking after some time."
A little pricey but great product
"The product description is misleading, calling them lunch bowls is a joke. These are tiny. You certainly can't fit a can of soup in one."
Are not as strong as I had anticipated
Much smaller than I expected
Smaller than expected
"Granted, the measurements are provided but I don't have a good sense of size. Because the price was $8 for the package, I incorrectly assumed that they were the regular sized bowls. My local Vons sells these for $2.25, Ralph's $2.75, and even Gelson's sells for $3.50. Listing at this price point is intentionally misleading."
Does not hold much at all.....not a good deal compared to local store
"not having read the description, I mistakenly took the TITLE at its word. It says its a Plate in the Name. Why did they mislead us calling it a ""lunch plate"" :/"
ONE set of bowls for this price… 36 bowls total is a ripoff. Don’t buy!!
The bowls look great and as promised. The kids look forward to filling them with ice cream sundaes!
Very useful
"I use these for my cereal, snacks, fruits and anything else I can put in them and you don’t have to wash dishes constantly. I love these ."
This plate is great and don’t get any issue but available at lesser price on wholesale and supermarkets
"I love these bowls. They are great for pasta or for big salads - really any main dish they benefits from a bowl rather than a plate. We use then for take out Thai and Chinese as well. They replaced some Pottery Barn bowls I had for several years and I like these much better. They are a nice size, easier fitting in the cupboard but bigger than a normal bowl for when you need a bowl to act as your main plate. I am considering another set."
"I absolutely love these beautiful bowls! They are nice and sturdy, very durable, and easy to clean. I also find that they have many uses from soup or salad to snacks or tacos, etc. It seems that we’re using them all the time! Would definitely recommend. ps; they also were delivered very well packaged to eliminate breakage."
This pottery goes beyond my expectations. I love setting the table as well as having guests enjoy eating off these pieces of art. Just beautiful.
"Going on a plant-based whole food diet, we needed bowls that were larger than our soup bowls. These are perfect.  Perfect for cooking oatmeal in the microwave because a serving does not overflow the top when cooking."
"These are wonderful bowls to use for a variety of reasons, soups, pasta and cereal. Love the fun bright colors. Delivery was great, well packaged. Happy with the product. They clean up very well and dishwasher safe too."
"These bowls are so lovely, bold blue and ivory with a modern design. My family is hard on dishes and these hold up just fine. I am very happy with this purchase and will probably buy more."
"There's nothing to dislike about these bowls: Good as serving bowls but also perfect for individual portions of pasta, soup or stews. I especially like that they have attractive designs on both inside AND outside surfaces."
"These came very well packed and they are beautiful! I am so excited to get these and I'm having salad for dinner tonight, so yahoo, I'll be using one! 😁"
I put 2 each of the pasta bowls in 2 different Italian gift baskets that I made up. They were a beautiful addition to all the wonderful foods I put in the baskets. The recipients were thrilled to get them !
I love these bowls. They are bigger for pasta or a good soup and heavy which I like. I love the mixed matched patterns.
These are great! We use them for pasta and really lots of stuff. Love to cook Indian and Thai so these are better than a plate!
"Beautiful, and well made. So pretty too! Purchased the all blue bowls and that was more appealing to me."
The design on these is quite attractive for a stencil. Be forewarned that the bowls are quite heavy.
Perfectly sized for pasta. I only wish there were 2 more per set as all other sets have 6 items.
I bought these bowls as a birthday gift for my best friend. He really likes them!
I'm a sucker for blue and white and these bowls don't disappoint. They arrived nicely packed with no chips or broken pieces.
"I have tried several different styles. This brand is the best. Love the style, very durable. Stands up to everyday use. Would recommend"
Perfect for pasta
Perfect size for Chinese delivery meals with the family.
Beautiful pasta bowls are easy to clean and seem durable. I like that each one has a different design on the inside and outside.
I love how vibrant and fun they are. They are great quality and look like it. Perfect size for what I was looking for. I bought them for noodle dishes because I like eating noodles in a bowl like this. The packaging was well thought out and nothing was chipped or broken. Love these gorgeous bowls!
Love these bowls. Not only beautiful but also functional. I eat a lot of salads for meals. These a great for my big salads! Im sure they would also be good serving bowls or pasta bowls.
Beautiful colors.
Great serving bowls
"Great size for a large salad, chili, pasta, etc. Cute designs. A little heavy in the hand. Overall, very happy with these!"
I am one of the people that only eat from a bowl at home. I was in need of a set that matched and the right size. I found these and I love them. Great colors and patterns and not fragile.
"Beautiful! So much better than expected, perfect size. I have ordered a few bowls & returned them in the past, because they did not match the description. I was skeptical, but these are better than I thought they would be. Love them!"
Definitely slippery when wet but strong enough handle the clumsy drop to a wooden floor of over 3 feet height. Totally in love with these bowls.
Happy with them!
Love love love them!
Amazing
We love them.
"I use it for morning hot or cold cereal with apples, sprouted sunflower seeds and nondairy beverages"
These fun colored bowls add so much to our dinner time. It makes me feel like I’m at a restaurant!
Just the size I expected
I love these balls and I’ve ordered another set! They’re beautiful with gorgeous color patterns inside and out. They are on display in my glass cabinet!
These are just perfect! The colors are fab and all different on the outside and inside. They are a great size for pasta dishes and salad.
These are perfect. Very nice bowls.
Very happy with this purchase!!!
"I love these bowls so much, absolutely beautiful."
Get tons of compliments
Love the size. Great for so many things. And beautiful colorful patterns.
I first ordered the wrong size but returning was a breeze and the correct size received after was perfect. Very pleased with my purchase.
Perfect size for dinner! Gorgeous and vibrant blues. Very sturdy. Loved them so much I bought a second set 💗
"Very high quality, heavy, and well made."
Beautiful
Dishes are exactly what we wanted. Sturdy yet fun!
"Beautiful, great size, though a bit heavy."
"Beautiful, finish is excellent!"
Absolutely love ❤️
"I’m obsessed with these bowls! They’re fantastic for salads, pasta, and honestly they’re just perfect for everything. I replaced my entire dishes along with purchasing extra bowls for the above mentioned and I find myself using these more than the awesome new set of dishes I purchased. My husband likes them so much he wanted me to order more so we’d have 12 to match the amount of our other dishes. He loves them!"
"The colors are great! They are very sturdy and make for great serving dishes or fruit bowls. I like that they are versatile, go in the dishwasher. We use them almost every day!"
"These are beautiful!! had to place another order as I thought there were 6 pieces, however only 4. I did not fully read the description. Can't comment on durability etc. yet as I just received."
"Love these bowls. They are large and perfect for salad and big items like taco salad or pasta. I love the colors. They are heavy, which I like. Quality item. Will buy again!"
These are a perfect size and are beautiful. They are a great fit for the rest of out dishes.
"Bought a set for serving bowls to liven up my all white dinnerware. Ended up using them for soups, pasta, salads. Just bought another two sets to give as gifts."
"Nice large bowls for pasta dishes and stews. Attractive, easy to clean. Weight is on the heavier side."
"I absolutely love these bowls! They are colorful, sturdy, and easy to clean. They are great for soups, stews, pasta, stir fry.... really most anything. I highly recommend!"
They arebeautifil
"Dress up your meals and snacks with these unique, colorful bowls. Brighten up your table at mealtime. Very generous size for main dishes, salads, desserts, etc."
Beautiful colors and good quality little heavy
Perfect for salads and pastas!! The colors and designs are beautiful!
Definitely grate for salads and my oatmeal/ waffle concoctions and more! Great purchase
"Love these bowls, size is great for everything, bright beautiful blues, but maybe just a little too heavy for me. On other hand, the heft helps keep food warm."
"Great bowls and they're bright and colorful, too!"
Love these bowls and are perfect for pasta dishes and dinners with sauces/gravy/broth.
"Well made, absolutely beautiful!"
Serving food
These are durable and almost exactly what I was looking for. I gave these 4 stars because some of the designs are pixelated on the outside which cheapens the look. I'll get a lot of use out of these though and I like the deep blue.
Like the bowls but they are heavy.
My son absolutely loves this bowl! Before this we used mostly suctions bowls to prevent him from tossing them but I decided to give this one a try and honestly he only threw it once and it was empty! Something about this bowl he just loves and now he won’t eat out of any other one so I decided to order a plate as well. Mommy loves it because it is silicone and very well made! Another great product from oxo!
"No suction on this bowl at all but it is weighted. Very easy to clean and durable and does not retain scents or stains.i bought two and am very happy with this for snacks or single portion baby foods. I also have sectioned one And the combination of the three are great! The only negative is that these bowls do not have any suction on the bottom so you have to hold it away from baby’s but in my opinion that’s not really a big deal, because that is what I do anyway to keep little hands out of the food. I also think this will transition nicely into the toddler years as a snack bowl for crackers, grapes, etc. this was one of the reasons I chose this! Overall, I would highly recommend these bowls.  *If you feel my review was helpful, please click the helpful button below. Thank you!"
"I'm slightly embarrassed to say I use these for the cats. I have a large dog who would love to eat the cat food, and so I feed the cats on the kitchen window sill. The problem was, I could never find a dish that would STAY on the window sill.  These dishes stay where you put them, are super easy to wash, and are cute besides. Someday, I may have human grandchildren, and I will be certain to buy more!"
I was pleasantly surprised by how much I really like this bowl for my daughter. It’s heavy but not too heavy that she cannot lift it up on her own. I would definitely recommend the bowl.
"My 13 month old is very aggressive, but this worked better than the suction bowls I’ve used. It worked perfectly with these Choomee flexi spoons, as they allowed him to really scrape the bottom of the bowl with the flexible spoon without moving around at all. It’s well weighted and high quality. I’m so excited to see my son finish his entire bowl of oatmeal on the first try with this bowl and spoon combo, which he could never do before with a variety of other spoons and bowls that I’ve used."
I actually bought this for use as a dog dish. My little one did not like her tags hitting the ceramic bowl. This seems to have solved the issue. It goes right into the dishwasher. Quite happy with this purchase.
This plate is very heavy duty and my kid hasn’t figured out how to pick up yet and I hope he doesn’t. I like the sturdiness of this plate. I also love the teal color one of the many reasons I bought it. I also like the 3 compartments to separate different foods and add variety.
"I love this bowl. It has weight to it so my 18 month old doesn't accidentally knock it off the table. The curve helps her spoon the food out easily, it also helps prevent the food from spilling when she tips the dish. Easy to clean. It doesn't suction to the table, but the weight helps in that area. It's the only dish she doesn't try to throw."
I need these I'm adult sizes! These are awesome. I love that they are weighted but don't suction. Dishwasher safe. Keeps food from rolling off my toddler plate.
This weighted silicone bowl is great for cereal. Raised edges good for scooping. Dark blue color hides stains. Easy to clean. My 2yo loves it and so do I. Highly recommend!
"We love these. Oxo tot is my favorite brand dog anything for the little tike. These bowls are great, we like the plates even better."
Works well
"Easy to clean, weighted so stays in place, the turned in top makes getting food in the spoon easier. We love this bowl!"
"this bowl is so smooth and sturdy, weighty. I LOVE is for putting my massage cream in for each client. basically impossible to knock over!"
Works great as a dog bowl
Beautifully made deep bowel. I'll be ordering again
"Oh my gosh I love this! It’s a much darker blue than the picture but that makes it look even so much better, exceeded my expectations. It’s also a little on the heavier side which makes it difficult for baby/ toddler to knock off the high chair or out of you hands."
Good
"This bowl does not do well in the dishwasher. Soap residue clings to the bowl so much that every time i wash it in the dishwasher, I have to rinse it under hot water and rub my hand on the inside of the bowl so that my son doesn't end up eating soap. The scent of the soap lingers though, so the bowl still smells soapy even if it's full of food. The weight is good, and the rim is good for dragging spoons backwards to prevent drips. The amount the bowl holds has been good for my son for the last 4 months (he is now almost 14 months, and has a big appetite.)"
I bought these for my chihuahua who hits his poor teeth on the edges of hard bowls and plates. He wouldn't eat without being hand fed before these silicon dishes!
The product is great.
"I ordered this bowl for my cats water bowl and then two of this brands plates for their food. I am so glad that I found these. The price point, durability and ease of food cleanup has me recommending these products to any pet parent. We have a cat that likes to try and burry her uneaten food to save for later and these bowls never tip over. We no longer have to have extra bowls so that used bowls can soak for a while before cleaning dried can food. These cleanup so easily. I cannot say enough great things about these bowls. It’s almost like they were made for pets more than kids!"
"We’re a big OXO household, and as a toddler parent, I was really excited about these. They are durable, nice to look at, they work great and he doesn’t sling them around the table. But while he doesn't seem to mind (or know better), these definitely tend to retain a soapy taste/scent that transfers to anything you serve in them - even after extensive washing in hot water. After switching to an unscented gel clean dish detergent (which felt quite an extreme household move for just 3 dishes), it seems a bit better, but I would say this is a major material flaw because this renders them impossible to hand wash on the fly with normal dish soap. Hoping for an improvement from OXO because aside from the soap flavor, this is my favorite line of baby dish wear yet!"
"Great silicone bowl for kids. It has a nice weight as described so it is not easily knocked over. These do not have a suction bottom, but the finish of the silicone on the bottom of the bowl is such that it will not easily slide. It was quite difficult to push when it sat on my tablecloth that has a thin shiny plastic surface."
Very durable for babies
"I wanted a bowl that was kid friendly (won’t break) but had weight to it so that they can have as much of a realistic feeling to a regular adult bowl for my toddler who is training to transition to the real thing. I used to want the suction at the bottom when she was a year or year and a half when she was blantantly throwing her bowl (as was normal behavior). Now that she’s two, she doesn’t throw her bowl but needs to pick it up and slurp the last of her soup or shovel the last bit of rice (like adults do), so I needed a bowl that was weighty, not glass, nor plastic, and had no suction at the bottom. This was perfect. The rounded tip helps her scoop her food against the rim, so she gets less frustrated too! The bottom also has a little resistance so she doesn’t knock it over easily if she brushes it by accident when she reaches for her water cup. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
"Absolutely love this! Just a heads up though, this is not a suction bowl. But it does not budge when my toddler digs around with her fork and spoon trying to eat. It holds a ton of food, definitely plenty for a small kid. But it is still a relatively small size. I can see this lasting a very long time. Considering getting more to add to the cupboard, in which case a downside would be that they are not stackable so take up lots of room with more than one. But if you’re not looking for suction specifically then I definitely recommend this. The sides are curved in slightly which makes it harder for a toddler to accidentally scoop all of their food out onto the table."
"I found this on sale and honestly hit the jackpot. I love the way it is shaped so it's easy to scoop out of and not make a mess. The bottom allows you to put it on the high chair or another surface without being able to slip or be pulled around, like a suction cup but not as strong. It is extremely easy to clean even if you don't immediately rinse it out. It also is very easy to get almost every last bite of baby food out of it. I love this bowl as well as the matching spoons."
"We've used this a few times and so far it's awesome. My 22mo needed a heavier option because she throws everything on the ground. While she can pick this up, it feel less likely. I also love that she's able to feed herself cereal. That's way easier than using our ezpz mat plate because this is deeper and more bowl-like. My 4yr wants one too, so probably do that as well. And now I'm also considering the plate because we just need heavier options since suction doesn't work for us."
I bought this to use a feeding dish for one of my cats. He has some issues with eating and will sometimes bite the edge of any feeding bowl hard while trying to get the food into his mouth. I replaced his metal bowl with this one to protect his teeth. It is heavy enough that it doesn't slide around while he is using it. I actually came back and bought 3 more of these same bowls to replace all of my cats dishes. It is really easy to clean and seems very durable.
I bought this for my now 11 month old a few weeks ago. It's perfect. It doesn't suction but it's heavy enough and she wasn't new to having her food in a plate or bowl and I think this bowl is great for a LO who has already had some exposure. I use it for snacks sometimes but I can also fit her whole lunch or dinner in there sometimes too. Perfect size for little hands. We don't have an automatic dishwasher so my favorite thing is that it's SUPER EASY to clean!
"Love this bowl! My toddler hates the suction bowls and plates and peels it off immediately. With this bowl, she eats out of it willingly. Not sure why, maybe because she feels like it’s a real bowl. I like the weight of it, it makes her scoop yogurt, rice, pasta out of it really easily. I’m going to buy more."
"We have a toddler who was having a hard time eating by himself, this bowl has made it very easy for him to eat cereal and pasta with the sturdy design and high edges. This works even better than those more lightweight bowls with suction. No issues with it moving or being pushed or tipped over, we bought the spoons and plate as well and love all of the pieces!"
Great bowl for small kids or a pet. Very easy to keep clean and very stable which helps avoid making a mess. Some dogs may find the silicon makes a good chew toy so keep that in mind if you are considering this for a pet.
"Using for baby led weaning. Good depth ~1 inch. Decent weight, doesn't suction, but doesn't matter. Between weight and silicone, 6 month old can't move."
Very nice bowl heavy but I thought the bowl was supposed to suction but it doesn’t at all. Overall a great bowl but baby can pick up and throw or push off their table very easily.
This bowl is just what I was looking for. It is somewhat weighted so our grandson will be less likely to push it around trying to get food on his spoon. It's very sturdy/durable and should last for several grandkids.
"Soap residue gets stuck so easily in this bowl, especially if washed in the dishwasher. Disappointing because we love all other oxo tot products!"
I have a nervous rescue dog. And this bowl is great for him. its soft and it doesn't make noise when the kibble moves around in the bowl. It also doesn't move around the floor when he eats out of it.
"Me encanto el color, es grueso , por lo tanto resistente y durable , fácil de limpiar! Lo recomiendo 👍🏻🤩"
I thought it was suction but it’s not. Still is good and small enough for my daughter to hold and carry on her own. It does have a heavy base though.
"Cute, baby likes it. Doesn’t necessarily stay on the high chair tray but we’re teaching him that sometimes you can eat from a dish!"
"Perfect size, no soap or food smell, my son loves it!"
A very sturdy bowl. Easy for the little fingers to grip. Not easy to be flipped over. Very happy parents
This thing is awesome! It is actually very heavy so keep that in mind but I really liked that bc my infant couldn't pick it up and throw it. It's very well made and I would probably buy a few more of these!
"Such a disappointment. I’m not sure what baby thinks this is “too heavy to lift”. It’s not heavy, and it Is not being used anymore. It makes more of a mess than it’s worth."
Heavy and good quality but totally not what I was expecting. I thought I was ordering a bowl with suction. Oh well.
These are great for having a little one learning how to eat because as they grab their food they also grab the plate sometimes and I think it’s a game dropping it on the ground you can’t go wrong with this one
Not sure why this asked about suction power... not supposed to suction. But a nice well sized silicone bowl for the babe
"It’s a little small for what I’d consider ideal, but overall it’s great."
"We loved it, its big enough for my babtmy, easy to clean, no suction but it does not slip easily."
"Works great for the baby, but I bought one for myself to help get reclaim from my dab rig and it is just perfect for it! Just use hot water and it'll grab whatever reclaim you have for a nice hit (or 3)."
"This is a really nice bowl durable and sticks where it is placed. I wish they made a bigger version of this. (I wanted to use it as a food bowl below our cat feeder, but it's too small for that, haha)"
Received a returned and previously opened item. Marked as new but definitely was not.
Love it! Wish I knew about these before I had purchased these other bowls I have which are not silicone.
Loved it very easy to clean excellent price wonderful product and color is my favorite!!! Heavy plate for child to pick up which is a plus!
Baby is able to pick it up and move it around her tray but it’s too heavy for her to flip over. So easy to clean too
Perfect bowl for BLW!
"The review asked for suction power? Not sure what the suction would be, but it's a great bowl. I actually use it to heat up beauty wax, and it works great. Easy to clean and is difficult to tip over."
"Came used. Apparently it was previously washed, I could see the dry water drops. The bag wasn’t sealed."
I absolutely love this bowl! It is the perfect size even for my older toddler. Love oxo products!
Adore this stuff! This bowl is so nice and heavy enough. Colors are great. Definitely well made!
Very nice material and color. Nice weight to it too just wish it has suction power. My baby girl was easily pick the bowl up. So i save this bowl for when she is a bit older.
Perfecto 👌
"After unpacking, found a tiny shallow hole inside the bowl. Otherwise I would have been very satisfied with this purchase."
"The OXO Tot Silicone Bowl is amazing! We have hardwood floors and our son has been flinging his dish ware and feeding the dog. The dog is getting fat, my floors were getting dented, but the baby has been having a blast. This bowl is not only easy to clean, it's just heavy enough that it slows him down from throwing it and when he does throw it, it's gentle on my hardwoods. The colors are bright and vibrant, food comes right off and I love that it's silicone and not plastic."
"I've been using this bowl for my 3 year old son for the last days and here are my thoughts:  This bowl is heavy duty, not easily scratched and deep in color. My son has liked using it and it is very spill resistant. Considering how high the walls are it is ideal for children. However it is a little ""too deep"" for certain foods which creates a mission for my son to clean his bowl. It becomes easy to waste anything with sauces in this bowl just due to the rim. The bowl is really on the heavy side considering the size of the bowl itself; this is because its solid silicone. Time will tell how this bowl holds up in the dishwasher and with various other foods but for now I am happy with it. The color of the bowl is attractive and it keeps my son from spilling things all over his placemat.  If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!"
"This a solid and heavy bowl. The more I use this bowl, the more I'm loving it. They make it so it’s heavy and the bottom has a shiny film that sticks to the high chair tray or granite counter creating that bond where you cannot push this bowl. If you lift the bowl it comes right up and can be tossed by your toddler, but so far it's the only bowl she hasn't been interested in tossing or lifting probably because it heavier. The only downsize is they are kind of bulky storing these especially if you buy all the pieces like I did. It washes well, can go in the dishwasher, and microwave. Amazing!"
"This is a great bowl for kiddos who are just learning to feed themselves and still enjoy throwing their food, plates, and utensils. It’s also versatile for serving almost any kind of food. I love the fact that it can go in the microwave and stored in the fridge. It’s also dishwasher-safe, but I hand wash my kids’ eating utensils. The weighted bottom is a really unique solution to keeping it from ending up on the floor instead of in your child’s mouth. It’s easier to use than the suction style dishes. You don’t have to worry about anything spilling when setting it down or picking it up. The edges make it easy for kids to keep food on their spoons. I’m a big fan of Oxo Tot, and this weighted bowl hasn’t disappointed me."
"This bowl is great. It has just the right amount of weight not to get tipped and obviously won’t break if dropped. It’s so adorable too, baby Noah calls it his ‘doggie bowl’! I have the matching spoon, and I gotta say it’s his favorite bowl to eat from, no kiddie designs needed. I like that it’s a solid color, it can be used for many years to come! No odor, dishwasher and microwave safe too. It’s perfect!"
"I’m a steady customer for these paper bowls. When making a quick instant oatmeal breakfast, these bowls are the perfect size for two packets. They hold up well when boiling water is applied to the cereal flakes. They are perfect for me!"
I was very thankful for another reviewer that said she uses these for her feral cat. I have 2 that now sleep on my porch every night. I was really happy to hear these bowls held up to moisture. And they do ! Happy me .. happy cats.! Oh .. they’re great for people as well.
"Great bowls for the person or family that loves the use a lot of bowls but hates to clean dishes everyday (even if you use a dishwasher in-between). A single bowl is a bit thin on its own. I recommend doubling up on the bowls when you use them for more sturdy approach with these bowls. We use them for RV camping trips as well. No muss, no fuss, with cleaning dishes."
Great product great price fast shipping Good quality
"As expected, good quality and price. Repeat purchase and will continue to be!"
These are primarily for cereal and soups but need a sturdy plate under for soup or things heated in microwave or you may spill.
Been using this product for years
"We love the Dixie line of products because you know if they say it is heavy weight, that it will absolutely stand up to heavy food. Even though it is the smaller size bowl, it still fits a good amount of food. And they work great for liquids and high moisture items like having a bowl of cereal with milk or ice cream. But we also use them at our BBQs for heavy and hot items like chili and have no issues."
Love these bowls. They are super sturdy and work great. Highly recommend.
Great
"Kitty food bowl liners (20 ounce size). I use cereal bowls for cat food, as find the tiny pet bowls fairly useless for grown cats - they get pushed around, and slopped over.  But the kitties walk away from their food and come back, so of course it gets all gummy. Using these as food bowl liners keeps everything fresh and u are not scraping crust off the dishes all the time. Of course I grab them too for my own snacks. I used to get bowls at grocery and would get twitchy when I ran out, and get real irritated when all that was available was plastic bowls. These are just a great all around product and bulk buying is so convenient; plus even the pattern is soothing and attractive. Not sure the cats care but they might."
Very sturdy and leak proof.
Been using these for years
I like the size and may try to find bigger bowls
Perfectly perfect!!
"love everything about these paper dishes. sturdy, durable, fabulous. thank you"
Reasonable quality
Heavy duty!
Buying in bulk is perfect for bowls
Great
I use these bowls to feed a colony of feral cats. They are sturdy and leak proof. Work well for outdoors.
Needed more of these and was a good value
Love these bowls We have 5kids in addition to ourselves company and just different uses They use them for cereal We warm up dip and they can hold hot soup as well We love these bowls and will continue to get them
"I use these to feed wet cat food to my cats. These are terrific. No leakage, strong enough to survive the kittens using them as frisbees when the food is gone. Will buy these again. :)"
just like picture
Will always buy
As described by listing.
We swear by them
Will not waste money on other name brand products which are so inferior to Dixie products. Dixie products are always dependable.
This is exactly what I wanted for the reasons I checked above.
They were very satisfactory.
Every thing was a ok.
Use these for pet feeding. Good quality. Good price. Very satisfied.
Strong solid bowls and just the right size for my spoiled kitty's food. I will be placing my third order for this product. Excellent product.
"I use these bowls both for the microwave and for my dog's food. They're very heavy, very sturdy, for both uses. I've been buying them for years now and will continue to do so."
These bowls are sturdy enough for a hot chili or cold cereal. I use these on a daily basis. Easy to wipe clean and toss into the recycling bin.
Very good! Fast Delivery and good quality!
"Throw away, great size"
Didnt receive degreaser. Only received dixie plates.
Not bad. Works for parties
Great product for the price
"Very good, very convenient to use"
GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT!!!
Great next time the larger ones.
Great bowls. WE use them all the time so no dish washing. Also good to use outside.
"I have been using Dixie bowls for years to feed my 6 cats. They are strong, sturdy and do not bleed through to the bottom. We also use them for cereal bowls. I have no dishwasher so I don’t feel like washing 12 cat dishes a day, leaving me more time to give some loving to my pussycats. I’m also able to rinse these bowls out and dispose of them in my recycling container."
"The red dinner plate is about 10.6 inches. As you can see, these are very small bowls. I was disappointed when I saw them."
"BEWARE! These bowls are quite small. The description as 12 oz bowls misled me. They are essentially useless.  And BEWARE! They are non-returnable. I missed that when buying the item, but in my defense, who would expect an Amazon product to not be returnable."
"These bowls are SO TINY! I mean, you can't eat soup or cereal or any normal amount of food in these. This is big enough to feed a toddler mac n cheese, THAT is how SMALL these are! From the description and the picture, I was under the impression these were standard sized but I was very wrong. As far as durability they are fine. Just wish they were bigger!"
"Hola: I use these plates daily and have found the plates to be sturdy enough to re-use some of the plates for another meal. I may use two plates at a time if the food is very wet. Before I purchased face masks, I made five masks, using five plates (and ten hair elastics) when Covid-19 shelter in place began. I'd purchase again. Cuidate, CL"
"I've already bought these twice. The first batch, bottom bowl had a slice in it, like someone had cut it while opening the box, but I didn't use a knife to open them, so it had to have been part of a bigger box. Anyway, it was just the one, the very last bowl. That was a surprise with my cereal, lol."
"if i were using the bowls to serve to people i would have been pretty ticked off as none of the 1000 bowls had the pattern that was to be printed on them... i spot checked all 8 stacks after the first few bowls were plain white instead of patterned, for which i paid! i have 10 kitty cats and i give each one a new bowl daily and since it was the first time (and i have ordered these style of bowls, several times a year for a number of years) and my kitty cats don't seem to mind the oopie i will continue ordering them but, i would talk to your quality control unit about their error!"
I feed feral cats. These bowls are the best I've found. They even holds water without soaking up the water and falling apart. For paper bowels they hold their shape and do not fold over or collapse when you're trying to carry more than you should! I will definitely be purchasing again.
I'd like to receive my items in sealed box. Product was OK but considering pandemic I'd like my items in sealed undamaged box. The box was open.
I like that I can buy these in large quantities. Get a little soft with liquids after sitting for a while. There’s sturdier bowls on the market but these work well for the price.
These are great- not flimsy like so many others I’ve bought.
These are definitely not as big as the ones you buy in a retail store
Just what was hoping for & very fast shipping. We will be ordening again. Thank You.
Nice for children to use and carry food to the table without wasting it
Great quality for the quantity value
Held a decent serving and great value for the price.
"Strong coated paper bowls. Sturdier than the regular weight bowls. I use them for cereal, snacks, and as disposable cat bowls."
It’s my fault the 12 in bowl is small but probably for the best for portion control Great value for the price
excellent heavy duty paper bowls
"these are not large bowls..kinda med. size, but it fits a reg. serving easily.."
"these are o.k. yes, they do hold up well and do not collapse when filled. also, they hold the liquid with no leakage or absorbing to product noted. gave it a 4 because they are tiny sized and do not quite compare to Chinet brand."
"This product was exactly as it's described on the website, and so I will definitely be ordering these again."
They are durable long lasting strong and keep food where you put it it doesn’t slide all over the place.
"Only received two in the box, not as advertised"
Prompt shipping and paper bowls are excellent! Thank you.
Purchase these for my kids to eat cereal and soup work wonderfully. I have a habit of cleaning them right away or at least letting them soak in water if I'm in a rush. Love the.
"We use these for our daughters - and historically, their bowls have been smaller and have crevices - and the BPA-free plastic was harder to clean if the food was hotter .... but THESE bowls - Bigger - great shape that prevents accidental spills - and very very very very easy to clean! 10/10 would buy again!"
"I really like these bowls, they are really cute. I bought them for my granddaughters and niece and nephew. I would have liked to have them be a bit bigger. But I do like them."
Needed something kids could use for cereal so my good bowels didn’t get broken. Match great. Love the deep blue color. Good price
These are great plastic bowls. Perfect size for cereal. They clean up great in the dishwasher. Colors are vibrant and fun.
"I love these little bowls. I bought them to mix royal Icing colored frosting for pastry bags, but end up using them all the time. The wash great in top shelf of dishwasher and have held up very nice."
"The stackable baskets are sturdy (but light) and they look like very nice - not like cheap or flimsy plastic. The pink ones are cute - a muted pick that goes with many decors. They are quite small and slim - best for cosmetics or some small groceries - fruit, power bars, etc. I think they'll look great in my daughter's dorm room!"
These bowls are colorful and lightweight! Love them perfect size
Love these bowls! Perfect size for a single serving.. colors are very festive! Highly recommend for all!
They are nice to use.
Great bowls for the price. Love the colors. Easy to clean. Go for them I dont think you will be disappointed.
"I like these bowls because they are inexpensive, come in a great array of colors and fit my hand nicely."
Good little kitty cat bowls. Very easy to clean and goes thru the dishwasher fine.
Nice size and love the colors
These are great bowls. Not microwave safe though
i use it for cerial or food for the table. lots of uses.
These are cute and very nice size
Bought for use at craft show. Satisfied.
Very decent stuff
Very well made. Not cheap plastic. Love these bowls!
perfect little plastic cereal bowls
Bought these for cereal bowls. They work great & hold up well. Just wish they were a tad bigger.
Great and easy to clean cereal bowls. Get them.
Love these bowls
Gift
Love the bowls durable I like the color easy to clean
Good looking and durable.
"very sturdy and durable, we are very pleased with the product!"
Easy cleaning
Muy bien
Very nice bowls i love them
Love it
Ok
I replaced my old kids bowls with these ones and they are so nice and durable. Definitely with the money.
Some came broke. Looks like dollar tree bowls
"I buy this for my daughter. She love this. One of them I do not like - I can't put this in microwave. So if I want feeding my daughter, she always take this bowls, I warm up food in different bowl and put on her bowl. But I understand it is only plastic."
These bowls are great for cereal but don't heat Chili/soup up in them or they are ruined...
Love these medium size bowls. Very sturdy for cleaning.
They were smaller than I thought they would be. Had to return it
I can’t say that I would put these out for company but they are exactly what I needed. For my granddaughters and myself we use bowls for everything and these are perfect size and enough of them to get us through breakfast and snacks !
These bowls are plenty big enough for soup or cereal for adults too. They clean really easy. No problem with grease sticking to them like some plastics do.
"The colors are super cute, good quality and love how many come. Definitely recommend"
My grandchildren love them and use them everyday.
They are nice and sturdy nice size for a ice cream bowl
"I had to resort to these because the kids kept breaking my porcelain bowls! They are a beautiful blue and sturdy for cereal and little ones!! There are 12 so that’s even better since my teenager likes to “lose them”!! Also they are nice size for soup, salad or cereal."
Works for the kids cereal!
"After reading through reviews for this, I bought the ceramic version in the dark gray color. From what I've seen happen to other people's bowls, I decided to remove the lid when microwaving, as I usually do with lunch containers anyways, and when putting it in the dishwasher (top rack) I remove the silicone strap from the lid and do not put the strap in the washer. Sometimes I just hand wash the lid itself. So, my bowl is still in great condition and works wonderfully.  It's not leakproof, so I mostly carry rice dishes, salads, and baked pasta inside, and if I want sometimes that needs a sauce, I pack the sauce in a separate container. I'm satisfied with this product, but it is definitely in part thanks to other reviewers."
"I had been eyeing these W&P Ceramic Bowls for a while now. I found out about W&P when I went looking for a ceramic water bottle. As I looked over their products, you can see why their photos are all over Instagram. Highly rated products and good-looking? Yes, please! These ceramic bowls seemed terrific to have. They are microwave and dishwasher safe. I wanted to use them for leftover storage that turned into my lunch all in one.  I ordered four bowls, one for each member of the family. There are different colors so everyone could get their own. The shipping was quick. When they arrived, each bowl was wrapped in its own box from W&P. The bowls have a ceramic bottom with a rubber bottom. If you drop it in the sink, no clunky sound or breakage. The bowl has solid weight. The plastic cover has a rubber strip attached that loops under your bowl to securely ""lock"" the lid down.  We had curry last week. Everyone used their W&P bowls for dinner. The kiddos couldn't finish their dinner. They added a little more food, put the cover on, and popped it into the fridge. The next morning, they grabbed their bowls to go. I am happy to report there was no spillage, but I am not sure if I would trust it with liquid. The kiddos said there was no problem with reheating AND the rubber bottom made it easy to hold a heated bowl.  The convenience and the multiple uses for the W&P Ceramic Bowl is something our family would definitely recommend!"
"I thought that this product was very nice and durable. I got a lot of recommendations for it because it is perfect for storing your lunches or snacks, like salad, rice, and soup. The only thing about it, is that you can't use it to transport soups around. My friend for whom I bought the bowl for, said that she wanted to try to carry soup in it, said it wasn't good for that, but perfect for her salads. All in all, a good find and a good buy. :) I recommend it as a nice Christmas present for folks this holiday season."
"I LOVE this bowl! Using it make my lunch kit feel more “grown up” and I’m inspired to make my own lunches more frequently. I love that it is ceramic, and not plastic or metal. I wish it were leak proof but, I have a lunch bag that allows it to remain upright and I will be using this bowl for “drier” lunches like grain bowls and salads, not for soups."
"This bowl is great is you’re not trying to transport anything that is really liquid. It’s great size, surprising light for being ceramic, and very easy to clean. HOWEVER, after three successful days of lunch transport I put soup in it and was unpleasantly surprised to find it had leaked EVERYWHERE. You might have better luck if you put the food in hot as it would probably help to activate the vacuum seal. I really love eating my lunch out of something that’s not plastic and I do love the way it looks. Unfortunately, practicality is king for me so I am a little disappointed. You should t have to try and life hack a nearly $40 lunch bowl."
"I purchased a blue Porter bowl from Marshall's. It was marked down to $3 because the band was missing. I didn't realize that was the case until I looked up the brand online. The band is useful if you're traveling and need to secure the lid. I've used the bowl every day for two months. Save for standard scratch marks from utensils, it is durable, holds two portions of food (hot or cold; soups and salads) and is microwaveable. I love the portability of the bowl and the various colors. Opted to buy another this to use for lunch and the first one for food storage.  Two observations: 1. The bowl is too big to fit flat in a standard lunch bag, but since I'm primarily remote, it's not a deal-breaker. I'd rather be compelled to eat more salad 2. Sometimes being fancy isn't practical. Colors include slate, charcoal and black. From the pictures, it appeared that slate would match the gray portable utensil set I purchased from another brand. Slate is more of a light grey. Whereas, charcoal is dark gray and black is black. Even on a color swatch palette, 'slate' grey wouldn't be light grey so marketing missed it on description. To resolve, I returned the light grey and purchase dark grey instead.  UPDATE: 12.27.20 I made the unfortunate mistake of leaving the lid on while microwaving food—this to prevent contents from splattering in microwave. Well, heating for 2:25 minutes was long enough for the ‘microwave safe’ plastic to ‘cook’ on the inside. The result was seasoning melted w/the plastic and after attempting to wash the caked on food off, white ‘moon ridges’ appeared where the bowl was once smooth and dark gray. Mrs. Dash seasoning is still visible in the ridges left behind by food melted in place.  To avoid stains and melting, I normally use Rubbermaid’s glass like plastic bowls (see pic), which I’ve used to heat the same thing and they don’t have holes to allow heat to escape. I paid about $32 for a whole set of Rubbermaid bowls in different sizes. Have had them for > 1YR with no melting. ONE Porter bowl costs $25 and isn’t as durable as it seems. At best, you can use it for sandwiches, fruit, veggies, salads, soup (freeze your soup to transport it w/o spilling), and anything that doesn’t require a lot of heat. With the lid on, the bowl will cook on the inside and that’s both unhealthy and unsafe (bottom side of bowl was hot to handle for minutes after being microwaved).  I was surprised that neither the outside of the bowl nor the lid melted, which is to say that the outside is more durable than the inside. Still, it’s a $25 product so, unless you get a discount, invest in the hard plastic as seen in the Rubbermaid pic. Other things to note: Be practical vs. cute. If 2.25 mins of heat can melt the interior, seasoning and butter together, it will also stain white, pink and mint green bowls. Also, odors from any ‘baked in’ foods won’t disappear even though the bowl is clean."
"I love this bowl! I use this bowl on almost a daily basis to take my lunch to work. I often hand wash it, but put it through the dishwasher several nights ago and it got an air bubble pocket on the bottom of the bowl. Since it is “dishwasher safe,” I contacted customer support about it. They were so helpful and kind and immediately shipped me a new one! I’ll be hand washing mine from now on, and if I ever put it through the dishwasher again, it’ll be on the top rack. Even after that little mishap, I’d highly recommend this bowl!"
"I bought the color blush pink. It matches my other dishware nicely, so I can use it for regular use or on the go. Very durable and the lid is snug (no leaks). Handy for leftovers. I'm happy to pay for quality and design, but this is def on the pricier side and a bit preventative for me in so far as I will wait to get a second bowl."
I loved my bowl but I accidentally dropped it and it all but exploded. I will be much more diligent with my next one
These bowls are amazing. They’re functional and beautiful. I use them all the time.
"Awesome product. Really good to Have reusable containers like this for work-week lunches, and this one is both functional and generally suave looking."
"I love this thing. So easy to use, I use it for lunch almost every day, and just toss it in the dishwasher when I get home."
"I have a poke bowl issue-i eat them far too often. But I was feeling guilty about the amount of plastic i was throwing away every time I got one from the place near my house that doesn't do biodegradable packaging. Got this, used it, LOVE IT"
It is a little heavier than I expected. But really like it.
"What can I say? It's cute, it will keep your food inside, and it's pretty dang spacious. I like it!"
I use this bowl for my lunch salads. It’s a great bowl but not leak proof. It’s also a bit heavy but not a big deal. Also looks pretty 🤩
This bowl is fantastic! It's very well made and feels great in your hands. It has a great functional design as well as a sleek modern look. Works great for lunches or storing leftover food in the fridge. Highly recommended!
"I ordered two porter bowls for my husband's lunch and/or dinners. He loves them so much he wants me to order more. As a doctor he's always running around and often runs behind schedule which found him eating fast food everyday. Now he eats pre-proportioned meals. Anything with liquids like soups, curries or dressings I pack in accompanying Mason jars (see pic). He simply dumps the contents into the porter bowl and heats in the microwave. With salads and vegan bowls he simply adds dressing. I did found the small WP containers to be useless bc it's not enough to cover a 32 oz bowl. Which is why I use small Mason jars instead. Porter bowls are easy to clean, do not retain odors, and dishwasher safe however I DO hand wash the lids. I will be ordering more so all of his his workday lunches are covered and he can focus on patient care. Excellent product!"
"This is a lovely lunch bowl, is it expensive? yes but when you’re sat at your desk eating your leftovers you will feel a million dollars. . Its stylish and easy to clean. A real pleasure to use. Im buying them for gifts for my family b'day and xmas. Stunning colors - i got the greyish one."
I love it is so cute and great quality
Super cute
Muy útil para llevar lonche
I bought this bowl on a whim and it is now my favorite bowl to take to work for lunch. It is just so aesthetically pleasing. It does not advertise as being leakproof so I would not use this for soups but foods with sauce have been ok in this bowl. I also don’t microwave with the lid on. It has held up in the dishwasher fine. I would like to buy more products from this brand but for the price I could buy something more functional and durable. I would recommend this product to others
This bowl changes the game for how I prepare my food. Plan on buying more for me and others
"I bought the W&P Porter Ceramic Bowl Lunch Container w/ Protective Non-slip Exterior with the W&P Porter Water Bottle. As much as I was happy with buying the Water Bottle, The Ceramic bowl didn't live up to my expectations. The bowl comes with a rubber cover that has to be removed when you need to wash it after every use. The lid isn't leak proof with curries. I've had my days with messy office bags. And the durability part: I regret not bought the Plastic version of the product. It is cheaper and might last longer. I dropped it on my way to office and it shattered into pieces. It is dishwasher friendly and scratch resistant though. if you're careful enough, it might last longer."
"I ordered three different sets of W&P bowls, all consecutively, and they ALL came defective, with a stain or finish which looked like water spots. I will add a photo if I can. Very disappointing. Would expect more quality for these, especially for the price. The rubberized finish on the other bowls scratches."
"This is perfect in almost every way: esthetic, function, size. Really elegant. I wish it were a bit more leakproof. If you have any liquid you need to be sure to transport it flat. The other issue is the silicone, which requires some effort to position after washing. It traps air that you have to press out. Not a huge deal but it takes longer than I would like to take. Still, worth it for the otherwise exceptional bowl. Well done, designers!"
I use this everyday since I got it! and I dropped this bowl on the ground yesterday and no scratches at all so very durable. Easy to clean and most importantly it’s super duper cute hehe I love the color so much
I think the price of this bowl is insane but the quality is really good. I'm not sure yet what can be stored and transported in it (I'm using it for yogurt at work) since the seal seems hinky. I think some of the yogurt leaked out by the strap. The inner silicone doesn't seem to sit right to be a tight seal. As for durability it just came yesterday so we'll see. I plan to wash it in the dishwasher most of the time so at $40 it better hold up.
"Love love LOVE these bowls. Honestly I was gifted one by my thoughtful husband, and immediately ran to amazon to buy two more. While they’re perfect for travel salads and Buddha bowls, I was surprised how often I ended up using them at home! Also the colors have been a real boost to my kitchens wardrobe. Starting to look like Bon Apetit up in here! Cheers."
"Really great bowls. I have 7 now and they’re practically all I eat out of. Have your meal and close it right up if you have leftovers you want to keep. I used to eat out of my nice glass Tupperware containers (Neanderthal, I know), but I much prefer these. When you heat the glassware up with your food in the microwave, the glass itself gets too hot to touch; do I really need oven mits for pulling something out of the microwave… very annoying! With these, they’re more insular so they just make sense for me personally."
"I don't know why, but this bowl is so nice, it inspires me to do better with my eating. Now I bring a nice salad every day and feel good about it. I like the texture, weight, it seals great for what I bring."
"The silicone sleeve doesn't stay on the bowl. If I have it in the groove, it creates an air bubble between the sleeve and the bowl. It is annoying to deal with so we don't really use the this anymore."
"Opened it up and was disappointed. $40 on what appears to be a beautiful and durable bowl to find that it's main selling point, the lid, doesnt shut! I will say that the silicone lining on the rim of lid came off immediately so I am hoping that I got a defective unit. I'm giving it a week before seeing if it's unbareable and then exchange. This was not a good first impression.  After a day or two I've found that if you're *very* careful when placing the lid, you get a more stable close, but I'm wary of packing a pasta in even a light amount of sauce."
I take this bowl everyday with lunch. It is the perfect size and is dishwasher safe (I put it in the top rack)
Aesthetically pleasing and perfect size -like a pasta bowl. Washes easily. Great for transporting lunch to work. I have not tested it with soups so not sure if it is leakproof. I use it everyday. Lightweight but has a nice heft.
I have used these for about 10 months and it is my go to takeout container. Looks good and cleans up well.
Upgrade your old tupperware to this stylish and functional air tight for lunches on the go. It's also great for taking snacks on the plane :)
This bowl is very nice looking and big enough to hold an 8 oz. salad. I don’t put dressing on the salad until I am ready to eat it so I don’t have any leakage. Sometimes I fix a salad almost 24 hours before I eat it and it stays fresh.
"This lunch bowl is terrible! Third time using it and it leaked all over my purse and I didn’t have an actual liquid in it, only hummus"
lol... what is a joke.... broken into many pieces upon opening the box... a waste of resources.
Stained after first use. Not worth the money.
This is a pretty bowl (ceramic) but arrived in flimsy packaging so the product box was damaged. I was planning to give this as a gift but it looks all beat up.
"This was used once, it developed significant scratch defects to food interface surface. This suggests a defective surface and possible continued particulate debris and a health hazard. I was disappointed and contacted WandP Porter; their response was nothing more sorry sometimes with metal utensils that can occur. Really!?!?! If your selling something with a surface that fails after one use, you have a problem! What is the degradation debris, is their an overt issue with this coating. They don't have on offer or include a specifically designed utensil and to my review there is no caution of using it as a transport only not serving. It is laudable to promote as an option to single use, but invest in a better designed and produce product---very disappointed Really wanted this to be great--NOT RECOMMENDED, AVOID POSSIBLE PARTICULATE DEBRIS WITH HEALTH HAZARD POTENTIAL UNTIL DISCLOSURE OF THE COATING."
"I use this for my work lunches every day and it's fantastic -- I plan to buy another one. The ceramic feels very ""luxe"" even if I'm just eating lunch at my desk. The mint is a beautiful color and both the bowl and the lid wash super easily."
"Between the plastic and the ceramic, go with the ceramic. Plastic is for those who like this look but IYKYK, plastic is not everlasting and will be harder to protect against scratches and wear/tear."
This is my second day using it and it already leaking and the strap is already breaking !! This is so disappointing as the design is nice ! This is a shame for this price point !
Great bowl.
Daughters very pleased with these bowls. I bought 2. They use them practically every day for lunches. Many colors to choose from. I definitely recommend!
I wish it didnt stain so quickly otherwise its super rad
Lamentablemente puse una comida con salsa roja la cual no pude quitarle el color rojizo
Love this Great quality
"This is a great lunch container, I use it every day! I particularly love the colour and design"
The ceramic bowl has an awesome texture....the packaging was great!
Pretty expensive to have a warped lid that won’t sit on the bowl properly.
"This bowl is great for salads, but if any wet food is but in bowl- it will more than likely leak into your bag if not kept upright. It’s plastic- stains do not wash out. I now have overpriced Tupperware"
The bowl looks so good it makes ur food look delicious.
This is a wonderfully constructed portable food dish. I can take soups without spilling and leaking!
Love it! I use it everyday!
"I like this bowl/container a lot. It has a really nice feel to it, is sturdy and practical. I would buy it again - but NOT in a light color because the plastic stains very easily."
closing strap broke after <3 months of use
"Product is cute and seems like it works well. Although, upon arrival, the box already seemed open and there were a few scratches on the lid. Pretty upsetting given the cost of the piece"
Love the design and the fact that inside is ceramic. However I wish it held the temperature (keep hot food warm). It would be nice to have a smaller option for storing baby's food on the go
I bought this a couple of months ago. I put my lunch in this overnight and came down last night to the bowl completely shattered. This shouldn’t happen.
I have had this I think for two weeks and I got a lot of compliments. However I dropped it on my vinyl kitchen floor from 3 feet and the ceramic shattered. Heartbroken given if I ever wanted to rebuy it's too much money. It is definitely not worth the money since its seal is weak. I only used for salads with no dressing as I only add the dressing when I was going to eat.
I was looking forward to love this item and actually was really motivated to use it and bring lunch to work. After three uses the ceramic broke down the middle and it was completely useless. I presume it's not really made for microwave/heat and just for salads or put things that don't really need heat.
"the design was nice , the color is a bit off from what you get I saw something similar at Barns and nobles for $26"
"I love the look of this bowl, and it works well for my needs. The Bowl is not leak proof, the seal is not very tight but it works really well for salads/ grain bowls. It is a big enough to fit a good meal in and looks fantastic, and really feels much better to eat out if than a plain container."
"This product is not leak proof, not good for carrying anything with liquid, ok for dry items or salad (without dressing)"
Very nice quality. A big oversized for my kids lunches
"I love these because I can make a big salad using these! Of course, I always thing of Elaine from Seinfeld because she always has to have a big salad. ""A big salad, with lots of stuff in it""! Ha, ha."
"Oops! Ordered the wrong size. Happy accident. Getting great use from those larger bowls. I used to hold snacks & sandwiches with veggie sticks, chips or green olives. Works better than a saucer. Food stays on the bowl best. And, yes. I also ordered the smaller bowls later. But both sizes."
"It’s about time that Dixie came out with a large size bowl. Many of the frozen meals that I purchase these days are in bowls that are too big to fit in the regular 20 ounce Dixie Ultra bowls. Until now, the choices were having the frozen bowl sitting awkwardly on top of the 20 ounce bowl, having it sit and slide around on a flat plate or just placing it on the turntable of the microwave taking a chance of burning yourself when removing it. These new Dixie Heavy Duty Ultra 34 ounce bowls are perfect for the current crop of large size frozen bowl meals. Go Dixie!"
"I originally bought these large bowls at Costco. I liked them so much I went back to buy more but they sold out and haven't been brought back. I was happy to find them on Amazon. Great size for a self serving of food. What I like most is they are sturdy and durable. If I don't finish what I have in my bowl, I can put the bowl of unfinished food in a gallon zip lock bag and into the fridge it goes. Later, or the next day if I choose, I can put the bowl of leftovers into the microwave. The bowl is still sturdy. These bowls are leak proof, great for hot soup. Although I've never tried to keep unfinished soup in the bowl."
Wow! These are great for that late night cereal craving! I think paper vs ceramic (dishwasher) is a toss up. If you gently rinse these- I find them Re-usable... maybe only once or twice. I highly recommend them for singles!! 👍
"We use these bowls mostly for popcorn, so the larger size is perfect! We also use them for making oatmeal and grits, so the larger size keeps cereal from boiling over in the microwave! Great for reheating soups too for this same reason!"
"Sturdy. Perfect size for a big bowl of cereal, stew, salad, or whatever. Also handy as a small mixing bowl."
I was violenly assaulted so it's very difficult for me stand and cook.. these bowls are so sturdy they're very convenient they're very pretty and they hold anything. don't buy any other bowls by Dixie.
All e Can say is they are perfect for our needs
These bowls are quite useful when having cereal or small dinners. It comes as described and I needed it speedy but it made here.
Bigger than i expected.
Darn things are so big they would be better plates than bowls. Got them for cereal while we were on a trip. Too big for cereal. Everything else was fine. Quality is what you expect from dixie.
They are very durable and inexpensive!
These bowls are huge!
We live this larger bowls
they are a bit smaller when making canned soup ...
THE BOWLS ARE NICE BUT TO HIGH PRICED FOR THE LITTLE THEY GIVE
They are sturdy and pretty and cut down on my chores. What more could you ask for?
"The mixing bowl is just great. The problem is that I could not visualize the size of the thing from the pictures or dimensions. Turns out it is a lot too big. My wife points out that it is bigger than our dish pan. It definitely holds the batter mix that I make, and frees up the mixing bowl that my wife uses to make soups, it causes problem in the downstairs refrigerator by occupying most of my shelf. I will eventually replace it with a smaller one after I figure out how to gracefully retire this one."
"Should have seen a Red Flag when the bowl was described as, ""Metallic"". This is a flimsy & terribly thin bowl, just waiting to for chance to dent. Warning on bottom: ""Prolonged exposure to foods with high salt concentrations may cause surface corrosion."" Returning. Found much better quality bowls at lower price found locally."
This 1.25 quart bowl fits perfectly inside my Presto pressure cooker. The outside diameter is 7-1/8 inches measured flange to flange. The inner diameter of the cooker is 8.5 inches. This leaves enough room to get my fingers down with a cloth to pull it out. The height is 3-1/8 inch. I can cover it with aluminum foil to prevent splattering with some foods. It is pleasantly light to carry instead of a heavy glass Pyrex bowl and cleaner than a plastic bowl. The small size is convenient for storing leftovers in the refrigerator to be finished off later.
"First let me say, I love it! I bought this as a dish pan for my double bowl sink as I did not like plastic ones. This is exactly what I was looking for. They size and quality was excellent. I have older stainless bowls for cooking and yes they feel somewhat thicker heavier, but the are 40 years old. I would not hesitate to purchase this item for either cooking/mixing or as I did for a sterile dish pan. The shipping was excellent also. It arrived in mint condition and I have been searching for weeks for just the right size and this is it. I was also not a promotional reviewer. This was purchased at full price and reviewed with complete unbiased words."
"My partner and I like to make popcorn -- lots of it. As in, a full cup of kernels in a whirly-pop, pressing over 8 quarts of popped corn. We bought this bowl because we needed a bigger one. This one did the trick.  Clearly identifying the size was tough to pin down by the pics. So, to help, hold your arms out in front of you, overlap your hands, and hold your arms in front of you to make a circle -- basically a human basketball hoop. That's about how big this bowl is. It's about as deep as a tall can of beer or a spaghetti sauce jar.  Also, you should know; It doesn't fit in a normal dishwasher -- hand wash only.  Would buy this again!"
"I LOVE THIS BOWL, I wish I had known that there existed out there a mixing bowl such as this! I have been making dog food for about 11 yrs. and have used various kitchen bowls to mix the raw and cooked, so I use the quick pot, pressure cooker, for the cooked things and use the big bowl for the cold and un-cooked items, when I mix the hot with the cold it takes no time to incorporate them, making the food only warm, and I am able to put the food into plastic containers that I then freeze, thank you so much for the producer of these bowls, I absolutely love mine!!!!!"
"Contrary to what this is usually used for I'm going to use it to mix concentrated pine tar with linseed oil. I do not want to mix large quantities, just enough for the job. That is 1 pint or less of mixture. I wanted a mixing bowl and storage container small enough for left overs from my project. Try finding a 1 pint paint can, nearly impossible. Finding this was kind of a death march, but that's a problem with Amazon's search engine -- it gets confused and tends to steer one in a wrong direction. What is so hard about ""1 pint (or less) stainless steel mixing bowl"" and a ""1 pint (or less) empty paint can"" Amazon needs to rethink their search engine (google is not any better) -- fat chance. Anyway this bowel will do exactly what I want so five stars; who could ask for more. Very happy I could find it... eventually."
"It's a little smaller than she expected but it's actually better than the bowl it's replacing. Nice bowl, no dings. Only thing is she wishes they'd not make the glue on the label so hard to take off. Other than that, good bowl--thinking of buying another one. Update 11/12/19 Wife is really disappointed with this bowl. While it was nice when I bought it, it has started to rust and she's going to dump it as soon as she finds a replacement. It's supposed to be stainless steel."
"My old smokers water bowl finally rusted out. This bowl is wider and deeper, just fits. And with a larger capacity of water I can keep the temperature down for an almost cold smoke, perfect for smoking trout. Cleans up easy and with its stainless steel construction it will probably out last the smoker."
"I got this to mix eggs for an omelette, but it's a good medium size mixing bowl for all around use. It's lighter weight than the traditional stainless bowls I'm used to. At first I thought it was too flimsy. But actually this makes it easier to clean and store and work with. I reach for it over melamine or glass. The high sides make it great for whipping."
I bought this and wanted to get another one. It's a perfect size for me since I live alone. Problem is that I bought the first one for just under $8 and now it's $12. I cannot believe that it would go up that much. I'll keep watching and hope that it goes down again. It's a great size for small-batch bread and quick breads. Update: The price is now $10 more than when I bought it.
"I needed a mixing bowl for my 48 muffin recipe, and this one works great.  APPEARANCE: If you are concerned with the inside of the bowl on the bottom having little scratches from hand-held mixers, don't get this one. Mine looks like all my other mixing bowls on the inside after a few months (but who cares, it's supposed to!)  SIZE IN CUPS: I just filled the largest bowl in a set of mixing bowls with water, and it took about 12 cups. This bowl takes 20+ cups.  STORAGE: I was concerned such a big bowl would literally have to live in the basement, but in fact it nests PERFECTLY with all my other mixing bowls and adds only about a 1/2 inch to the height of the stack. (SEE CUSTOMER IMAGES)  DIMENSIONS: This bowl is 5"" high, 12"" across. The largest bowl in my standard set of mixing bowls is 4.5"" high, 11.5"" across. (see customer images for a picture of them nested together)"
"I bought this not to function as a mixing bowl but rather to be a steaming bowl for inside my pressure cooker. Even at 15psi, the bowl stands up amazingly well and has not stained, warped, or anything else. It's 3 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter. After a cleaning it looks good as new every time."
"This really helps with seasoning my proteins. Instead of getting seasoning all over the counter, i can keep it in the bowl and evenly coat all of the meat. Nifty!"
I’ve been looking for a small bowl like this for cleaning purposes and this one does the job perfect. It’s small enough that I can use it with one hand while the other scrubs and is sturdy enough that it doesn’t tip over when filled with a solution. Would recommend!
This bowl works great for me. It takes up little space in the kitchen and it's great for bread dough. It meets my expectations.
"I use this for making anything that I want to share--bread, cookies, mixing a large meatloaf. It's my most treasured mixing bowl."
"After reading some of the negative reviews, I feel compelled to comment: This bowl has sufficient weight / gauge / thickness for my purposes. It is fine as a mixing bowl, but I'm sure it is not intended to be a food storage vessel. A magnet will stick to the bowl - that tells me it isn't made out of 18/10 stainless steel. But it does do well in the dishwasher. After that, I keep it clean and dry when not in use. This bowl WILL warm up on my induction stove, so it may be suitable for Alton Brown's method of making popcorn. ;)"
I bought this purposely to cook rice with the pot in pot method in the instant pot and it worked in my 6Q Instant Pot Nova. It is very light and I find I’ll use other purposes for it. Pleased
I have had a larger size Fox Run Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl that I have enjoyed. I was trying to get another one the same size and accidentally got this smaller one. I kept it and to my surprise find myself using it a lot and often preferring it to the larger one. The Fox Run Mixing Bowls are of very good quality.
These are perfect! I use them whenever I have alot of chopping to do for dinner. Was super surprised when they came. Took a bit longer for shipping but worth the wait.
I had nothing else suitable for making hollandaise sauce. This works perfectly. It's just the right size. Somewhere I read the ultimate bowl for making the sauce is pure copper and the second best is stainless steel. I'd rather the stainless over copper for the ease of care; I don't think the conductivity of copper vs steel is a great matter. This is a perfectly fine little mixing bowl. When I use it I hold it in my hand over a very low gas flame on my stove. No problem. I have made perfect hollandaise with it.
Perfect size for a couple heads of cabbage and room to mix.
"Can be used in a pressure cooker and can hold about 1-1.5 cups of rice/oats etc, and can also be used to steam cook vegetables (2 to 3 cups. Ideal size for a small family or for 1 or 2 people.  It is a light weight stainless steel and won't take abuses, but if you use it with reasonable care it should last.  Some users have said it rusts, so will have to wait for a few months to see what happens; it hasn't rusted in about a month of use so far."
"Fits right in my pressure cooker. Just what I wanted. I wish all kitchen items would mention the diameter of the bowls and casseroles, etc. The fact that this item mentioned its bowl diameter is the only reason I bought this particular one. Luckily, it's a nice bowl, too."
Great bowl for tossing salads without making a giant mess! It holds a large volume and it useful for tossing popcorn or salads so you don’t make a mess of your serving dishes
Will definitely purchase 2 more of these for a large mobile kitchen. You cannot be without metal bowls like this. You can do anything with them. Cleanup is easy-breezy. Do we really want plastic polymers clinging to everything we mix? These bowls are a must have.
Ordered this years ago and it's still kicking. Gets the job done for sure
"For years I used a large plastic Tupperware bowl for big mixing jobs. It finally cracked so I went looking for a replacement. I saw this and thought I would give it a try even though it was a bit bigger than I needed. It is great! I don't have to worry about it cracking; it is so easy to clean and basically turns into a dish washing basin when I am cleaning up. It is light, durable, and big enough for most any home cooking/baking project. There are also no worries about chemicals in plastic. I would buy more and other sizes if I had the room to store them but this is definitely a great starter piece."
"My wife asked me to find a big mixing bowl to replace her big Tupper Ware bowl which cracked. My only guide was ""big"" for the big salads and other things she prepares for the family. I found this 12 qt beauty. At first she was dubius being metal but she's crazy about it now. 14 inches across the top allows for plenty of room the mix it up. In fact, my daughter recently visited used it and quickly ordered one for her kitchen. They love it and I'm a hero!"
"got the 8-inch whisk along with the fox run 1.25 qt bowl, and they are absolutely perfect for omelettes. i make them just like they do at the omelette stations in hotels. oil in the pan, ingredients added and cooked, two scrambled eggs poured in and played with, let it cook a little, spat underneath and flip the whole thing, top with shredded cheese, let it cook a little more, then fold in half and plate it. perfection."
"Stainless steel, great shape, depth, color, ..its a nice bowl!"
"Loved how big this bowl was! Needed something I could mix with and my food wouldn’t fly out everywhere. Does a great job, the sides are nice and high just like I wanted!"
"These bowels are amazing. Their light weight and large enough to use for about anything you'd like to cook. They are easy to clean and look good to if that's important to you. My large glass bowls are so heavy to use I can't lift them when their full. I love these bowls and would highly recommend them to anyone. They arrived earlier than I expected, so thank you to the company as well. I wouldn't hesitate to do business with them again."
"I make small portions of rice, noodles, beans and potato dishes for the two of us. Just right! This, with my new tall silicone lifter, makes small pot in pot cooking a breeze."
I was expecting to be Disappointed in the size of this bowl but to my surprise it was 2 times bigger than i thought. Very pleased
Goods product. Too small for my needs but looks great. Wanted to see what this line looked like. It is fine!
I was looking for a large bowl and this was just what I wanted. No complaints.
I need a very large mixing bowl. There were several sizes to choose from. This was large and just right.
"Great quality, smooth polish inside and out as well as on the rim. No sharp edges. Appreciate that it is neither too deep nor too shallow. Great size for tossing salads, flouring chicken etc."
"We love kitchen items in our house - appliances, equipment, ingredients... you name it and we've probably got it - it every variety you need. Mixing bowls are a must-have for us but we still hadn't found the one we absolutely love... until now. This is it!! We're now getting one in all other sizes, of course!"
This is easy to use and clean. Is very sturdy. ¬looking forward to using it for many times.
The perfect size for my 6 quart InstaPot. I use mine to make sticky rice without having to soak it overnight.
great price great product MADE IN INDIA which is great .it is not made in China
"I have had this same bowl for at least 8 years, and recently purchased another one for mixing spices that we plan to sell. The newer one has a slightly larger lip than the old one. My old one is a little dinged up has held up well and we still use it. They both fit in a sink, although the new one does not fit as well as the old one."
"I've been using these alot and no rush, no dents, no scratches. Seems well made. I'd buy again."
perfect so tired of ordering dog food bowls that are too small this is a perfect durable solution wish I had thought of it sooner its also a good quality mixing bowl for human purposes lol good quality great price yes yes yes
I use this bowl for just about everything from making pancake batter to dough. I also use it to let dough rise in the fridge overnight . The bowl is sturdy for the price and I have no cons about it so far.
"No wonder you always see these basic looking things in restaurants. They might look surgical, but damn are they useful for cooking. I don't beat my eggs in porcelain any longer, not after these bad boys arrived.  Lightweight, simple, cleans *super* easily, and the bottom doubles as a quick mirror to make sure I look good in the morning before I start my omelette."
"Just the right size to use for peeling garlic. I got two of these. I saw this in a Martha Stewart video: After breaking the clove apart, simply place in one bowl and invert the other bowl on top. Grab the two joined lips of the bowls and shake vigorously. Ta-da: perfectly peeled garlic."
"We bought this bowl after my husband kept using my nice stainless measuring cups on the grill. This works great. It stands up to heat well from what I can observe. It's easy to clean. One caveat--it is very light weight. I think it was almost deceiving at first, but it does it's job and I can't complain!"
"I wasnt sure about this bowl when I ordered it....the price was too good to be true. I thought I was going to get a flimsy thin bowl. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very nice bowl and well worth what I paid. Really big too, I love it for mixing up large quantities."
"These are a great size and shape for scrambling, mixing, etc. The bowl has a nice wide mouth so you can get to the bottom of it."
I bought this to be used as a wash bowl specifically for breast pump parts. I love it as it's just the right size for me. Plan on getting more in different sizes because they would be great mixing bowls!
I like the sturdiness and look of the bowl
Not the thickest material ever but if you are using it to make a batch of cookies every once in a while this thing will be perfect.
"It's awesome to beat two, three eggs in! Even though they didn't deserve to be beaten!"
"A definite must have if you plan on cooking anything besides microwave meals! Bought this in a larger size as well for bigger cooking batches. So far they've been holding up great. We don't have a dishwasher so I can't say how it holds up being washed that way, but I've been very happy with this product."
Perfect size for my needs
These were very nice but not big enough for what I needed.That is the only reason I didn’t keep them.
Three eggs fit perfectly in this bowl.
"If you have kids, or if you're clumsy, this is the perfect cereal bowl. Although not optimal for hot soups, since you can't hold it in your hand without a mitt, it is perfect for cereal. Cleans up easy, takes up much less space than ceramic and it is definitely shatter-proof..."
"All of the other bowls and set were ridiculous expensive for half of this size. I seen this and was glad I have 1 click buying. Lol a Seriously tho, great quality. HUGE. Great to big cakes or anything decent sized. Multiple batches. Dirt cheap. Fast shipping. Cant beat it. 5 Stars."
"This is my Mum’s favorite popcorn bowl. I got it to replace the plastic one she had that always tasted like soap. It’s big, sturdy and so easy to wash."
Top of the Line Bowls ~ Sturdy with Beautiful SHINE TOO!
Great size and great weight for cooking. Highly recommend. Great value for the money.
Just small enough for a couple of eggs in the morning omelette
"I use this as a dog bowl for my 3 pitfalls. It works perfectly, I only have to fill it 2-3x a day which is a wonderful change from having to fill it overtime they drink. It doesn't rust & if you rinse it out there should not be a residue"
"A simple, yet functional bowl. Nothing fancy. Metal is a bit thin, but it's just fine."
"Other buyers commented on a certain ""flimsiness"" in this bowl, but it's the perfect solution for my kitchen needs. Having worked in professional kitchens before, I know there are sturdier bowls out there, but for the price this fits the bill. I only make gigantic recipes once in a while, and this is big enough to accommodate double batches or space-intensive mixing techniques. I think the lighter weight is actually a good thing, and it hasn't dented yet. It lives in the oven when I'm not using it."

"I love these bowls.  I'm a lover of all things noodle: pho, bun, ramen, lo mein, spaghetti, linguini, bucatini, you name it.  I'd been on the hunt for a while for good quality noodle bowls, I looked in my local bed/bath stores, big box retailers, and Asian supermarkets. My primary requirement was a good, heavy bowl: primarily for pho (my first love), and secondarily for ramen (a close second). I wanted something as good as the Asian noodle places I visit regularly. Nothing I saw impressed me. What I found was either made out of melamine - which isn't recommended for piping-hot/boiling liquids - or had very thin walls. I wanted a sturdy bowl that retains heat well, is aesthetically pleasing, and is ceramic (not melamine).  Then I saw these on Amazon and took a chance.  These bowls check all my boxes. They hold a typical serving size of pho (i.e., 2 oz of dry rice noodles, protein, 2-3 cups of broth, garnishes). They also fit a typical instant ramen packet (or your own homemade ramen), broth, and fixins easily. They're at least as nice, maybe even nicer, than the bowls in some of the noodle joints I frequent.  They're simple and traditional in design and color, easy to clean (both by hand and in the dishwasher), and nest well if put away carefully. I've had them for about six months. For the first few months I babied them and only hand washed them. In the last couple of months I tried putting them in the dishwasher and they don't look any worse for the wear. The finish has held up. I'm very pleased.  If any of this resonates with you, don't hesitate and order these bowls now. I'm glad I did and don't have any regrets. I'm actually considering ordering another set as I write this."
"I noticed a lot of variation in reviews. Glossy outer glaze, claims to be made of plastic, orange inner glaze... as of January 2021, we received ceramic bowls with a matte black outer glaze and bright red inner glaze that came out of our dishwasher impeccably. Couldn’t be happier with these bowls 👍"
"These are big, heavy, attractive bowls that each hold exactly 40 ounces of water to the top brim. (If you added another ounce of water it would spill over). These hold a lot of food, soup, etc. Because of the size and weight I wouldn’t recommend for small children, or frail elderly hands. The inside is true red, not orangish or maroonish. I don’t like that there is an unfinished section of red inside one of the bowls making it rough, missing the smooth non-stick coating. I would add more stars if I hadn’t received a defective bowl.  Update - After using these bowls for almost a year I added another star ⭐️ because these bowls rock!"
"I'm ashamed to say that I dropped one of the four when unpacking and it landed on a concrete floor. Not from very high, but ... concrete. AND IT IS FINE! Not a scratch. They're beautiful, lighter weight than you'd expect and perform well in both the dishwasher and microwave. Love them."
"We've been looking for some versatile bowls. These immediately became our favorites. Great look, perfect size, very well made. Mostly we use them for eating out of, for wet or dry foods, salads, soups, stews, rice or noodle dishes, casseroles... Most of the time this is what we eat our dinner out of. They would also be good for small serving bowls, or storage of leftovers in the fridge."
"There's a lot of variation in reviews, but the bowls I got were definitely ceramic, very heavy and sturdy, and colored red and black. I measured and they hold 5 cups of water exactly, so perfect for a double batch of ramen or whatever else you'd need a larger bowl for. One small note as I pictured above, but if you look closely there are a couple of small black specks from where they missed red paint prior to them coating it. This only happened on one of the bowls, the other 3 were fine. I personally don't care since it's not a big deal, and I plan on using the bowls for holding food not staring at for hours admiring the red shine"
These are the best bowls I have seen in a while. They are very sturdy and keeps our soups hot during the entire meal. They are also easy to clean. They can be used for other meals like hot cereal and even mac and cheese. I would recommend these bowls.
"So I ordered this thinking I'd use them as a stop gap after moving and finding my previous dish set smashed in transit. But I have been shocked at how well they've held up after 6+ months. Great outer finish that's more mat black, with a low stick inner coating. Bowls clean up very nicely and I'm pleased with my purchase."
"If you like big bowls, you've come to the right place. You get a 4 pack of microwavable, dishwasher safe, aesthetically pleasing bowls."
"We've been using these bowls for a while now, and I'm ready to throw away our remnant bowls from our college set. These are just way better in every single way. Huge, beautiful, and also they are dishwasher safe and microwaveable. Dunno. Giant ceramic bowls are sort of hard to find. They're just super sturdy, too."
"I've never been so excited to wash bowls! I had been looking for some ramen bowls for quite some time. Reading reviews like a crazy person. Only because noodles and ramen are my favorite thing to eat, and I needed a high quality bowl set that not only looked amazing, but felt like a good weight to hold as well. The price on this set was wonderful for the quality! They're a perfect depth, and have the perfect weight. These bowls are actually so nice, they look like fancy restaurant bowls. Out of the four that I purchased, there were no chips or scratches either. Would certainly buy again!!!!"
"Packaged in foam in a large box. Arrived in perfect condition. They appear exactly as they do on Amazon. I absolutely love them. I bought them along with bamboo placemats, black and red Japanese soup spoons, and black fiberglass chopsticks. It was the perfect addition to my ""Ramen Set"" birthday gift! The recipient loved them."
"These bowls really do feel well made. They have a bit of weight to them which is nice when they are full to the brim with yummy ramen. They are nice and deep and perfect for holding while you eat. They are dishwasher and microwave safe. After a few uses, and runs in the microwave, haven't spotted any of the finish getting removed. So far, these are my favorite bowls in my kitchen."
"Exactly what is advertised! Absolutely wonderful, HUGE, and well made bowls! I personally use them for everything from soup and noodles to cereal and date I say it....Ice Cream! Finish on these is flawless, nice texture to the outside and very easy to clean. Definitely would give as gift or recommend!"
"Holds a perfect pot of ramen. Yes, I said pot. I wish these were made in Japan rather than China, I would have paid more money for that but these are good. Strange product name but these bowls are great."
"This is the third set of bowls we've bought on Amazon, and the only ones to make it to the house without breakage. The packaging holds each bowl so that it does not touch the others. They are *not* nested. They're the same lacquer-red color found in Japanese restaurant bentos. Everything looks appetizing in these. (Exceptions might be tomato soup and some meats.) The size is good for a nice big salad or a good amount of noodle soup -- or even cereal for those days when you just can't deal with cooking."
"I got them for the size and color. Great for that. Really good quality and easy to clean, beautiful look. I think these were made by hand because the inside red color is the same color for each but uneven sometimes, but not in a bad way. It makes me think someone took the time to paint it. So besides being pleasantly satisfied by what I got, I like them even more now. Makes me think I got something at a good price, that could cost much more, like the handmade expensive dishes."
Needed a much larger bowl than the standard bowl due to my large appetite aka extremely high metabolism and I use a lot of energy throughout the day due to my job. This fits about 2 top ramens for microwave use or could probably fit 4 ramens if you cooked them on the stove. The only downside is that it says its microwave safe but it has an odd smell when microwaving. Its also feels a bit hotter than most standard bowls but could be due to it being made out of ceramic.
"Are the reviewers for other bowls going to read this and turn GREEN WITH ENVY? I thought that I was buying those very light wooden bowls that were painted red & black. HOLY SMOKES, these are heavy, heavy, heavy. Love it! And look at the photo to see AN INDESTRUCTIBLE PACKAGING....good god, this could survive a nuclear explosion. Just in absolute pristine condition in this packaging. Buy it. Love it. Enjoy it for life."
"Bowls 5 out of 5 The color is beautiful red in the center and black outside, they arrived in perfect condition and were packaged really well. It even came with a recipe on Chinese noodles! Wow!! That’s great! The bowls are a beautiful color red, not orange. The bowls do hold a lot of liquid. I love that they are dishwasher safe, oven safe, and microwave safe! I will order more because 4 bowls might not be enough!"
"I love noodles and I love the deepest of the bowls and the color, I can't wait use them"
"Actually, I was looking for a Japanese-style pottery noodle bowl and hadn't been able to find one. I saw this bowl and decided to give it a try. I am very happy with it. It is well-made, attractive and well-designed for its use. Nice."
"We love these bowls. They are perfect for salads, soup, cereal.... anything. Makes sure you don’t spill since the walls are higher than most bowls. Only style bowls we keep at home now. Great quality. Thick ceramic."
"These bowls are almost perfect for what I wanted. The one, minor thing I have with these bowls is that there was one bowl that has a small area (smaller than peppercorn) that the paint didn’t cover before the ceramic bowls were fired and baked the paint to the ceramic. But I still love these bowls and would recommend them to anyone."
Love the colors and if your a person that always goes for them seconds then this bowl is definitely for you. It's massive deep bowl to me is more then 2nds I just love it. VERY EASY to clean and store cause they stack on each other. 4 bowls for someone who by then self or has that one bestie who occasionally kicks it.
"I've had these for several months now and they still look great and clean easily. The only thing I'd mention is that the bowl radiates the heat of the food in it very well. If the soup is boiling hot, the bowl will also be boiling hot, so don't plan on moving it after you fill it up."
"If you want a bowl that you'll be happy using the rest of your life, this is it. Very sturdy, super easy to clean, great size for large portions. The bowls are good enough to prompt me to write what sounds like a paid review for them. Seriously, I bought two sets of these and I don't want to use anything else."
"Well packaged, beautiful bowls. They are a perfect size for bun (a family of Vietnamese cold noodle dishes), and we'll be using them for pho next week. Since I was unable to find the dimensions for these, I'll provide them for others' benefit: 6-1/4"" wide at the top, and a bit more than 3-1/2"" tall including the base. Extremely glossy and richly colored. Elegant!"
"These things are great. They look great, they are sturdy and they hold heat. I've also had one hit the floor from counter height and didn't even get a chip. Well done."
"These are simply outstanding bowls. They are sturdy, easy to clean, have large volume, and look good. I use them nearly everyday and own two sets. Also, they come out of the microwave at easy to handle temperatures. A great product at an attractive price."
"These bowls are beautiful (so much nicer than I expected for the price). They arrived in perfect, well packed condition. I cannot wait to use them."
These are some of the best bowls I've gotten heavy strong well balanced and over all awesome color is great cleans very well. They hold alot too. Get them ull love them. Hoping to get more when I have money cash to get them again.
These are excellent bowls at a great price. I use them for salad as they are deep enough to make a good sized salad and still have room to mix. Easy to clean the sink or dishwasher. Very durable. Bowls are heavy and sturdy. Highly recommend them
"I am happy with this purchase. They look great, are very sturdy thus they hold heat well to keep the meal warm. Also they work well against your lips for getting the last of your soup. Unfortunately they do not stack well so they do take up much space."
"These bowls are exactly what I was looking for, they are very well made, deep, and easy to clean. Other reviews say they scratch easily and I get that, the outside is a matte finish, however, the inside remains perfect even using metal utensils. If I do have to replace them every few months or so, so be it I will gladly do so."
"I bought these and they were way better than I expected. I thought they would be a sort of plastic but they are heavy glass ware. Thy work great and the first time I made ramen in them, they made me so happy. I will most likely buy a second set."
"I've had these for the last few months and they're amazing. I've used them from everything from Salads, to Pasta Dishes, to Deserts and they're just fantastic. Clean super easy in the dishwasher, they're simple to hold with a good bit of heft and they're easily stackable. While they do like to retain their heat from the microwave they're no worse than any other plastic bowl I've used.  Absolutely worth it."
"I love these bowls, I searched everywhere for giant ramen/pho style bowls these do not disappoint, they have a great weight, they are hefty ceramic, if you drop them they will break, worth the price, perfect soup bowls. Best part they are dishwasher and microwave safe."
"These are amazing! And not just for noodles either, though they really excel in the noodle department. But I think my almost more favorite use is cereal! You can put a LOT of cereal in one of these things, and it is so satisfying. They are easy to clean, and I love them. I need more!"
These are very nice and sturdy bowls. They are very deep also. Best part is the Georgia Bulldawgs Colors. So hurry up and buy yours today and show off America's Team Colors!
"Nicely packaged when they arrived. Very minimal blemishes, wont notice them unless you look very closely. Can easily hold close to 38 oz."
"These are my new favorite bowl. They are great for soups, stews and noodles. The high sides keep food from slooshing out. The only downside is they are bigger than you think and I have a tendency to fill them and then get full before the bowl is empty."
"These bowls are larger than I expected, but that's no disappointment! They're attractive in their simple decoration, and extremely practical in their shape. Rice, soup, stew, cereal, ice cream... Whatever you want in a bowl, the shape and size of these bowls works very well. I've parked all my other bowls, and will be ordering more of these."
"These bowls are excellent for noodle dishes, soups, and rice bowls like katsudon. They are the perfect depth and width. It doesn't hurt that they're pretty too! If you're looking for a nice set of deep bowls, these will probably make you very happy."
"the color of these bowls are so deep and pretty, they are strong and very thick. they are deep and hold a lot, it doesn't hold all of my pho when i order it from the store though. besides that, i highly recommend these bowls"
Bowls are heavy duty quality but they do get rather hot in the microwave.
A beautiful combo color with red and black. Oven and microwave safe. An elegant way to serve Asian foods.
I love these bowls. I use them for ramen and pho and they are amazing.
The bowl is great for soup and quite decorative for the table. It is a good product.
I had a set of bowls I bought at Target a decade ago that were starting to chip. The biggest issue was finding another large bowl for re-heated meals and cereal. They don't sell large bowls on the shelf anymore it seems.  These have been a perfect replacement so far. I took my old janky ones to work as throwaways.
"I didn't think I'd ever be this happy over bowls. But they are premium quality and are all flawless! I'm so excited to use them!  Thank you, Kook for this superior quality product!"
Large deep personal bowls. Great for pho or anything else you want to eat. I like them. They are wide and deep enough to put a filling amount of soup or any type of food in them. I also like the black on red color scheme. Simple and looks good.
"The bowls are a thick, sturdy material. Super easy to clean and look great. We've been using them for about six months and no chips or scratches. Perfect for soup, stews and noodles."
"Very high quality with plenty of room to pour your noodle servings into without overflowing. They look brand new coming out of the dishwasher. I am sorry I can not confirm if they are microwave safe, as I do not plan on using them that way. They are far too nice to try. The quality exceeds mu expectation at the price of purchase."
"Great size, thick so heat isn't an issue love them  OPEN WITH GLOVES OUTSIDE! PACKED WITH FIBERGLASS!"
"Product came just as described. Was packaged sturdily. It's easy to clean due to it being dishwasher safe, though I always recommend hand washing painted ceramic items. Extremely versatile in whether you want to serve soup, cereal, or any other food items in these bowl. Highly recommend!"
"Perfect bowl, especially for Asian dishes. Beautiful true red and black, ceramic holds the heat better than plastic and feels better too. Perfect size (not too small) and well made. Packed to arrive without breakage."
"They are very heavy ceramic. Not cheap easy to break stuff. Large and deep, great for any soup, chili and rice. Fit well in hand."
"These things are incredible durable and easy to clean. They fit a lot more volume than you initially think and great for rice bowls, ramen, soup, etc."
Perfect set of soup bowls. Look is exactly as shown. If your cabinet is small then storage can be an issue. Highly recommend for Pho soup and other Asian dishes.
I need a bowl that was big enough for a takeout order of Pho. These are perfect. They are big enough without being too big. dishwasher safe microwave safe and pretty with the black and red.
"The bowls are great, they ended up being a bit larger than my roommate realized they were but honestly I find that to be a plus. They're beautiful and they distribute heat really well so it's easy to put food in straight from the stove and walk away with it without any fear of the bowl getting too hot to carry. The base is sturdy and doesn't get hot even when the rest of the bowl does."
easy to clean great colors worth every penny to me
Use these bowls a lot! Love them. Nicely made; deep and colorful. I put them in the dishwasher and microwave often with no problems.
"The bowls are large, sturdy, and -- best of all -- they're mostly radio-transparent. When you microwave your soup, the bowl doesn't become hotter than the soup."
"We really like these noodle bowls! They are restaurant quality—heavy duty and beautiful! I have not had them very long, but they seem to be durable."
"Great bowl, feels good in your hands."
Lived in asia 7 years Vietnam 17 years Taiwan traveled extensively throughout Asia and these bowls are the real deal. Beautiful and made wonderfully
"Love These Bowls! They're Big But Not Too Big, Durable & So Cute ♥"
"These bowls are the perfect size for a full sized ramen or stir fry delicacy. The 'wood' interior contrasts well with the food, much better than black bowls of a similar design. The notches for the chopsticks work well, even with my industrial strength Ka-Bar set (you really *must* look those up!). Comes with chopsticks (just 'ok' plastic ones) and a pair of ladles that are surprisingly useful. The dipping sauce dishes are a little too shallow for use with sauces I find, but work well with sliced ginger, wasabi, etc. Overall, a terrific value."
"These bowls are awesome. They look great, hold a lot of food and appear to be unbreakable. I’ve only had them for a week but have used them twice already. They also fit perfect in your hand for those meals where you are sitting on the sofa eating your meal while watching tv. Two thumbs up!"
The ramen bowel is great to use with beautiful touches. It can be used for all kinds of noodles or food. I recommend this bowel to everyone.
Its the right size for us. We like it like it and its easy to clean! Pretty sturdy too. Like that it comes with chopsticks ladles and saucers.
To be honest I was a wee bit disappointed that the bowls where plastic but the sauce dish's are ceramic. But I still like them. Really big bowls so that is a plus. The ladles are to big and thick to actually use them to sip your soup with. And the chopsticks are so long. Don't get me wrong I will use them but you may want to find new spoons/ladles much thinner. Otherwise it's ok for now but it's not what I wanted in total.
This is just perfect for what I was looking for. The bowl is light so this is perfect for TV dinner. You get chopsticks and sipping spoons/laddles which are so cute. I'm very satisfied.
"I like it’s light wooden color inside, looks really good in the photos! Nice design with a place to put chopsticks."
"Came in good packaging so as to not come in damaged. Tried one out after washing it. Can seem to hold about 30 0z of volume. The spoons are a definite help, I can pick up good amounts of broth for my ramen noodles. I did not use the chopsticks though."
Their light weight and the chopstick rester is so cool and convinient!
"These are not inexpensive bowls. They're actually quite expensive for what they are, but I really loved the vibrant colours. Sadly, even as expensive as they are, do not expect them to be durable, or to last. This is what you can expect from these bowls over time. A strange, grainy white substance extruding from the silicone. Wash it off all you want, it will come right back. Not something anybody wants in their food. Very disappointed that these lasted such a short amount of time. I wouldn't recommend anyone spend the money on this product."
"I got these for a friend who has tremors in his hands, but loves his morning oatmeal. Now he heats up his oatmeal in the microwave without having to use big awkward pot holders or oven mitts because the bowls stay cool enough to handle without mitts. We've tried ceramic, plastic, and glass bowls, and when he is not worrying about burning himself, he is worrying about dropping the bowl and breaking it resulting in a big messy problem. So far, he has not burned himself or dropped anything. He now uses these bowls for other foods he needs to heat up. They have contributed greatly to his independence."
"After scrounging through my backpack and searching the gatehouse up and down for some to heat and eat my emergency can of Pork n' Beans I decided that I needed something more than the random coffee mug I found in the gatehouse, then cleaned in the bathroom sink, to heat my food in.  Decided to go with these because I was a fan of this brand's silicone drinking cups that I bought from a general store here in the mountains of NC.  After one use I'm already hugely impressed with these bowls.  They handled the heat of a 1000 watt microwave with ease and the silicone makes for easy washing of something messy like alfredo I ate for dinner.  I'm certainly going buy another set so I have enough bowls for family camping trips."
"These look great, have fun colors, you can freeze them, bake with them and they are pretty much unbreakable. Dishwasher safe too. Slick texture inside, matte texture outside. Use for hot soup, cereal, ice cream, microwave leftovers - can take very extreme temperatures. The miracle or silicone... They hold just about 2 1/2 cups of liquid (~591ml)  Only caveat is they have a slight ""rubbery / silicone (?) odor or off gassing even after several runs through the dishwasher, hand scrubbing and even cleaned with a 2:1 bleach mixture. It's not as strong as in their pint glasses but still noticable. Not a deal-breaker for me though. Hopefully with time it will fade because I really enjoy using these and the kids love em too. Very cool product!"
"I actually ordered these to replace the ceramic food and water bowls for my older dog. As he ages he doesn’t see and hear as well. He became fearful of the plinking sounds made by his collar tags and the dry food hitting the ceramic. I tried plastic but they still make noise and they slide around. These silicone bowls are quiet, they stay in place, and they’re dishwasher safe. The colors are nice and they are good quality."
"These bowls are great! I bought them for making oatmeal on the road. You can stuff them into your duffle or carry on with no worry and less weight. So I run several races a year away from home and have oatmeal before each race. Round containers cook the slow cook oatmeal more evenly because they have no corners so if I am staying in a hotel with a microwave or camping out, I can have my pre-race oatmeal in style. With blueberries, of course."
"We had previously found SiliPint drinking tumblers, with lids and straws, at local stores in Lincoln County, Oregon. So I was excited to find these matching bowls on Amazon. They work great in the microwave, and no pot holder is necessary for picking them up after the food is heated. Food doesn't stick to the bowls, making clean up a snap--but they fare really well in the dishwasher, also."
"I like to make mug cakes and brownies, but they usually stick to a mug or bowl, but not with these! I've used them several times so far in the microwave and the clean up is the easiest ever! Either a quick swipe with a soapy brush or throw in the dishwasher. I also like that even right out of the microwave, they aren't so hot you can't handle them. So I mix, microwave and eat all out of the same bowl. Less mess and so easy. LOVE these so much!"
"I love the bowls. I went back for 2 more. They work well in the pressure cooker. However, I would not recommend the cups since they absorb odors (I made hot chai). They are fine for camping."
These were the first Silipint bowls we've purchased. We have about 20 of the Silipint cups now and plan to buy more bowls for our son to take to college with him. Don't need to worry about dropping and breaking them and they clean easily.
I bought this two pack of bowls after buying the silly pint drinking cups and I got to say I love them almost more than the pints it is heatable microwavable easily cleanable super easy to use and the nice thing is I can put it in my lunch box for soups and stews and whatever and have it at work and it’s flexible enough that it’s not awkward or breakable
"I use them everyday for everything but I wish they would offer them in more neutral colors, too. I got sick and tired of those psychedelic colors but I had to choose those because I couldn't find any other silicone bowls for adults."
"These bowls are the best ever! They feature a unique, kind of “rubbery” feel that is a delight to hold in the hand. We have a son with special needs and he absolutely loves these bowls, because they are bright, colorful, fun, and so easy to grip! Worth every penny, in my book!"
"I hate to clean up broken glass (or hard plastic)--you ALWAYS find more of it later, no matter how carefully you clean/sweep/mop. These bowls are fabulous! They don't break--they bounce! Sure, they will still spill their contents if dropped full, but I've never been cut by cereal or snacks--only glass. When things ""shift"" in our RV (just like the luggage bins on a plane) I don't need to worry about these dishes tumbling out and breaking--plus, being rubbery, they don't slide around in their storage area! And the grandkids love the bright colors and the fact that they don't need to worry about Grandma's ""good dishes"" when they're over! I will be ordering more!"
"Bought these for use in my RV. Wanted something unbreakable that was microwave friendly. Got all that and more! These bowls wash up beautifully, are not too hot to handle and don't require use of cozy or hot pad. I am beyond happy!!"
"These bowls are awesome! I got them for my boyfriend and my cereal bowls. They're a little expensive but so worth it. They're super durable, thick material so they're not flimsy and they're dishwasher safe! They're also really pretty and fruity pebbles looks so good in the rainbow one lol"
Great bowls for indestructibility. Saw them on YouTube for camping and became interested. Turns out to be great camping bowls😎
I use these bowls to feed and water the strays I feed. The water doesn’t freeze as fast in winter and when it does freeze it’s easy to empty.
My dog is anxious and always gets scared when his tags hit his metal or glass bowl and to makes a noise. These are perfect! I like how they are weighted at the bottom so it’s harder for him to tip them over. 10/10
"The bowls are big and durable and so cute!! My son constantly requests his green bowl for everything. Yes, they are on the expensive side, but I haven't found a better bowl than this and I've bought a ton of different BPA/eco friendly etc stuff. And they're super cute!!!!!"
"Excellent bowls. Bought 2 a while ago to try out. Good size. They wash well, are very sturdy and versatile. I'm thinking about buying more in the nearest future. If you have kids - these are the way to go!"
Theses are thick and sturdy. I love them. These are so much better than plastic. I love them.
"Can't give these bowls enough props. Can put anything in them. They are sturdy but flexible, and have a great soft feel - not to mention they are beautiful and super easy to clean and use. Loved them so much, got a set for my sister and best friend too as a cute present."
"Quality all the way! Nice and thick so they do not lose their shape. Works if I am having cold cereal or fruit and is microwave safe for oatmeal. The best part is that these bowls will never break. I expect to be eating breakfast out of these bowls for years to come. Perfect for the RV, too!"
My favorite for eating any meal while seated on the coach watching TV. Comfortable to hold. Quiet while using utensils. Cooks in microwave or oven. Stores leftovers. Washes easily. Cheerful colors.
Perfection I wish they made plates If you don't like spoon on hard surface buy these bowls. I'm so pleased expensive but worth every penny.
"I've come to really enjoy silicone containers. They clean easily, stuff doesn't stick to the insides. Unlike metal bowls, hot foods don't make the outside too hot to touch, and they don't melt like plastic might melt. Silicone will melt/burn if placed/left on open flame though."
"I love these bowls. I live and travel in an RV so I appreciate anything that is unbreakable and has multiple uses. These bowls are flexible but sturdy and not flimsy at all. They nest neatly for storing. They are the perfect size for soup, salad or cereal or what have you. They go from the microwave to the table and the vibrant colors are terrific."
"I have one kid that is sensitive to sound. Especially the sound of the other kid eating cereal. These bowls solved that issue. Dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to fill with liquid and lift with one hand without the bowl collapsing on itself. Great product"
"Use for candle making. When, I don’t find it dirty in the sink. Seems it’s now the kids favorite cereal bowls."
"These are so visually appealing and are perfect for snacks. Every time I use one, it’s a tiny joy in my life."
"Love these bowls. Durable, sustainable and has many uses other than food/snacks. Great for outdoor use as well. Pricey on the front end, but pays for itself many times over."
"These bowls are so fun and useful. You can put them in the oven, squish them up and shove them in a bag or even throw them on an open flame. I got them for burning man but use them in everyday life and regularly get comments/compliments from guests. Will be buying a few more."
"I just tried these in my air fryer to reheat some leftover nachos, they worked great!"
Perfect for camping in our travel trailer.
"Thanks to these bowls, I no longer want to murder my husband when he eats ice cream."
"You can do anything with these bowls and the cups, too, and not hurt them. My grandson loves them, too. Expensive but worth it."
"Not only are these bowels beautiful and strong, but they are naturally non-stick! Sometimes don’t even need dish soap to clean them after using them. Everything just rinses off with hot water under the faucet. Awesome product."
Love the bowls for lunch warm ups at work or use at home. Simple and work perfectly while being environmentally friendly. Goodbye to paper and plastic bowls as these just work better and do not leak.
I’m using these bowls for my dogs because they can be used in the microwave.
not a real fan of color but the grandkids loved them. Great for microwave oatmeal
I love this product. I use it on my fryer !!
We like egg puffs. It's just scrambled eggs with no additions. It tastes great but it would stick terribly to out china or glass cookware. My friend recommended using silicone bowls. These are rather larger than I had wanted but they definitely WORK. I'm thrilled that they work so well. Now egg puffs are cooked more often!
I replaced plastic dog food bowls that have scratches and teeth marks. Much easier to ensure thorough cleaning.
Awesome. Bought for microwave-tempering chocolate. Use it for just about everything
Great bowls for camping. We are using it for dog bowls and they don’t slip on the floor
"Colors were fantastic, very sturdy,easily cleaned. Fast shipping- great product"
Great for my disabled adult son! Fun colors.Back for more! Perfect for accidents & occasional tantrum!
"Easy to use, colorful, easy to clean..... good size"
These are great for kids!!
Love these! Colorful and fun. Easy to clean. Highly recommend!
These are cute and virtually indestructible! I love them!
Love these for the dogs. Easy to clean. Won’t break.
Great colors and products
Great bowls. We like the cups too. Kids
"Product is as described, quality production. Bowls are of a good size, ridged but flexible."
Vivid Colors: wow! Cool Grippy texture: wow! Unbreakable: wow! Heat safe: wow! Getting compliments: wow! Just….WOW!!
Love everything about it.
Just what I wanted works well
We use these daily and I do hand wash.
Awesome product!
"Fun colors (I bought the 4-pack), easy to clean, unbreakable...and ""quiet""! No spoon/fork noise, so it's also really great for stealth eating of ice cream. ;) I have arthritis in my thumbs and can drop things easily, so these bowls are a plus. The steep sides taper from a nice sturdy base. I've microwaved them (no problems), but haven't used them in the oven yet.  Adding to my original post: I took one of these with me while traveling. Nice to be able to stuff it in luggage and it won't break. Really appreciate being able to heat up food in the hotel room's microwave, and it cleans easily as well. I like them so much that I ordered another set!"
"I brought these bowls in my carry-on suitcase to eat healthy meals in hotel room. Easy to travel, easy to clean, would recommend for hotel, kitchen, camping, etc. The color is fun too!"
"I love everything about these really pretty and fun bowls. I love them so much I ordered 4 more. Have to have enough for when the grandkids are over. They might cost a bit more, but they are well worth it."
Love this bowl! My toddler cannot break it!
These are perfect for camping!
"These were ordered as a gift but I know the person will love them! Only thing I would not was bowls come in a box, not wrapped or anything. You just open the box and there they are lol"
Fun fun fun... Easy to clean and I don't worry about the grandkids breaking them.
I absolutely love these products!! I will be ordering more!!!
"Looking at silicone bowls online, you can't be sure what you might be receiving. The containers are super thick. Having the bowls thick means, you can add a lot of food and not have it wobble or want to bend. The bowl stays a bowl and is not prone to spilling. The thickness also means you can heat your food in the microwave to the point of boiling and still be able to hold the outside of the bowl without burning your hands. I use many spices in my cooking, and these bowls do not take on stains or smells. Clean up is easy. Worth the cost, I am glad I bought the four-pack. Now the company needs to make covers/lids."
Just what I needed to hold my fruit! Nice and sturdy!
Holds all the fruits my children love to eat!
I love the simplicity. Good sturdy bowl. No Complaints.
sturdy and nice basket
Very cute fruit bowl
Love it!!!
"I'm very happy with this bowl. I don't buy a lot of fruit at a time because, well, it's just me and I hate to see the stuff go bad. This size bowl is perfect for me and the shape is nice and shallow, so the fruit's not piled up on itself. I also like the wire design because it allows for good air flow. The wires are a good thickness and the bowl had no wobble or give to its shape, so I'm reasonably certain it's sturdy and will be a durable piece that will be in my kitchen for a while. I think the price is not outstanding, but fair, especially considering the amount of time I'd spend trying to find something similar in a bricks and mortar store. I'm very pleased with this order and, if your needs are similar to mine, I think you will be, too."
"Stylish, looks nice if you have a white counter. It is about 11 inches in diameter. Big enough to put a bunch of bananas and few other fruits. I wish the 'three dots' at the bottom could be removed. There are three ball-shaped dots at the bottom, and I guess they were designed for airflow. But, this design also affects the balance of the basket. It is easily unbalanced if you put fruit on one side."
"This holds a lot of fruit and is shallow enough that the fruit isn’t stacked too high on each other. I’ve found that this bowl has helped my produce stay fresh longer. Previously, I was using a deep ceramic bowl. I like that it doesn’t take up too much space on my counter and it looks nice. For the price, you can’t beat it!"
"CAXXA Countertop Fruit Bowl, Wire Basket for Fruits, Breads, Vegetables,Snacks, BLACK  Got this because my husband has been eating more fruit lately, but if it's in the fridge or in a bag, we tend to forget about it until it's gotta be thrown out. This basket is just like it's in the photo, a wire basket, with some protruding 'feet' to stabilize it (the feet are not rubber, just wires). It's pretty large, good for some banana's and citrus. (See my photo). I like that it's a bit shallow but wide."
"It's a wire basket, perfect for holding fruit. The black metal frame looks good anywhere, and the construction is reasonably solid and stable. I expect this to do its job for years to come."
This product is very versatile. It can be used for fruit or other random things that need to be organized!! Currently we are using it for small fall pumpkins. The black color makes it match everything and it does not slide around on our table
The basket is simple but elegant. Also having this shape meansi can see all the fruit I have out and I’m more likely to eat it. The old bowl I used just showed the top. And this fits a lot more. You can use it for anything. I’m very satisfied!
I love this wire fruit bowl. It is functional and it looks great sitting on the table. Highly recommended. I love it.
"Sturdy and functional fruit basket. Fairly large, holds about 1-2 weeks of fruit for our household of 2."
This is a great fruit and veggie bowl. I like that my food can get air and not rot! It’s a nice looking bowl too!
"This basket is just what I wanted. It goes well with my decor and is actually designed well to hold fruit. It holds quite a bit of fruit and the wire allows air to circulate so the fruit in the bottom doesn't go bad as quickly. It is sturdy too. Overall, a great value."
"Wire bowl is great for fruit. The bowl is made of sturdy metal. There are feet on the bottom, so that it us slightly raised off the table or countertop. The slots are close together so no fruit falls out. Very decorative looking. Also good for use with other foods like rolls or taco shells."
I was using a serving bowl and my tower of mandarins would tumble out or spoil because there wasn’t enough breathing room. This bowl is generously size and looks nice in my kitchen.
Heavy duty but like that it does not have the banana hanger. We prefer the banana hats-keeps the bananas from bruising much longer than hanging.
Perfect fruit bowl! Good size for on top of my toaster oven!
This bowl is just what I wanted to hold fruit on my kitchen counter. The size is perfect and it holds lots of fruit of different variety. Great purchase. Thank you Amazon
So nice
"My wife and I regularly cook meals with rice as the main carb element and many of these dishes benefit from being able to lay down a bed of rice at the bottom of the bowl followed by laying the stew/sauce/veggies on the top of the rice. Many of the standard bowls you can get at grocery stores are a bit too shallow, great for a bowl of cereal or tomato soup, but not large enough to contain a full multi-element meal. The kind of meal that benefits from putting it together in the bowl. These S&Q bowls fit that role perfectly and I would highly recommend.  They have been through my dishwasher a few times and have performed admirably. They are also a beautiful pattern and are nice and sturdy."
"These bowls are beautiful and are a great size! They work well for rice dishes, ramen, cereal, ice cream, popcorn; you name it, it’s a great bowl for it! I love that they arrived to be quickly and that they come in a set of 4! I got them in black and they’re so pretty. Will definitely purchase from this brand again. Highly recommend! (See photos for hand/bowl size reference."
"I like larger portions, in salads, cereal, most everything. I've been looking for a larger bowl that was was between a serving bowl, and a traditional bowl size, and this one is great. The stoneware had a bonus in that it is also oven safe, which I was not expecting. The texture of the bowl is good for handling, while the edges are smooth for drinking the remaining milk from cereal or broth from soups. I'm not easily impressed, but this was the best bowl set I've bought in my (admittedly long) life. I highly and whole heartedly recommend!"
"These bowls have a textured finish, but a smooth feel to the surface. Same size as the beige ones we bought afew months ago. I shattered one on the patio, hence the need for a replacement. Liked the blue better, so why not. They hold up well in the mic, sink, dishwasher, general kitchen use. Just can't treat'em like a basketball. They are, afterall, ceramic. Same excellent packing like the last set."
"These are nicer than I expected and clean up easily. They go through the dishwasher with no problems, even though their surface is textured. Good size for a breakfast bowl. Would buy from them again. If I need to replace any other dishware in future, I'll look for this brand. Impressive for the price."
They are HUGE great for soups and cereal and any LARGE PORTIONS and I love the color
These were a gift for my brother. He loves them. They hold a lot. Heavy and sturdy bowls.
Easy to clean and does not stain with Tomato based foods. Great for salad or cereal. I ordered a set for my son! He came over to my house and was very impressed with the bowls! He and family love the size!!!
"I love these bowls because they look great, they're easy to clean, and they're very solid. They were exactly what I was hoping for, and I liked them so much that I ordered another set."
Very Nice and sturdy bowls. I like the texture of the bowls. Would buy again.
"The bowls are perfect! They are very sturdy and thick--great for chili, cereal, salads, fruit, and anything you need for something deep and wide. They have a speckled, shiny finish I wasn't expecting that makes them even better! They are very beautiful. I wish I had ordered another set. These are awesome!"
"Great deep bowl, love eating big bowls of soup, this bowl has enough room for a full can with plenty of room for crackers etc"
"It was going to get 5 stars across the board, until this morning is when noticed a small chip on the rim of the bowl! Trust me I wanted to cry when I saw it."
Purchased for sons knew place. He loves them! Great size for big bowl of cereal or salad!
"Nice sized, sturdy bowls. Not meant for small portions"
"High quality, beautiful aesthetics the right dimensions to make them perfect for many types of food and uses."
A little too heavy
The bowls are high quality and look nice. I got the blue ones.
"these are beautiful, large well made bowls."
The bowls hold water.
"These bowls are prettier, larger and better quality than I had expected from the description. Recommend!"
"Thank you S&Q Ceramics for these larger bowels i like them very much ! Just what i needed for cereal, soup and much more!"
Bowls are great
These bowls arrived in perfect condition. Beautiful dark and light blue. We love the size of them!! We even use them for small serving bowls. I just hope they don't chip. So far so good
Love these bowls. They are the perfect large sized breakfast or soup bowl. Quality is very good and very sturdy. And they look great !!
"Great quality, bigger than I was expecting, but love them."
The bowls were extremely well packaged. Their sizes were fairly similar. maybe just a tiny difference noted. The finish was slightly different on one of the bowls but not terribly noticeable. All in all a good purchase.
"Not wide enough for Italian pasta but Great for most Soup Supping Italian or otherwise. My Wife pots and she complemented their design, heft, stability and capacity. You can balance the bowls on your lap in bed while watching nightly news slurping Chinese noodle soups. Love them so far. I can't imagine they'll shatter at a hasty clean-up. Sweet, Very Sweet Bowls."
Very Satisficed!
"These are nice bowls, would be perfect for cereal, oatmeal, noodles, soup, etc. But they are 6 1/2 "" wide, so they wouldn't fit in two rows in the cabinet where I wanted them to go. I returned them with no difficulty."
"I like the size ,but find it hard to get soup out of it . Steep sides."
"Great bowls, but package was missing one bowl from the set of 4."
These are not my favorite. A terrible heat and smell comes off of them when microwaved. They have a texture that is funny.
"One of the bowls arrived chipped, unusable."
great addition to our cupboard
"Beautiful bowls, hold a hearty helping of whatever you wish and shipped in a box with fitted foam so no worries about damage!"
"These bowls are so versatile. The quality exceeds what I was expecting. You won’t regret buying these. They’re ideal for salads, pasta, soups, and cereal; both cold as well as hot."
Love the size of these bowls we use them for ramen primarily but also soup and cereal etc. Love the large size makes it easy to fit noodles and veggies and meat all in one bowl!
"These bowls are perfect. They’re beautiful, strong and the perfect portion size."
"These bowls are a fairly good size and deep enough to fit ramen, broth and toppings. They were made well and pretty sturdy, with a beautiful Japanese appeal. Love that it comes in a set of 4, which is perfect for family and/or friends. I've used them not only for ramen, but for other noodle soups, congee and rice and will be storing them in my cabinet for a while!"
"Excellent packaging, there was no way these would have broken in shipment Absolutely awesome bowls. Definitely will order from this vendor again!"
Very durable
"The bowl set is great, and sturdy."
"These bowls came with perfect package. There is no way to break during shipment thanks to their careful packing. The bowls are Japanese style, very sturdy and wider than my expectation. Good fit for ramen, soup, cereal."
"I would have given it 5 stars for the packing alone. I always order dishes and think they’ll arrive chipped or broken. Each bowl was surrounded by soft styrofoam (I’m not sure what it’s called) and then stuck together and tightly packed in its box. I feel like I could drop this off a four story building and it would bounce. The bowls themselves are sturdy, cool looking and deep. I got the 36 ounce bowls and it will easily hold two packs of ramen, and you would not be able to finish your cereal before it got soggy if you filled it. These are by far my favorite bowls. I wish they made matching plates and cups. I’ve ordered so much stuff for my new house and this is one of the few things that didn’t disappoint."
I was impressed by the shipping packaging as it was packaged to prevent any cracking during shipment. These bowls are super cute and worth the price! Love them!
"I've been searching for bowls like the ones I got years ago, these are close, these will work. I was hoping for a little deeper and not as wide but like other reviews, I like the larger portion bowls. Like other reviews there's mistakes in manufacturing, you'd expect to find items like this at TJ Max, because that's what they sell, non perfect items. The defects are in the painting of the bowls where the sprayer missed. Not a huge deal for me, I won't be setting a table with these bowls."
i think i really found the right products for myself and what to easily level up my life experience. my recommendation for you guys also!
"This ceramic bowl is a good choice for salad, pasta, soup and pho. It looks good and has a large capacity. It is worth mentioning that the material of this product is good, because I took the bowl. When the hand will not be scalded by the hot food"
These are really nice and really big bowls. Exactly what I was looking for
terrible falling apart bowls
"These make me so happy. I’ve already got like thirty Glasslock containers but I like these so much better that I’m considering replacing all of them!  The only bummer, and it’s not really a small thing, is the way they are shipped. They ship nested with nice foam between the smaller containers. The biggest bowls have nothing between them, so the inside bowl makes dents and scrapes! It’s an insane oversight. There is no way to get this set without scrapes on the inside bottom of the largest bowl. So yeah, that part sucks. I’m probably going to reach out to Glasslock about it."
I had difficulty sealing/closing the lid. Hand hurts trying to close it. Not happy with the product but I already put it threw the dishwasher so unable to return it.
"This set of Glasslock bowls offers a wide range of sizes that are very useful. The lids have 4 tabs for closing and a silicone rim for a tight seal. They may seem tricky to open and close at first, but they will ease up with use.  The glass is thick and sturdy and not likely to break easily.  You do have to take care to use them properly so you don't damage the bowls or lids. The instruction Use and Care guide has more instructions and cautions than expected. Overall I do love them. I recently moved and somehow misplaced my old mixing bowls. This set is much nicer!  ------------------------------------------------------  From the insert: During the first few uses, it may be difficult to open the lid because of the 100% airtight function. This is not a manufacturer's defect.  Cleaning: Place the glass vessel on the top rack of the dishwasher and use delicate cycle or low cycle to prevent damage. When hand washing, please avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads to preserve the clarity and prevent scratches on your Glasslock.  CAUTION Microwave usage: To use in microwave, please follow the directions in the user manual to avoid breakage. Do not use on direct fire. Do not use microwave on high heat. Do not close lids when heating in the microwave. Do not overload container when using in microwave. Do not directly heat up frozen contents in the container (it may cause breakage) Do not heat up highly oiled contents.  CAUTION: Freezer Safe It is recommended to fill the container up to 80% capacity when freezing. Otherwise breakage may occur if container is frozen when full of liquid."
"Although the name says mixing bowls I utilize this to hold leftover soups, salads, and other foods not finished after meals. These bowls are outstanding. They are simple to clean and unlike plastic they don’t turn colors when holding spaghetti sauces. The lids clamp down and when I turn over the bowls I have not had any leaks. Ive used them multiple times and they are doing great after many times in the dishwasher. They are very durable and I definitely recommend friends and family to get these for themselves."
"This set of Glasslock Mixing Bowl 8pcs set with latching lid is worth every penny!! They are space saving as they fit into one another. The lids snap on easily and are leak proof. I love that they are glass not plastic. You can use them in both the freezer and the microwave. They are dishwasher friendly but only on the top shelf. Also, do not put in the oven. You won't be disappointed with this product."
I really like this set. I love that they’re simple with a nice light color on the lid. All the pieces are stackable so I save a lot of space. I have a few other mixing bowls but they don’t have lids. This is a great way to prep and/or store food. Everything is super durable and sturdy.  Great value!
"Very nice bowls ,easy to use, easy to open/close definitely worthy"
"I had some tupperware containers that I really liked, but with continued use the plastic was getting damaged, scarred and I didn't think it was healthy to continue using them. Found these glass bowls and they are much better to reheat and keep leftovers in than plastic. The locking lids are also my favorite. I think the price is very reasonable. They came well packaged and shipped quickly."
"Just what I was looking for. Perfect size, style and quality."
"These arrived nicely packaged and with cardboard dividers between each bowl. There was no damage. These are nicely sized bowls . . . the size my family prefers. Lately it seems like bowls are either tiny or huge, this is just right. It is slightly taller and narrower than our normal bowls . . . a cone shape more than round . . . but unique. The pattern on the side is attractive and feels good to hold. They have a nice weight and I couldn't find any manufacturing flaws. These aren't a stark white but I wouldn't call them off white either. Sort of a soft white. These are labeled dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer safe but I have only tried them in the microwave and the dishwasher. No problems in either case."
"We have other Getstar sets which we really like. (appetizer plates, dinner plates and pasta bowls) I was hoping these bowls would match a little better but they don’t. I see on Amazon where the matching Getstar cereal bowls are - so be careful if you are ordering and wanted to match up.  We like the Getstar line as we find they don’t scratch and are of good quality at this price point. My only complaint is that I wish there were 6 bowls in their cereal bowl sets, as the plates and pasta bowls all came in boxes of 6."
These Getstar ceramic cereal bowls are our new favorite nightly salad bowls. They are just the right size bowls for a substantial side salad. The bowls have a textured ribbing that makes gripping the bowl easier. I like the flat bottom shape to these and think they look elegant and artistic. Very nice upgrades.
"Nice, quality bowls. They are a perfect portion size, but not large by any means. They have a pretty pattern on the outside and I like the unique shape. I do wish they came in a set of 6 instead of 4."
These bowls are exactly what I wanted and needed. They are very sturdy and deep enough for a good bowl of soup or cereal. They are easy to clean as well. I am very happy with them. I'd order them again.
