"About what you‚Äôd expect for the price. I bought this set for the large 4‚Äù spatula my old 3‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite big enough for smash burgers. I think this was a return item since the box was mangled when I received it, however the spatulas were fine. These are not the heaviest gauge steel, so there is enough flex at the handle that you do need a second tool to help press down the blade for smash burgers. They do seem well built however, and will do the job I bought them for.. I did find the section between the handle and the blade to have edges sharp enough to cut if you slipped while pressing down (something I‚Äôve seen with most other similar tools as well) but it was easy to round it off with 30,seconds work using some 600 grit sandpaper."
Open the Professional Spatula Set and it was immediately apparent on tool examining nation that the large tool handle was deeply cracked through on the front edge. This should not immediately render the tool useless but quality control should be better. Wooden handle on receipt is poor and one can only wonder what the other tools will exhibit after a year or two. Even if the appropriate mineral oil is regularly used on the handles.
"Just got a griddle for camping and needed a spatula that could handle large quantities of food. I‚Äôm using the largest one for the griddle and love that it can easily flip decent size pancakes, bunches of bacon and hash browns with ease. It‚Äôs offset handle keeps your knuckles away from the hot surface and it‚Äôs easy to clean when you‚Äôre done. The smaller ones ( which are still bigger than standard kitchen types) we use with our cast iron skillets."
"these replaced an old, nasty slotted spatula that needed to be replaced years ago. we love the sturdiness, the wooden handles and the ease of turning burgers, pancakes or what ever else needs flipping. we like the choice of sizes."
"Perfect for the grill griddle. Good balance, solid construction, sturdy, and all for a great price. I'd recommend them to anyone who's looking!"
Great product. Very sturdy for the grill.
Exactly as described!
Poor product. Had for alittle over a week used 4 times and the things are rusting on the bottom and pitted.
"My husband‚Äôs review: This spatula set comes with three spatulas of varying size and shape. They've got a very nice heft to them and I cannot wait to smash some hamburger patties with these on the griddle. Two of the three have beveled edges, so you can easily get under pancakes, omelets, hamburger patties (sorry if I seem obsessed here), anything you need to flip. They can also be used to cut, but they're not super sharp, so they won't replace a good knife.  They don't have a full tang through the entire wooden handle, but they also don't seem like they're going to fall apart. I clean them with hot soapy water, so they don't go in the dishwasher, but I'm sure they could. Doing that would likely mess up the wooden handles, so that's why I hand wash them.  They also come with leather loops on the handles, so you can hang them from your grill, provided your grill has hangers for utensils.  Overall, the DflowerK spatulas are a welcome addition to my grilling set and they've been extremely useful thus far. I just need to smash some hamburger patties now."
"This is an excellent set of spatulas for use in every day cooking, whether on the grill, a flat top grill or with cast iron cookware (I don't recommend it for non-stick cookware).  One of my tasks around here is that I make the WHOLE family Breakfast on Saturday mornings. We have a 36 inch flat grill in our main kitchen, which is ideal for when cooking for the herd. Some want pancakes, some want waffles and most of us like eggs with breakfast meats.  The long, round tip spatula makes the job so much easier. I use it to flip bacon, flip pancakes, roll over sausage and of course to flip eggs for over easy or over medium. Just like in a restaurant or diner.  The spatulas also work great on the outdoor grill so that nothing gets stuck on them. Two of the three spats have beveled edges which allow me to easily get under a steak, chicken, vegetables and even fish. I can use two of them at once to pull a whole rack of ribs off the grill and not drop them.  They all have solid wood handles and blades and yet they do not cause any wrist fatigue. The blades are stainless for quick cleanup (don't use a dishwasher or you will ruin the handles) and the spats all have leather straps for hanging.  This is a nice set for the grillmaster or cook in your life.  5 stars and heartily recommended.  JPL"
"This is a professional set of spatulas-the best I‚Äôve ever owned. Two spatulas have sharp beveled edges and one has rounded edges. These are great for the grill. Of course they‚Äôre good for everyday cooking too, but can‚Äôt be used on a lot of my frying pans. These are exceptional quality and should last a long time. Recommended."
The only one my husband uses.
WORKS WELL
Sturdy (metal core?). Seamless so no gunk gets in seams or cracks. Well made. Would buy again.
Sturdy and easy to use. No more stains on the utensils. üëçüòä
"For those with silicone spatula experience, you will know that silicone spatulas can vary greatly in flexibility. Some are not sturdy enough, and some are very stiff, designed more for doughs and very dense batters. These spatulas are perfectly in the middle of the range. They are not at all flimsy. They have a heavyweight core and feel very sturdy/quality. However, the sides of the heads have just enough flex to bend to the shape of whatever bowl or pot you are using. I've been enjoying them for several months now and still have nothing but good things to say. I am always hesitant to purchase this sort of thing without seeing it in person, but in this case, I'm very pleased with the outcome - to boot, they are a great price. Win win!"
Exactly as described.I use the product now for a few weeks. The spatulas have performed perfectly. Very nice clean edge and has been working perfectly with my nonstick cookware.
Perfect set of 3 spatulas with sturdy handles in a variety of sizes.
Just as advertised.
My none stick pots.
"Sturdy, easy to clean"
"Well-made, seems like good quality, good length, good weight, the steel inside gives the spatulas a stiffness which is useful for cooking and stirring but maybe not so efficient when scraping clean the sides of a pot. I like the higher temperature rating for peace of mind but haven't actually tested it for anything over 450 F. I find the handle length is long enough to keep my hand away from the splatter of hot oil or sauce but not so long to be unwieldy when cooking with 7 to 10 inch pots and pans. I mainly use the large spatula for cooking and the small spatula for scooping and spreading things like peanut butter."
Highly recommended; I would definitely buy these again.
"Was not expecting them to be so high quality, do not feel cheap what so ever. Extremely worth the price!"
We bought this because we were in need of a new small spatula. The price was great so we purchased. When received it and used it was blown away from sturdy they were made and how comfortable it was.. this not cheaply made product but a great one!!
Great price for the quality of spatulas and high heat resistance compared to other options. Very sturdy in the handle through the spatula part.
"These spatulas are quite excellent. Much better than the spatula that came with my Cuisinart food processor, which broke under relatively modest pressure. These spatulas seem indestructible, practically. They have a little bit of flex, which make them very effective removing food from containers while presenting no risk of damaging anything. Strongly recommended."
"I am very happy with these. They are solid, like metal, but are covered with a nice silicone material. Very tough but will not harm your non-stick pans or Ninja Cookers."
"This is the first time I have used silicone spatulas in fry pans and pots. They are so easy to use and hold up to everything I have needed them to do. Sturdy, flexible and incredibly easy to clean. I have even used them to flip an omelette."
"I've used them daily for a couple months now. Always clean up easily with no hints of wear. Sturdy, and doesn't melt when left in contact with a hot skillet."
These are our new favorites. I've already tossed the old stuff into the give away pile.
Just what I was looking for.
"Great sizes, flexibility and won't scratch your pans like metal or plastic."
"Seem very sturdy and durable, yet they are flexible enough to do the job. Others I'd purchased were very flimsy at the top."
Great product. Exactly what I was looking for. Old spatulas we leaving particles in food. These are great.
"It is perfect for this baker. one tool to scrape, stir, fold and wash."
Sturdy and great to fold dough etc. Replaces the plastic ones that felt vulnerable with larger volumes of dough (upward from two cups of flour).
The build is solid but the end spatula part isn't sturdy enough and bends.
Nice quality and good sizes.
"Poor design. The steel shank in the handle extends just a few centimeters into the silicone spatula heads, so if you press on the spatula head with any force it immediately begins to cut through. I opened the box, gave them a little test flex, and immediately sent them back."
Spatulas are really practical because you get three different sizes that you can use for different sorts of food and different size pans. Good on nonstick especially ceramic. I was happy to find them.
"These were a few bucks less than a better known brand. Until I got to use them, I was concerned with stiffness or flexibility. They are PERFECT! Super happy w these."
Just what I hoped for.
They were perfect and three great sizes for various use in the kitchen when cooking or even when baking !
I bought them for flipping eggs; they do an excellent job.
"Sturdy, washing well and doesn‚Äôt scratch pans. Great price!"
I like how sturdy these are. Used for baking and I non stick skillet. Pleased with this product.
Very nice design and manufacture
Great spatula! Only Complaint is the handle shafts are to short.
I purchased this set based on the reviews even though it was more money than the others. I thought i would spend a little more and get a better quality but after I had used the longer narrower one a few times I notice my expensive non-stick pan was scratched but couldn't figure out how until I looked on the bottom the the spatula and noticed the metal was exposed on each edge and scratched my pans. The warranty on it is 30 days and i didn't notice this until 3 days after they would take it back. Buyer beware...
Just started to use them and so far so good.
Came quickly very well packaged and well worth the money. Used one to flip burgers last evening Spatula did its job well.
Like the sizes and how sturdy they are.
Handy item
Just as described.
Love it !
I had purchased a silicone spoon spatula many years ago and have loved it and used it up! I'm not sure that the one that I had purchased years ago was heat resistant but I used it trying to get every last little bit out of a hot pan. I definitely have enjoyed it but it was time that I get a new one and so I opted for this set these are so much sturdier than my original and the handle is definitely longer. The short handle had not been an issue with my last one but it will be nice to have that extra length. For the money this is really nice. And I would definitely buy it again
Very good value
"I love these turners as they have just enough flex, don't scrap nonstick pans, easily slide under anything I'm turning. Would have been 5 star if the middle turner were longer."
"Robustesse, qualit√©. Tr√®s satisfaite."
Happy with products...
"My experience with Anmarko has been stellar!!! When my spatula set arrived the mid-sized one was a little loose in the handle, but usable. I wrote to them about what had happened, but didn't ask for a refund or replacement. I just thought they should know. Well, today I received a replacement for that spatula, plus a small one! I'm redoing my kitchen, & I will be ordering more from them!"
"Yes, even though these aren't perfect, I still gave 5 stars. I've had these spatulas for a little over a year. I use the smaller rectangular one almost every day, sometimes multiple times per day. I cook mostly on cast iron. I have used the larger rectangular one very little. In the photos, I tried to show the corners for comparison. The smaller one's corners are just slightly rounded after over a year of use. I have only ever hand washed these; they have never been in the dishwasher. In the photos of the handles, you can see that the smaller rectangular spatula handle has some slight separation, but it doesn't seem to be any looser than it was originally. Both the small rectangular one and the curved end one handles were slightly loose from the day I received them. It bugged me at first, but I am a bit OCD and just learned to live with the imperfection. The large one is rock solid. They are quite rigid, but there is a little bit of flex. They are not full tang handles, the steel ends just past the second rivet. Again, that doesn't seem to affect the quality.  I was completely fed up with the junk utensils from the box stores, and I searched for a quality spatula. I found this set of 3 that have worked great. I only wanted the smaller one, but I've found the other two to be useful at times."
"I can't thoroughly review this yet, as I just got them and washed them, ready to use, but they appear to be of good quality. I got them primarily to use with cast iron, which I am changing over to. They are a big larger than I expected, but should do great. My previous set of spatulas were plastic and about 3 years old and had begun to shred at the edges. I will keep them for pots that I have that cannot stand metal (ceramic coated), but these will be my go-to set."
"These spatulas are well made from thick stainless steel. They are exactly what I was looking for. You can flatten out burgers without them bending. The edges are beveled to allow them to slide under pancakes or burgers, etc. The handles are wooden and riveted to the spatula. There are three sizes to work with all types of food. Best of all, they were not real expensive."
"I was surprised when I received these 3 spatulas. They are so well made. They have a heft to them but not too heavy. Not so light either that you feel that they are made cheaply. Having three different sizes has been so convenient and they ""nest"" with each other so it makes storing them in a drawer a breeze. The spatulas are a perfect match to my homemade hash browns. So easy to flip/turn them over now. I use the spatulas for all other dishes when needed and I couldn't be happier. Not only are these spatulas high quality, they are priced so low for a set. At any other restaurant supply store you'd be paying way more for just one! It's truly a bargain. I have not put these in the dishwasher. All are washed by hand (as most really good kitchen implements should be... especially ones with wooden handles). If you need spatulas I highly recommend this set. I'll be buying more myself to gift to friends and family."
"Cooking on cast iron can requires tools that are able to mechanically separate cooking food from the cookware surface. These spatulas are up to the task, with thick stainless steel, varied widths for different food and cookware sizes, and beveled edges sharp enough to scrape up foods without being dangerous or dulling quickly. The wood handles are a bit bland and don't feel particularly good or bad. The metal is top notch. Highly recommended!"
This spatula set has three sizes. Small which fit in most of my skillets. Medium just as good fits in larger skillets and the large which we use more on the grill. It is great for flipping stuff on the grill. Nice to flip hamburgers and vegetables. These are very easy to wash with soap and water. The handle fix comfortable in my hands.
"This Stainless Steel Spatula Set is the best I've ever tried. really heavy gauge. I have other spatulas, but these really seem to work much better. I mainly got the set because of the rounded front the one has. I thought, my cast ironware is round, a rounded tip spatula should work better. And it does! Also, the thickness is about double of any of my other turners. I would definitely recommend enjoying this set."
"Excellent product, long reach for grilling burgers and other items that need turning. Sharp leading edge for loosening stuck items. Very sturdy with excellent wooden handles. The rounded edge Spatula is great for iron skillet cooking."
"Very sturdy, with well tapered edges. Nice durable handles. I use the large and small spatulas when making smash burgers on my cast iron griddle; the big boy to smash them flat, and tiny to help maintain a uniform thickness. Nice sharp edge sheers the burger of the griddle, maintaining the charred beef surface. Fairly large overall, the smallest of the three is still a large spatula in my experience, your mileage may vary."
I bought this set for my step-son who works as a chef. But I admit that I will be ordering a set for myself as the spatulas are well constructed and made of good material.
I really like these.. have only had a chance to use 2 of them but so far they are great. The balance on them is really good. They are nice and sharp for cutting while you stir or flip. I am sorry I waited so long to get them.
This product is a must have when I go camping for my flat grill. Makes breakfast foods easy and main meals like meat and potatoes easy to fry up. Highly recommend the material quality is impeccable.
"My wife and I enjoy cooking and the Anmarko spatulas are great for a variety of uses, from smashburgers to corralling omelets on the griddle. The largest size is especially good for making rectangular omelets that are easy to flip and fold. The wood handles provide excellent insulation and the blades are easy to clean."
The spatula is well made but the Dynamex delivery person did not followed the delivery instructions. He just dropped the package in the middle walkway of the house. Very exposed to the porch pirates. I gave Dynamex negative star.
"Very happy. I am extremely pleased with the ""heft"" and the varied sizes. The semi-sharpened edges make it excellent for stuck-on food. I use it on cast iron, but I don't use it on no-stick surfaces. I highly recommend."
"Nothing to dislike. This is a nice set of spatulas for the griddle. Been using it mostly for pancakes and gets under them really fast and smooth, and makes flipping them much easier."
"The variable sizes really is a great advantage when doing hibachi cooking on a flat-top grill. The utensils are very sturdy and the handles are the perfect size and angled to protect your hands. I would purchase these again if needed, but I bet they last a long time :-)"
"These are amazing. Typically using the smaller of the three in my kitchen, the other 2 will be perfect for the grill. My only complaint is the handles. Time will tell, not sure what kind of wood they are made of, but they seem sort of sketchy. Will see, the spatula itself is very sturdy."
"I have a gorgeous hand forged brawny steel spatula that my horseshoe made for me 30 years ago. These are the only utensil that comes close! Sturdy and with a quality handle, clean up well, good angle for easy manipulation of food. Wish I'd had this set decades ago!"
"These are exactly what I was after. We don't buy this sort of thing often and over the years managed to destroy all our older spatulas. These are very well made and while a bit overkill for us, perfect for barbecuing on the grill and other heavier jobs. I'm happy with them though."
"Durable, strong and have razor sharp edges! Perfect for chopping, mixing and scraping off a cast iron griddle. Yes well worth the money!  I use these for making smash burgers and other things on my flat top outdoor griddle. They are strong, not flimsy - even though sometimes that is what you need- but an excellent purchase. The handle is a little small for my band but not bothersome."
I have been a Chef for 45 years and these are of the same as we use in the Professional Kitchens.
"Back in the day, I was a short order cook and loved the spatula I used. I had totally forgot about that spatula until I stumbled upon these which are sturdier and the edges sharper than the commercial one I used. I'm really glad I found these."
"I wasn‚Äôt sure about these spatulas at first but when I got them and saw how sturdy they are, well I was impressed. These are very stiff and have sloped edges which make them easy to slide under whatever you are cooking"
"Wife loves them. Bought these after some generic spatula thing bent in the middle of transporting some steaks from griddle to a plate, disaster was narrowly averted, but we don't want to risk it again so I got her some better ones. These are nice, firm, and feel great. Hoping many good years out of them."
I didn't expect there to be so big.. many applications.. I LOVE these.. heavy duty. Looks like they will last a long time. Recommended .. would be good for outdoor grilling.. also has hole in handle for hanging up..
My husband recently bought a flattop griddle and needed better spatulas and we have found them! They are the size and structure he was looking for!
"The long round one is of limited utility in my view, but we've found use for the large size with pancakes and steaks, etc. The small size is excellent and why I bought the set. We've used them for maybe 4 months and have no complaints."
"They are heavy duty, have sharp edges that make turning foods easy."
This product is well worth the money
"These tools are perfect for both indoor and outdoor cooking. The metal plate is solid and works well. the only thing I would improve on is the wooden handle. The wood does not appear to be treated and may weaken after several washes. One option is to treat the wood with waterproofing after the fact. Aside from that, it's a good product."
I bought these to help make Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches. The long and large surface makes it easy to flip. Also you can live your Hibachi dreams with two of them in hand! They have a good weight to them as well.
These spatulas are well balanced and make it easy to manage items in several different cooking applications.
Looking to replace plastic in my kitchen and these are perfect. Good weight and rigidity.
"Nice, durable, not flimsy, just the right size handles!"
we were not able to get spatulas of the size to use on professional grils. the three are everything you stated and more they have the cutting edge to use in chopping up ground beef and sausage. they were used the day they arrived and everyday since.
In retrospect I only needed the small one as the other two are fairly large for most pans or skillets.
they are easy to clean and use.
"The three sides of this spatula are tapered to allow you to get under your food, or scrape burnt pieces off the surface. In addition, they are nice and hefty. spjatula runs into handle."
"I have been wanting a good turner for a long time, you just can't find them in stores. I am very pleased to own a professional turner so I can make perfect over easy eggs and large omelets, without tearing them up trying to get under them."
Good value
Bought these for my husband for Christmas to replace one that we had where the handle cracked. For the price of 1 replacement I got 3!!! The different sizes have been very helpful. Note the small one has sharp edges so be aware where you place in your drawer lol!
"No need to buy anything else. These are what you are looking for, unless of course, you need something for non stick."
These are great especially for the griddle.
"I bought this along with a cast iron patty press. These spatulas look and work great. I use them to flips burgers, and butter my buns."
I have used this set since I bought it and it works great. I am very pleased with my purchase!e
I bought these as a birthday gift for my husband. I received them very quickly and in great condition. My husband is very happy with them. They are good quality and look like they will last a long time.
i like
"Multiple sizes, easy use and clean."
It's nice but again it's a spatula. I don't get that excited... Maybe later in life
We really get a lot of use out of these! We have a Traeger which usually has multiple items cooking.
They work well with my cast iron skillets. I believe they would be good on a griddle also.
"I got tired of my spatulas bending and breaking. The stuff you buy in the supermarket is junk. These are made to last a lifetime. Buy them, you won't be sorry!"
"I finally picked these up, and I have to admit they are everything they state to be. I used them on the grill, and for making all sorts of breakfast on a griddle. They do not disappoint. Highly recommend to anyone considering a simple solution for a variety of cooking applications."
"Grate to gift to anyone who loves to cook, last long great material"
Sturdy and easy to clean. Nice handles. For residential use may I suggest only packaging the 2 small sizes only. Thank you
"I bought this set along with a George Foreman grill as a wedding gift. I was pleased with the looks, quality and the fact the handles are wood, instead of plastic. I‚Äôm sure the recipient will be very pleased."
If you are a chef you need these spatulas because they are easy to handle.
"I like to have a selection when cooking, whether it's grilling or on the flat top. The 3 new spatulas are very good quality. Thanks and I know I will get years of use from them."
"Excellent quality, as I had hoped for. The two sharp corner utensils are definitely sharp at that. Can chop right through cooked hash browns or veggies on the flat top with ease. Super sturdy, comfortable wood handle grips. Recommend to anyone!"
Nice set.
"Great, professional spatulas"
I like the balance of these and the angles of the scooping surface work great on our griddle
Love these for use on my blackstone griddle!
Built like a tank. should last forever
I would buy again. As advertised.
These were bought for a present so I didn‚Äôt actually use them but they appear to be made from very nice quality materials. And the sizes give a nice variety. I did end up ordering a pancake turner from another manufacturer so there would be one that was more flexible since these are quite rigid.
"If you need large spatulas, these are great. Nice and heavy. Worth the money. I added an extra coat of vegetable oil to the wooden handles, something that should be done frequently, epecially if washed in a dishwasher."
They are good quality & work well.
"This is simply bait & switch. Both the photos from the current description and past reviews show the metal as one piece with a plastic handle. What arrived is cheaply joined between the base of the metal spoons/turner/skimmer/fork and the metal stem, then the plastic handle. These aren't going to hold up, and they don't look good. Please see the photos and don't waste your time with this set."
I purchased cast iron pans recently and needed something to use in them. All I had was plastic turners and they don't work well in cast iron and can sometimes melt a bit in them. This turner is nice and lightweight and is thin enough to turn your food without tearing it up. It scrapes the pans nicely when food sticks a bit and it has held up well. I have not noticed any chipping or wearing from cooking. I will be buying a few more of these since one just isn't enough.
"I needed a ladle for a vacation home and in the past only had ladles with more of a scooped, half sphere shape. But I purchased this anyway and it's performing much better than I expected. The more flat bottomed shape is very convenient, especially retrieving vegetables and other ingredients in soups more easily than the traditionally shaped ladles I've always used in the past. It's made well and a good size for regular kitchen use. The handle may be a bit short if you're doing institutional cooking in a very deep pot, but I don't think that's its intended use."
I needed a stainless steel flat edged spatula to use on a new cast iron pan for my daughter who just got the pan and had no steel spatula. This was a great price so I ordered it. I was at her house when it was delivered. It is well made and sturdy enough to work well with the cast iron pan.  I then visited another daughter who just received a stainless steel frying pan and had no flat edged steel spatula. Of course I ordered her one of these too. Perfect for the pan--great to cook with and perfect to scrap the bottom to remove food particles both in cooking and in cleaning.  I am keeping the link so when my own stainless steel spatula wears out I can replace it with this one. I cannot imagine cooking in my cast iron and stainless steel frying pans without a good flat edged stainless steel spatula. And this one is perfect. It is sturdy but not heavy but I don't abuse them enough to need one that can take a beating--just one that can do the job. And this one is perfect.
"I cook with stainless steel pans and need a stainless steel spatula not just to flip things over, but to scrape the browned parts off the bottom of the pan -- plastic ain't gonna do it. The crazy thing is, 99% of spatulas out there have a rounded front instead of a flat front, which makes scraping take a lot longer (less contact).  The good news: there are 2 spatulas in existence on Amazon that are stainless steel with a flat front:"
"Just exactly what I wanted / needed. The blade is thin enough to slide easily under delicate food. And the turner is very well made indeed, I see little that is likely to fail. There is no weld point between the blade and the handle, the most likely point of failure. That's what did in my last one."
I love it! I received this the first week of March 2020 and have been using it dailey to cook with in my iron skillets. It works wonderfully for getting under all items to flip them as well as scraping the fond tidbits from the pan when I want to deglaze it with meats that are cooked. Truly perfect with it‚Äôs straight edge tip for steaks and chicken breast. It‚Äôs sturdy and dishwasher safe. No rust or pitting. Or flimsy bowing. I can‚Äôt believe it was just a little under $5 for the quality that it‚Äôs made of. Very happy with my new spatula!
"So, what can you say about a simple spatula? Well, quite a bit !! I've been looking far and wide for an ""old Fashioned"" spatula for some time ... couldn't find one anywhere ?? My favorite Spatula (one of the signs of old age) is wearing out, beginning to crack long where the rivets are ... the thin stainless steel, combined with a square leading edge, fits the bill perfectly !!! I bought 4 of these and passed them out to some of my friends with similar laments .... Thank You !!!"
"I am switching to Cast iron pan, skillets and griddles and noticed that silicon/nylon spatulas/turners were not going very well with them. Got this one as trial and man this cheap priced item is Perfecto!!! Light, comfortable with grip, and does great job scraping from cast iron pans bottom which nylon spatulas can't do. It's arm is not too long so it sits perfect in my 8"" frying pan. Couldn't ask for more."
I don't know why I love this ladle so much except to say that I DO. It's sturdy and great at scooping thick soups into bowls and it makes me quite happy!
"I'm a fan of stainless steel cookware instead of non-stick, and I make fried tofu on a near-daily basis. If the oil isn't hot enough, it will stick, but this is great at freeing it without messing it up! My favorite aspect of this turner is that the front is flat across instead of being slightly curved, and it is also not so sharp that grabs or chatters along the bottom of the pan as it slides.  Update April, 2017: This is still my favorite turner for use with metal pans. It's also great for making fried eggs!"
"I got this specifically to clean my cast iron skillet. I normally use nylon or silicone spatulas, the only other steel spatula is a grill one with an extra long handle, so needed a shorter model that could be put to hard, non-intended use.  It's fit the bill so far, very little flex which is a plus, and inexpensive. My wife has used it while frying donuts, and gave it a thumbs up for traditional usage as well."
"Recently I started cooking in cast iron. Occasionally, something sticks to the bottom (I'm still learning) and I needed a more sturdy spatula than the ones I'd been using on the non stick pans. When something sticks in the cast iron pots, after removing the contents, I'd add some water and stick the pot back on the stove to boil loose the stuck bits, but found I still needed a helper every once in a while. This one was just right! I also use it on the outside griddle. It's great for scrapping the grill plate after taking up the food."
"Thin enough to get under the fragile-est of pancakes, yet sturdy enough to flip a steak. Lightweight and durable. The handle is not too bulky either (my old spatula had a super thick handle and it didn't fit in my utensil holder). this one is great!"
"Got this because my plastic spatula just wasn't hard enough for my cast-iron pan, which is my primary cooking pan. It gets so hot that the plastic spatula melted a bit. So I went and grabbed this metal guy, and the DIFFERENCE asldkgajsdg. I use this fella to scrape the pan out at the end of cooking too and he does a great job--better than the purpose-made pan scrapers I own, in fact! Absolutely essential kitchen tool in my armoury, more than a bargain for the price I paid. He feels real sturdy, not flimsy at all, and the plastic handle hasn't melted like my plastic spatula's handle did!"
"I never thought I would be writing a review about a Spoon; however, I have to admit, this is one great spoon!  It's very easy to hold and scoops a fair amount. It is sturdy and very easy to clean. After dealing with flimsy, bendable spoons for years, this one really raises the bar!  Highly recommended, especially for anyone who often makes large pots of food, from soups and stews to canned goods!"
"Ya know when you have something, like a thick, old, plastic spatula, and it makes you crazy because it is so thick that it bunches up anything you are trying to use it on? Well, after years of that, I ordered these spatulas, and they are so wonderful! They are pretty heavy duty but still thin enough to slide right under things, and they work great. Who knew a spatula would even matter in my life, but apparently it does! If you have spatula issues, these are a great problem solver."
More of a food pusher than a food turner. Can't get under the food without holding it because the blade is too thick/not tapered at the edges. Maybe okay for grill. Used it once and put it in the garbage instead of the dishwasher.
"Most spatulas these days are either too big (made for barbecue), too bendy (plastic), or the blade is too thick. This is the closest I've come to getting that replacement for the one we all had 15-20 years ago.  Is it a perfect replica? No. But it's close enough that I'm giving it 5 stars. If for no other reason than the fact that the maker was at least aware of the issue."
I‚Äôve had this ladle for a little over three months and I use it about once a week. I‚Äôve loved it up until this point. But tonight will doing the dishes I realized it has a crack in the side. How does something like this even happen? It mean it‚Äôs stainless steel‚Ä¶ Right? I have never seen a stainless steel spoon cracked like this. Ever. It‚Äôs so strange. I am so disappointed. Next time I will buy a sturdier spoon. :(
"I do a lot of cooking and I took a chance on this one, knowing the ladle is an odd shape. Well, it turns out the configuration is just perfect. Couldn't be more cleverly designed. The shape makes it very easy to ladle out the last drops of liquid. Having used this ladle for about a year, I can say this is one great kitchen utensil!"
"It is not ""heavy"" but it is strong enough for stirring and ladling anything that it would be used for. What I LOVE about it is the shape of the scoop! It is much more efficient at getting soup and stew out of the bottom of pots than any I have ever seen before. Just don't try using it for prying nails out of boards, or something like that, and it is heavy enough."
"The edge on the spatula front is not an edge. It is a thick rounded end that is useless and does not get under anything--a pancake, for example."
"Bought this and stainless steel scrubbers for my mother so she can start cooking with her stainless steel pans. We have been doing so for years and explained how to do did it (heat pan first, add cooking spray or oil, then food). Most times, nothing sticks, but whatever residue does, can be scrubbed off with the scrubbers. My mother is extremely happy with her pans now. The right tools make all the difference!"
"I bought this as a Christmas present for someone a d ended up keeping it. I use cast iron skillets to cook with and needed something a little sturdier than the hard plastic spatulas I have had. This is sturdy, fairly lightweight, and user friendly. Cleaning is easy and best part is that I don‚Äôt have to worry about melt spots on it."
"This ""turner"" looks nice and feels nice. I have another one that I've had for years and love. This one is very much like it, so I'm happy! I have others made out of the material to use on Teflon or non-stick pans, but they really don't work well, especially for turning fried eggs and I don't like to use them unless my stainless turner is in the dishwasher. Now I have two that I like! As long as this one doesn't rust, I'll be a ""happy camper""!!"
"This ladle is exactly as described, solidly made and comfortable in my hand. The oblong shape is so much more sensible than the round ladle as it's much easier to get exactly what you want from the pot. Great product!"
After 40 + years with my old spatula it finally broke. It was a sad day. I thought I'd have it until the day I died. But I was a little too rough and broke the handle off . This new spatula is a little more upscale and I'm sure when I die this spatula will live on.
"Great spatula. I needed a metal spatula for my new cast iron pan. this one has a great, crisp edge to it. Although its not completely squared up, there is a very slight angle to the scraping edge. It did not affect the performance of the turner.  The handle is very sturdy and feels like it should have cost more $.  Will probably buy a second one, as we use it every day and get sick of washing over and over:)"
So far the product seems to be doing good and we are a month into it I'll come back when I have more details on how I bent it or what I did to it to make it any different
"What can I say, they're spatulas. They are pretty rigid, don't bend easily, so I don't have to worry about my burgers springing up and hitting the ceiling when I'm cooking on my cast iron skillet. They work good for helping the freezer defrost along as well. Nice grippy handles, no problems so far. Would buy again if needed."
"Got tired of dealing with spatulas made especially for teflon pans. The edge is usually thicker and make for a more difficult turning of some foods. Gave up my teflon pans, moved back to cast iron skillets that really are more heat efficient. This metal spatula is a plus."
"We bought this item to use with our stainless steel pots and pans. This ""Turner"" appears to be a very good durable design. The stainless steal shaft and blade is very sturdy at the place where most other spatulas break into . The shaft and the handle seem to be joined together very well. Looking forward to having many trouble free years of regular use. Highly recommend this item."
"I wanted a spatula that was sturdy and would hold up for my cast iron skillet. This fits the bill perfectly. It is strong, just the right size and a good value over higher priced spatulas that offer no more options."
"This is my second purchase of this spatula. First one is still in use, I just got this so my wife would have a second one readily available. She uses this exclusively in her iron skillets."
"Besides ladling out soup it works as a drumstick to smack, pots, pans and the whiney adult person demanding that you hurry up with dinner."
"It is thin enough to get under the food easily without tearing it apart or losing part of it, my main reason for ordering it. It is easy to clean and does not stain like the non-metal ones. The front age can also be used for gently cutting and separating foods and won't melt to the bottom of the pan, I can leave it in while cooking. I bought this to replace a nonmetal spatula and I am very happy with it."
"Works great! I got tired of my flimsy plastic spatulas, so I got this. I love it. It's super sturdy, easily can go under food to flip them. Easy to clean."
When I first opened I thought it was going to be hard to clean & flimsy. I was WRONG. Very Easy to clean & Sturdy. Very HAPPY with this purchase.
This is a nice looking stainless steel spatula that is sturdy enough to flip food and scrape off cooked on food bits.
These metal spatulas last a long time. My previous metal spatula actually still works after 40 years but is finally showing some signs of wear so I got this one. It is just as sturdy and I expect it will last the rest of my life.
"Got this to replace a pair of silicone-tipped tongs that I couldn't get the soap taste out of. Have used this spoon many times. It really works well. Does everything I need a cooking spoon to do and easy to clean. Still, wonder how it will hold up over time. I would suggest hand-washing just because of the plastic handle, which feels like the kind of stuff that might melt or crack if your dishwasher gets really hot during drying. I haven't tried doing that."
"I really like this turner, it is firm and does not wimp out on heavier lifts. Usually hand wash but habe run it in the dishwasher a few times too. Holding up nicely. I would recommend this turner!"
"I've only used it a few times, but it's exactly what I wanted. The weight is substantial enough, yet not uncomfortable to use. The turner has a little bit of give, but it's not flimsy. A small depression for your thumb helps with the grip. The overall look, feel, and use are that this item is of good quality."
This is a very nice ladle and I use it to poach eggs in. Pop an egg in it and just hold it in boiling water for a minute and I have a perfect poached egg. Hardly any clean up.
We are swapping plastic utensils out of our kitchen and this set helped us cover many of the ones we use the most. We have used them with a variety of dishes since we got them. They all have worked well. We really like the spatula and the dipper.
"I bought this because of price and needed a new spatula, turns out better than expected, I saw almost the same spatula at the grocery store for $11, so if you are looking for a nice steel spatula, this is it!!"
Love the flat edge. Brilliant! Finally a ladle you can scrape the bottom with!
I had a specific metal spatula I was looking for and this was it. I wanted one that was not too thick so I could fry eggs or flip pancakes easier but my husband wanted one for grilling burgers. We use it all the time!
"Bought to replace a very old piece. This is has a good sized, thin, ""shovel"". While a few reviews mentioned a flimsy handle, I find it sturdy enough for steaks and burgers on the grill."
"What can one say about a spatula? For the price, I would love to have had a spatula of this quality years ago. I would have saved so many purchases of new ones at (perhaps) slightly lower prices. This one is a life-time purchase. Highly recommended!"
"Very durable, works fantastic, made to last a lifetime, attractive, and is perfect."
I bought this spatula to use when we use our cast iron fry pan. It is easier to use because it's thinner than the plastic spatulas. Only downside is it can not be used in nonstick cookware. The price was great!
"A slim metal spatula, thin enough to flip delicate crepes and sturdy enough to deal with a heavy piece of anything else. Pure function, easy to clean and very affordable (that's always a nice thing).  Not the most glam thing in the kitchen, but it works. It works SO beautifully."
Se had all kinds of plastic spatulas and large grill ones. This was the answer to our dreams of a small manageable spatula the works with every pot. Cant beat the price either.
"These pancake turners are a very nice, heavy weight stainless steel. Edges are nicely finished, no sharp edges. High quality."
"My other metal spatulas had become chipped and were scratching my metal cooking sheets and aluminum skillet. I got this one because the picture looked nice and the price was right. This metal spatula does exactly what I need it to do. It's not as thin as my old ones so, I am hoping that it holds up for a long time."
"Its remarkable how taken my spouse and I are with this simple product, but its well designed and better than several competitor products we've tried. It has our endorsement."
"The old turner I had just fell apart. Since I cook quite a bit and my daughter wants to be a chef, I have been much more dilligent about purchasing quality kitchen tools. I have used it for over 2 months and it has been in the dishwasher several times. Absolutely no complaints. I would purchase from this seller again."
"This sturdy flipper is great for flipping hamburgers, pancakes, anything you need to flip in your frying pan it's lightweight. I definitely recommend it washes great in the dishwasher or by hand!"
Love my little beast of a spatula. I needed a thin spatula for cookies and picking up delicate food products. This little sturdy beast fits the bill.
It is a longer spatula that is good to use to flip pancakes and such! Not real rigid but works well. Went through the dishwasher just fine!
"Perfect shape, size and handle length. Well constructed and a solid buy."
"It's the perfect egg flipper! It's also easy to clean,too. Thank you!"
"We barbecue whenever we can, so it's nice to have an adequate number of spatulas around. This one is economical, sturdy, and seems to hold up just fine in the dishwasher."
"I use this every time I barbecue, and it works well. It's sturdy and cleans easy. Definitely recommend."
"Love this spatula! It‚Äôs super strong. Not sure why all the bad reviews, maybe in there fixing a car with it. Who knows.. the spatula is a great buy."
"Sturdy, easy to hold, I would reorder if I needed another!"
DOES EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED IT FOR WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK.  NO bells or whistles necessary SO none included.
Mothers day gift and she loves it!
"Before receiving this spatula life was dull, grim, and overall lacking purpose. The package arrived early and the bubble wrap was superb. Upon opening the envelope my eyes lit up - this was clearly ‚Äúthe One‚Äù. I can honestly say this spatula has changed my life for the better. Not only are my omelets coming out more refined and undoubtedly enhanced, but I‚Äôve overall been more inspired to be a better person. One of character, fortitude, and grandiosity. Thank you spatula, For making me a kinder, happier, and - dare I say - more spiritual, individual. Jakob"
"While this turner is quite sturdy, it's not as heat resistant as described. I used this less than 10 times on things like frying eggs or fish or stir fry, and already the coating at the edges has come off. Seems to melt. I rarely write bad reviews, however, I feel like the manufacturer really need to change the description on this product, because, the main feature I wanted from this was, heat resistance leading to durability. Unfortunately, this product does not seem to live up to it. Really disappointed."
"The spatula is exceptionally well balanced. That was the first thought that poppec into my head when I picked it up from its delivery box. It felt really good in my hand. And this is not the comment of someone just trying to sell the product, I‚Äôm an actual purchaser and user. To take this a step further, the cost of one labeled black2 was on sale, I purchased a second one the next day. Well balanced. OK just a joke but I wanted to prove a point. I wanted to cook something else just so I could use a spatula again. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ In other words, this is the best flipper I have ever owned. Would I buy it again, I already have."
"As always, Kitchen Aid has produced another success with this product. This pancake turner (or simply, ‚Äúturner‚Äù) is sturdy, crafted from material that will not scratch enamel-coated non-stick pans and withstands a good deal of heat. I do not know the exact level of heart that this turner will withstand because I‚Äôve not tested it; I didn‚Äôt want to destroy it. However, I‚Äôve used it to scrambled eggs and perform other tasks on the stovetop at high heat, and it performed well without curling or peeling. I should think that unless one held it directly in the fire of a gas range that it should be fine. I would highly recommend this product because of its durability and ease of cleaning."
I prefer egg/hamburger turners that are of a stiffer quality. Most are flimsy and the food that is being cooked slides off before I'm ready. This one is just right. The only complaint I have is that the handle is too long. The last one I had was a little shorter and was easier to use. I will make it work until I find a handle that is a bit shorter.
We own a lot of silicone spatulas but they do not do the same job as a plastic one. We bought two of these. They are great. They‚Äôre sturdy and easy to clean. They‚Äôre not too big or too small. The leverage from the handle is perfect. These are my favorite spatulas!
"Bought this for my husband, who does not like spatulas that break easily. This is very sturdy. Hoping it will last a while. So far, it is easy to clean, and there are no pieces coming off the end, which was another issue we had with others. Will update review if any issues in future."
"I've had quite a few spatulas in my life. I ran restaurants for some years. At home though, everything is non-stick needing plastic tools. Some of them are good, others look like the guy who designed them was drunk. This spatula falls into the very good range. Nice weight, good balance and the blade is at the proper angle for working."
"We own another Kitchen Aid spatula and it has lasted well compared to cheap brands that melt and flake quickly when used. This one is nicely made, have used it, and like it well. No issues with use or cleaning.... The only disadvantage is that it can't hang on a utensil hook...no hole in the handle. Since this brand lasts, it's not a big issue finding a different way of putting it away. I would buy it again."
"I mean wow! I thought my life was over when I broke my Spatula City spatula. I will miss Spatula City, it was the best store. Then here comes KitchenAid with a god tier spatula that has changed the spatula game for all time. One you have used this spatula, there is no going back. If you don't buy this spatula you will regret it."
"Had a nice scratch free unit that drove me nuts trying to clean it, had to use scratchy pads and scrapers. This one is a dream, works great, no heat damage and easy to clean . Best one I have had. Not to speak of a good price."
"KitchenAid makes a good product line, but I was not expecting this spatula to be quite so sturdy. It will be lovingly known as the Spatula From Hell in my kitchen, and I'm sure it will outlast me and at least one future generation."
Nice egg Turner. Purchased a Bella electric skillet that does not permit a metal egg Turner. Picked this plastic unit up at same time. Works well and is much sturdier that other flimsy plastic egg Turner I have used. Good price for a Kitchen Aid product.
A quality product that easily slips under the eggs and allows you to gently turn them over. Works well with any type of cookware surface or grill without scratching it.
"Solid little spatula, easy to clean and able to withstand some pressure. It‚Äôs not as wide as some but has a little more strength for lifting, and cutting and freeing stuff from the side of a pan, like lasagna or a casserole."
Need a fry turner. This one feels properly heavy and sturdy (in contrast to those thin and soft). So far so good. Recommended.
"This turner is wide enough to use on fried eggs, long enough to keep you away from the heat, and designed to provide a comfortable grip and wrist posture. Will not scratch non-stick pans, yet its edge is sharp enough to scrape up sticky or burned foodstuff."
"My previous spatulas had broken, melted or disappeared. This one is great for all my cooking purposes. Very, very sturdy, and dishwasher safe"
I always liked kitchenaide products. This is a good quality utensil in my opinion. It is sturdy and has a little weight to it. Unlike the ones sold in discount and dollar stores.
"This is sturdy, doesn‚Äôt melt with high temperatures and is easy to clean and I love that it is a good length and a good sturdy large surface to pick up an egg without breaking the yoke!!"
But a darn good one! This was the first piece of this collection that I purchased. It was so good that I purchased the rest.
"This spatula is extremely sturdy and stiff. So if you‚Äôre looking for a spatula that has a little bend to it, this is not the one for you. Works great for heavier foods and when you have to scrape at something."
This item was purchased as a gift. Well received.
Sturdy turner. Doesn't bend like so many cheaper ones.
"Just as I expected. Haven't used very much yet but it should work out fine for my purposes. Pretty large in size. Would be great for outside grill. I would have preferred the handle just a little less large for my stovetop use, but that is just my preference. Others may like it just the way it is. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
High quality and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. I highly recommend.
"The spatula is sturdy, easy to use and clean. id highly recommend"
This kitchen tool is the perfect size and washes easily.
Heat resistant and attractive. Well built and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. What more can you ask for?
Study handle so picking up is a breeze and the handle is long enough to keep away from the heat. Nice product.
"Great heat resistance, very sturdy and easy to clean"
Easy use Large face
"Good quality, perfect length."
"Well made and easy to use/clean, just slightly bigger than I thought."
"sturdy, heat resistant, easy to clean, flips well"
"Nice and solid. Replaced an older flimsy one, should have done that a long time ago. Will never go back to cheap ones after this."
This is a perfect spatula!
Bought this to replace my spatulas of 20 years. It is nice and sturdy and easy to clean!
I was surprised how heavy this thing is. Feels very sturdy and well-built. Works great with my non-stick pans when I need a stiff spatula
Just what I needed. Sturdy and stiff enough so I can flip over easy sggs perfectly. Great kitchen utencil.
Have used it for awhile now and have no complaints! Very sturdy and well made! Feels good in the hand!
Very sturdy... My other one seems so flimsy now next to it. Good buy
I like the size and ease to hold onto with the large handle.
Very well weighted. Seems very sturdy. Great purchase. Would buy again.
"No surprises, just a good sturdy spatula. Would recommend."
It's sturdiness is its best feature.
Good quality
I LOVE THIS ! ITS BIG TOO !
"Great quality, I‚Äôve used it to make eggs & grill burgers"
Love it !! Perfect for my husbands use!!!!!
Fine - should stand up better than the old one I had
"Very nice, very sturdy. At the same time light enough to use."
Exactly what I expected it to be. Very happy.
Heat resistant and very easy to use
Good and sturdy product I really like this.
Feels very nice and study. Pretty easy to clean and it came well packaged. My partner is very happy with it :)
Its sturdy and heat resistant
"Works well in the kitchen. Even with sustained use, it remains easy to clean (both with hands and dishwasher) and resists heat well. 10/10"
Liked long handle.
"It's incomprehensible to me how a product was rendered completely unusable on day 1 after I used it exactly as intended. The manufacturers must have never tested it on basic use cases. How can such a reputable company sell a tool that melts almost instantly in pans on medium heat?  The very first time I used this spatula/turner, I was frying pancakes on medium heat with a nonstick pan on a glass stovetop. I did not leave the turner sitting in the pan. I only touched it to the pan briefly while checking the bottoms of the pancakes and flipping them.  Nevertheless, the part at the tip already melted and re-hardened. When I touch that part with my fingers now, tiny black bits of material break off the melted end. I'm afraid some of these got into the pancakes accidentally.  I'll be buying a new silicone spatula/turner instead and using that in the future."
I expected a spatula and I got one!
As described very sturdy
Very sturdy
Good
Was a gift
"Sturdy, well-made, will stand up to the eggs that dare try to stick to the pain."
Works
It‚Äôs a bit too long
Works great no problems.
Great utensil! Flips eggs with ease.
"Handles fill up with dirty water when you wash them. Even after drying and sitting for a couple of days, smelly water drips out of the handle into the food you are cooking. Gross... This is NOT a sanitary product."
"When you wash these spatulas, water gets stuck from the space where the silicone meets the metal; water leaks from the space when you use them to cook with."
I like having extra spatulas for removing food off pans and stuff from the oven and these work great for that. they work well for cooking too. They don't replace my metal spatula though (which I use to cut pizza and such). I liked the thinner handles of these cause it makes it easier to fit them in my utensil holder and the color matched my d√©cor.
"I absolutely love these spatulas! They are exactly what I was looking for. They're sturdy silicone, heat resistant, easy clean-up, and come in some nice colors. I can use these on my non-stick pans and not worry about scraping my pans. The only very minor drawback is that dried water shows exceptionally well on the blue colored spatulas."
"I purchased the ladles first and came back for the spatulas! Love Love Love Flexible but not floppy, great sturdy handle and fits your hand very well. I would highly recommend these as gifts too! Every kitchen needs these spatulas!"
These are far superior to anything I have gotten in a department store. The very ends are a little bit flexible (to get under things) but the rest of the item is strong and perfect. I was afraid it would be flimsy but it's not.
"This silicon set was just what I was looking for. Love the color, easy to clean, nice and sturdy. Happy I bought them."
Good quality/well made/great value for the cost.
These are great. Love them.
I really love the feel of these! I will buy again
"I bought some new Kirkland Cookware and did not want to use metal turners in my new skillets, so I ordered these because I thought the price was reasonable. I have used both the slotted and solid and they have worked well. The edge is a little thick for getting under some things, but I have had that issue with other silicone turners I have owned. In looking at the reviews before I bought these I noticed some people complained about water getting into the handles and then dripping into the food when they used them. I have not had that issue, but I do not soak them in dishwater. I either wash them immediately or put them in the dishwasher, so I can't be sure if soaking created this issue for others."
I absolutely love these!!! They don't bend and are very sturdy!!!
"I have a tendency to overcook (and sometimes burn) food! These utensils are perfect for me, because the ends of the spatulas are not permanently scorched."
"I always wanted a spa, I thought thats what this was. It wasn't, its a cooking tool! Who knew. It worked out well though because I needed a new one. Good value"
Sturdy and easy to clean. A bit too slippery for eggs unless you‚Äôre really careful.
Bought this as a gift and the recipient really likes it. It gets the job done and doesn‚Äôt look cheap like some other products I‚Äôve seen. Good buy
"Very easy to clean, feels well built and very sturdy."
"These are very well made, reasonably priced, easy to clean. Sturdy. Love them!!"
I am throwing out ALL of my old spatulas -- these are the BEST that I have ever purchased. You can't go wrong with these.
"I like the sturdy, yet flexible silicone, but was disappointed in the color. I expected turquoise blue like the ones pictured, but instead they are more of a blue-gray color. I really wanted the color pictured, so was let down by that, but they do seem to be a good turner overall. I haven't used them yet however. I do like the soft grip handle, and soft turner area so it won't scratch my pans."
I took a chance on these because of the price. I‚Äôm really happy I did. Both spatulas are really well made and have a nice heaviness/sturdiness I will buy this set again
"Perfect! Finally found aa good combo that doesn't stain, rust, peel or hold water. Strong and no bend."
Works great...enough said
Love these. They look great and are so nice to cook with. I highly recommend.
Just what I was looking for very nice and sturdy and easy to clean
Easy to clean and are sturdy and can take the heat
spatulas work really well and good deal for the price.
"High quality, great price."
This spatula was very sturdy to use and super easy to clean.
Well worth the price would buy them again in a heartbeat
Too early to tell but is fine.
Great kitchen tools. Fits well into our utensil organizer.
"These silicone turners are great. Very sturdy, easy to clean, and good dexterity. Would definitely purchase these again in the future when we need more!"
Very Sturdy turners!!! These were purchased to replace old ones - these were shipped out the next day!!
"I love these spatulas! They are the perfect size, very sturdy and have a nice weight when I use them!"
I like that it is sturdy even though is silicone.
"Great product, very sturdy and clean up well. Very heat resistant."
"They are great, handy, reliable and do the job! 10/10 recommend"
"They are sturdy silicone spatulas, but they are too thick to get under whatever needs to be flipped. No matter what I've tried to use the for (eggs, pancakes, burgers, grilled cheese, etc.) I can't slide it underneath. That makes these pretty useless."
"Sturdy, well made and easy to clean."
This is perfect on non stick cookware!
"While well constructed, the tip is too thick, the rake angle (look it up) too great for the blade to get under the food to lift or flip. I may grind down the tip to keep my easy overs from becoming scrambled."
Awesome! I would definitely buy again.
It's a little difficult to get under eggs or pancakes to flip them over. They are sturdy and the design is nice.
"Very happy with these so far!! Wish they made them in half the size, I use smaller pans for cooking and it's a bit awkward to use. Love the color and durability."
"I really like these spatulas, however, I wish they were a bit thinner at the end to make getting under an egg or pancake in order to flip it easier. Great otherwise."
They do the job but not the best to flip pancakes. The lip of the turner is a little too thick making it more difficult to flip.
"Still need to be cook with them, but they arrived in good condition and look very sturdy."
"They run a bit on the small side, but they are very heat resistant and work quite well."
This 2 piece spatula set is great. The blue color matches my kitchen. Works great in the frying pan
They are bigger than I expected.
"I bought these spatulas for my nonstick pans and they work great! The only reason I took away a star is because I ordered the rose gold ones and the silicone part in the pictures looked pinkish, but when I got them, they‚Äôre actually gray which was slightly disappointing. Other than that, they‚Äôre good and what I was looking for!"
"It‚Äôs a spatula and does spatula things very well, unless my husband is cooking but that is most likely user error."
I have only used the spatula a few times and it has already cracked on one corner. Very disappointed! I really liked the spatula before I noticed the crack.
Bought it in December and it is already chipped. Only used to flip pancakes or fish.
Great length and very sturdy
Handles are a bit too long.
Great product
""
So far this set is working out wonderfully!
Too bulky to use for flipping eggs or the like. It can flip thick items but not what you want for everyday use.
Well worth it!!! Durable and affordable
Kinda pricey but there okay.
Good product
Made food removal easy. The blue spatula was easier to get under the food.
I really wanted to love this set of spatulas but after using the solid one less than a handful of times it chipped along the edge. They feel nice and study and seemed like an upgrade from my last set until this happened.
Great for scrambled eggs
"This product, imm0d!um ‚Ç¨aps, 2oo c0unt is h@lf pr!‚Ç¨e on the!r web$!te."
Too thick make it hard to flip eggs. Could be good for something‚Äôs but they are too big and clunky for me.
Made cheap in my opinion flipping pancakes broke it just with a few uses. If it was solid all the way through with the metal just being decretive it would be a good spatula.
"These are thicker where the handle inserts, seem to be better quality than most of the cheap silicone spatula/turners I've seen or purchased. I have another, where you can see that the handle is very near the surface of the spatula. I expect that won't last too long. These look like they will hold up."
Very happy with the quality and design. They worked even better than I had hoped for.
"These spatulas are good quality and work perfectly, making your cooking a lot easier."
So far these spatulas are holding up very well. I have used the larger one every day since I received them about a week ago.. Every other one I have purchased have always started fraying at the tips after about 3 uses even though they said they were rated to 600 degrees. I tried the cheap and more expensive models ($14.00) for one and they all failed. Only time will tell on this set.. So far these have been holding up very well.
These are the highest quality spatulas I have been able to find. They look great and are easy and comfortable to hold. They work well with non-stick pans. Turning pancakes and eggs and making stir fry is easy with these. I like the fact they came in the 2 sizes - regular and small.
"I finally got rid of my 25 year old pans (laughing) and bought my husband (no laughing) new Scan Pans which could last another 25 years. They are expensive. To make sure I don‚Äôt scratch them, I bought new spatulas. These are very strong."
"These have a wonderful design and solid construction, and just the right amount of flex in the handles. My initial thoughts was it was too short, but turns out that all my other spatulas were just a little too long!"
"These cooking utensils are not flimsy and cheaply made. There are some I've had that I use a couple of times, then have to dispose of. I expect these to be in my kitchen a good long time!"
"These 2 spatulas are just what I wanted. They seem sturdy, heat-resistant and have the perfect edge for scooping up pancakes or whatever I want to slide from the pan onto the plate. I like that the handle flexes without being wobbly. Perfect for me!"
Just what I was looking for. Strong enough to turn anything and still safe on my cookware.
These things are great. Rigid to get up under what you are cooking and supple enough to not scratch the pan. Great!
I bought these because they can resist up to 600 degrees of heat! Good product!!
Bought for cooking my morning eggs. Works fine cleans easily
Only had them for about a month but we like them so far.
"I‚Äôve only used a handful of times, but it holds up quite well during cooking and in the dishwasher!"
Very great resistant and easy to clean.
Exactly as described and was what I wanted!
Great for turning eggs or flipping pancakes.
exceeded my expectations
Really good quality products.
These tools work great on my no scratch pans.
Great spatulas at a great price.
easy to use
Work as expected. No problems.
Got these because the spatulas that I had previously just weren't up to the job. Everything stuck to them.
Love them.
Ordered 5 different spatulas from different manufactures. Wife says that the larger of the two in the package is her new absolute favorite. Looking at purchasing a second for a backup.
This product worked as expected and would buy again if needed.
"So far so good after a few weeks. Sturdy, no metal break through."
These are the best very sturdy.
"Very sturdy, easy to clean! Great buy"
Best utensils in my kitchen
"Not exactly what I wanted, but I like it easy to use and a good size. I like the smaller size."
Great product
Great thanks again
Great product
N/a
Anything
Very sturdy & strong
Good quality
The smaller spatula keeps dishwasher marks while the larger one comes out like new. They are heavier than some flimsy ones. Good firm grip. I definitely would purchase these again.
I bought this for my husband and he likes him a lot they‚Äôre easy for him to use and he‚Äôs not afraid of burning them.
I love this makes cooking delightful
I haven‚Äôt used It enough to give an accurate opinion but It Is the right size and they are sturdy
Small spots where silicone has worn away within 2 weeks of use! And I've only used it for flipping eggs.
"These spatulas are kind of thick so its hard to get precise motions, and oil likes to stick to them. They‚Äôre also kind of short but overall they‚Äôre ok."
"Good product, but I was expecting a longer lifespan."
What do you need a book?
Both the photo and the description show 2 different sized spatulas. What I received were 2 spatulas of exactly the same size. Totally identical. Why would I want that? Merchant substituted product for what was actually described and shown. Now I have to go to the department store during this pandemic to return it. THANKS Bankky!
"After they are washed, they are discolored. They look terrible. They have a white color to them."
These work great. I can use in a pan on the stove top when making pancakes or turning food that just came out of the oven!
"These are essential in the kitchens of today IF you use non stick pans. Your pans will last ten times longer, if you exclusively us silicone tools. I don't care what the manufacturer claims. Metal tools destroy non-stick surfaces. Use ONLY wood, or Silicone."
These are great to use and the variety of the sizes make them versatile for different cooking needs.
"Size and thickness are about right for ease of use for flipping everything from pancakes to eggs, works very well."
I use these everyday they are awesome no scratching my griddle and are very easy to clean
Works great. Won't scratch my pans.
Cleaning an ease!!
Very nice
Needed these!
Sturdy and good material
This is a sturdy well made tool ! I urge you to get one if you need it !!
This is a useful set that works as intended. And the price is right.
I bought these silicone spatulas to use in my air fryer. They are exactly what is shown in the ad and I use them often. I am very happy with these spatulas.
"I love these because they are sturdy and can slide under eggs, pancakes and other things without the spatula bending and messing everything up‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"These are super easy to clean, foods don‚Äôt stick to them. I like that they flex, it helps to get underneath some foods. I appreciate that you get two different sizes in the set."
"Well, I had to replace my last one that I had for years and was skeptical. These are not the same but I don't dislike them. They are easy to clean and look nice. I recommend."
"I was looking for a good spatula for omelets and over easy eggs. The smaller one is perfect. Flexible enough to get under the eggs but sturdy enough to flip them. I know it's made for fish, but works perfectly for ü•ö as well!"
"I didn't need both pieces, but could give the larger to my son for his outdoor cooking. Excxellent quality this spatula!"
These are very nice. Mich better than the plastic ones I used before.
"Excellent quality, nice & flexible."
"Very good quality, well worth the money."
The best spatula of this type I've seen.
I like these because they are thin on the ends so easy to use to turn something over. I didn‚Äôt think I would use the smaller one but actually find it very useful.
"If your just flipping light stuff in the pan, maybe! If you need to ‚Äúmore often than not‚Äù Stir food in a frying pan forget it way, way to flexible. So it‚Äôs a single use tool if you can afford the space."
"I bought these spatulas to protect my non-stick cookware that I plan to buy in the future. I have not been very diligent in the past and as a result have had to replace my non-stick pans more often than I would like. I fully expect my new spatulas to do the job they were designed to do,"
Better than anticipated. The whole household loves these. The sizes are perfect for getting around different pans and under and around different foods that need to be flipped.
This spatula has slots so you have to make sure you clean between them. But that is expected. It is a little bit flexible which I like very much.
These spatulas work great. Feel sturdy and easily flip cumbersome items
When I was looking at the spatulas they seemed much smaller. They are rather awkward to use when they are so big.
Great quality and very easy to clean. I love being able to put it in the dishwasher.
My husband has been using them in cooking in the frypan. He says they work very well. I find them easy to clean.
Very nice!
Lasted 70 days the silicone started to shred
Fantastic product heat resistance is wonderful the best of ever used
I gave it a 4 star review because it is so 'non-stick' that my fried eggs don't stick to the spatula and it is hard to flip the eggs (keep sliding off). But works well for other items.
These are nice but are not very strong
The small one is usable but the large one is way to flimsy. You could not pick up a salmon filet with this utensil.
Too long for use in smaller skillets.
i‚Äôve only had these spatulas for a few weeks now and they‚Äôve only been in the dishwasher twice maybe? and the rubber is splitting apart and revealing the metal inside already. not cool guys.
"After removing from dishwasher there were white spots that I couldn‚Äôt get off. The spatula part is not hard, and flexes when trying to chop up items in pan."
"They just came. I am surprised to see the quality, the size, the fit. Nothing cheap at all about these! I can't wait to cook with them. They look and feel so much higher in quality than I have ever owned or used before. I will be back after I use them. I have a feeling I will be super recommending them to you. :) (Because, so far, I am in love.)"
"I like to have a smaller spatula with just the right angle in it for flipping eggs, etc. This one fills the bill. Works great and easy to clean. Haven't used the larger one yet but I'm sure I will soon."
"Well flexible without being wimpy, 2 sizes are great. Use on eggs, bacon, sandwiches, fish, crepes. Very nice."
"Maybe a little heavy, but, otherwise fine."
It is a more bendy than I wanted but works well
Great product
"Easy to clean, heat resistant."
The small one is really good- it‚Äôs sturdy and very convenient to use. But the tall/big one is subpar. It‚Äôs not sturdy and bends easily if you put a little pressure on it!!
"Received 2 spatulas in April, by May the metal has cut through the end of the smaller one. I don't cook much so they have not been used often. There was a bump in the silicone close to the area that is ripped open which may be the cause of the metal interior popping through but unknown for sure."
They are good quality and work well . Wife likes the larger one for flipping omelets
"I liked the look of this spatula but the metal right before the silicone flipper and the silicone end itself bend down toward the frying pan and the eggs slide right off before you're able to flip them. No matter which one I used, or how forcefully I slid the spatula under the eggs, it was the same problem. They fall off sideways or frontwise in mid-flip, when trying to do easy-over, breaking the yokes. TLDR: Too bendy to be of any use."
Je les aime bien mais elles sont un petit peu trop √©paisses ... mais elles fonctionnent tout de m√™me bien ...
Bin sehr zufrieden.
"The metal frame is not long enough inside the silicone area, and caused the spatula is not sturdy enough. if I use it as a flipper for fried egg or pancake, then it's a good one, because I can push down the spatula to make it more flat closer to the frypan to flip the pancake easier. However, I bought this one for stir fry, which is not strong enough to stir food when I was doing the cooking. I have use more effort to stir the food. therefore I will give below average for this product."
"The price was definitely worth it! My husband does the cooking, and his utensils were literally melting on the edges. They were so hard to get clean. Since I do the cleaning, I just couldn't stand it any more. After reading reviews and careful consideration, I chose these utensils. I think they will serve my husband well for years to come!"
Like the versatility in using with nonstick pots & pans. Very sturdy over previous ones I owned. Dishwasher safe and they don‚Äôt curl up from the heat of the pans or skillets
Started using cast iron pans and needed something to withstand the high heat. These are very sturdy and just what I needed‚Ä¶
"These are sturdy spatulas, can flip an egg easy, clean up easy. I put them in my dishwasher"
These spatulas are well made and work well. I got them specifically for my groovy new ceramic pans and they do not disappoint!
Perfect selection of spatulas. Sturdy and easy to clean.
Items are as advertised and are just what I was looking for. Well made and easy to clean.
"I love the variety with getting 3 together! Love the wide width of the slotted widest one! Should be great for turning a fried egg, usually not wide enough, Father‚Äôs Day gift, and I expect they will b great!"
these are great they don't get hot and work great easy to clean
I love my spatulas! I have someone with memory issues who melted my old ones. Love them!
Sturdy
I love these. All the perfect sizes
With non stick pan. Work great
good
Thin edges let you turn around easy anything on your pan. Excellent set.
Would definitely recommend this set
These work. After buying several nonstick utensils (that melted in my frying pans) I finally read the fine print. These are good for cooking the rest melt at boiling water temperature. Obvious frauds
"Should have bought these a long time ago. Very nice, well made."
Good quality and price was very good.
"Super strong, easy to clean. Nothing sticks."
"Such an awesome tool, great quality, true to the heat resistance."
Good
I love all three pieces. Smooth in my Pots and Pans.
Nice heavy duty set of spatulas.
Worth the money.
It does what I expect
"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll last and they definitely do the job. But the silicon wasn‚Äôt refined/trimmed on my egg spatula and I had to peel off the excess leaving little rubber pieces on my table. Not a big deal because now that I‚Äôve done that, I probably don‚Äôt need to worry about it, but it is a quality control thing."
I like everything about them when using them. What I don't like so much is when I put them in dishwasher they always come out spotted. I just hand wash now.
Quality is fair. You get what you pay for. I wish the company would produce better quality ones and I would love to pay more for better ones.
Have had these for about 2 months and they are not holding up well. One is torn. Several have a buildup that is hard to clean off. I have much older spatulas that are in better shape.
Product worked well enough initially but once it came out of the dishwasher they were discolored and covered in soap marks that will not come off. The spatulas are fine for what they are but don‚Äôt false advertise them as dishwasher safe.

"Having, for DECADES, purchased from major chain store, my cooking utensils. I decided to try these. even on an older pan, boy those eggs came off almost effortlessly. I say Almost, because it's an old pan, I may be up for a new cookware set. These turners are lovely, they are sturdy! and nothing sticks to silicone, except silicone! food sure doesn't!! ( and yes these have a metal core in them, but you can feel that it spreads out within the paddle, so there will be no slipping off. ( like some of those cake bowl spatulas) I really like these."
"I've not had ANY food stick to them at all! The larger oval one can defeat ANY pancake. The longer one can handle a long fish fillet without tearing it up. The fillet is beautiful when plated for the table. The smaller, more normal sized and shaped one, is the one I use the most, and it's just right. This set will become my go-to housewarming present in the future. I'm the practical sort."
"These are very nice significant quality, they are not flimsy, I have been waiting for them to come in stock."
Happy with my Silicone Spatulas Set for Nonstick Cookware works great
Easy to use
"this is huge!!! just what i was looking for in scale and shape , decent price, fast ship! thank you!!"
"Bought this to replace a similar tool which had broken. Handy size, good grip, silicone spatula end, ideal for picking food up that's smaller sized or for turning oven chips to give a consistent colour. If you want to pick up breaded fish or items of that size then you should get a wider item."
"I love cooking and baking and has been in the market for a good spatula set for a while. The ones I had were 10+ years old and I was hoping to find a new set with the same or better quality to last for decades. I am very particular about these spatulas. But this set just checked all my boxes!! It came with really nice packaging, well boxed and every piece individually wrapped. I love the color I picked, very elegant with my kitchen setup. This set is definitely of high end quality. So far used it twice and everything lived up to my expectation! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for good quality additions to your kitchen!!"
"These came in great packaging and are very sturdy quality. The brush does great at spreading butter on the griddle, the bristles don‚Äôt melt or break off like my old hair bristled kitchen basting brush. I love how this set includes a long skinny spatula, can‚Äôt wait to try that one out on cakes. They also match my kitchen theme and look great in my homemade mason jar canisters!"
"This is a perfect spatula set with a good variety for all sorts of uses. We use them daily and they have held up well since we bought them several months ago. No splitting or cracking, and they still look like new. I would buy then again if I needed spatulas and would recommend them 100%."
Like this product for being heat resistant and durable along with sturdiness. I have no cons to mention on this product. Very satisfied customer.

Value and quality
They are high quality spatulas. The packaging is attractive. I would buy more for hostess or holiday gifting.
Not bad.
Great quality. Love the color. Dishwasher safe!
I received these as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had recently purchased spatulas from Pampered Chef. These seem stronger and more durable. I‚Äôve them daily since I received them and would recommend them.
Great quality highly recommend
"I was completely disappointed with this! Small, made for children! I am returning as soon as possible. DO NOT BUY! AMAZON YOU SHOULD STOP SELLING JUNK!!!!!"
These utensils are extremely small and would be difficult to use to cook with unless you are a midget or youth cook with small hands.
"The material is sturdy and there is nice flexibility. However, the handles are too short, a little over hand grip space so your hand is definite close to a hot pan - would not purchase again because of this."
"I needed to upgrade my spatulas, saw the very positive reviews on these and decided to take a chance. I purchased the red and they are just gorgeous. They will take care of all my spatula/spoonula needs. They seem very sturdy, and the box that they come in are perfect for gifting. I do a gift exchange with cooking friends every year at the holidays, and I do believe this will be one of my gifts for someone next year."
"These are so awesome and so worth the price, I've been looking for a new set and came across these and just love them, these are definitely a must buy"
I absolutely luv these. My kids got me the red ones as a gift. I had to order a second set black just to mix it up. Hot or cold they are perfect! One peice so no water getting inside when you wash them!
These spatulas are comparable to the higher end brands and are durable and aesthetically attractive at the same time. I have thrown out the others I had as this collection comprises all the sizes you need in your kitchen. Very happy with the quality and color!
This product sucks!socks!! Only used three times and two of the spatulas have little chunks out of it and one has little splits and I have never put in the dishwasher!! Too late for me to return but I hope I can prevent anyone else from getting a very shoddy product!! Wish I could select zero stars!!
These were above my expectations. I threw out all my old spatulas after I used these. These are a solid one piece unit so you won't ever have to worry about bacteria issues. Totally worth the money!
Love them! Bought them for a gift now!
"Love the one piece construction of these tools, and the flexibility is just right! The variety of shapes and sizes make them useful multitaskers."
"This is my first Silicon Spatula set, I have been waiting for so long to buy one. And this set is worth waiting. Quality is good, like the color. Appreciate the packaging. All the spatulas came in seperate packing/covers."
"These feel very sturdy. The weight is more than twice that of my old similar spatula, which is awesome. Feels like you have something good to hold!"
Good quality and heat resistant.
Good quality spatulas! I like that they are one piece so cleaning would be much easier. They came in a very nice box and would make a great gift.
"My mom absolutely loved getting these for Christmas. She can now throw away her paint brush that she used for basting, and can now easily reach inside jars. The variety of types of spatulas is excellent."
I love these. Multiple colors to choose from but I love the red. Very bright. These are exactly as described. I am also really impressed with the packaging. The box included a separate protective sleeve for each spatula. These are very durable. Great value for the price I paid. Highly recommend for anyone looking for high quality colorful silicone spatulas.
I just received this set and I was surprised at how sturdy and heavy duty they seem. I have an older set that looks very similar but just the feel and overall weight of this set makes them seem much better quality right out of the box.
These are very well-made and have durable quality. I cannot wait to use these for my soapmaking in the future.
Arrived on time and were packed neatly. Excellent quality and easy to handle!
I bought this silicone spatula set and it arrived in days. It‚Äôs the perfect set for me as I have small hands and they are very strong and durable. They fit perfectly in the drawer with my other silverware. I love them.
"I bought these as a replacement to my other outdated kitchen utensils and absolutely love the silicone set better than my old plastic ones. The set is heat resistant, BPA free, and bacteria resistant. I would highly recommend this set to anyone interested in a new set"
These are a great product
I've been searching for great silicone spatulas for a long time. The search is over. The flexibility of these spatulas is the key feature that makes them great. I especially like the curved spoon-shaped spatulas because they get every bit of batter out of a mixing bowl. You can't go wrong with this set.
"This BPA free, single mold spatula set is the kind of lifelong quality you're seeking. The last set you'll need to buy."
Nice quality!!! Love it!
I love this set and the black color is delightful!
"I love the variety of sizes and firmness. While none of the spatulas were flimsy, some had a little more bend than others. I tried capturing the ‚Äúfirmness‚Äù in my photos. A great all around set. And I love the red color."
"Was reluctant to give up my traditional wooden spoons but seeing how much gunk has built up over the years, led me to these silicon ones. Was a little wary of them expecting them to melt if left in a pan ...I was wrong. The long slim one is perfect for scraping all the contents of a canned product out. Easy to clean, look fab and def serve their purpose. I expect I'll have these longer than my old yucky wooden ones."
""
For the price of you get alot for your money. Just wish the handles were a bit longer
I like cook and this silicon spatula are really good especially for cakes. Good quality and easy to clean.
"all as expected, happy with my purchase"
Very pleased with purchase.
Great set
Haven't used all the utensils bit so far so good
The pot is great but the utensils are small!
"With the title ultra flexible I wasn't sure what that would be like. Would it even hold up a pancake or would it bend under the weight? I got them based on the reviews and I wanted a nice thin spatula that would go under stuff easily. We had an $12 pancake one that didn't work well and fell apart at the handle. These are the best ones I have ever used. I haven't used the biggest with slots yet but I'm sure I will at some point. The small and medium sizes are perfect. The med one is great for pancakes and the small one was perfect when I made zucchini cakes. If you make huge pancakes the large one would be amazing. The tips are just slightly flexible, not the entire thing so it has enough stiffness to hold up heavier items."
"I ordered these spatulas (""spatulae"" in Latin?) and they arrived packaged perfectly and in great shape. I washed them and immediately put them to work: I used the medium sized one for sausage and eggs, then switched to the big one for my grandson's pancakes. Both are very easy to handle (unlike the one I ditched when these arrived) and cleanup was a breeze. If other products by StarPack are as good as these spatulas, my kitchen is going to be completely outfitted with their products. I'll definitely be buying other StarPack products...great quality good looking and very good pricing."
"These spatulas were EXACTLY what I‚Äôve been looking for! They are perfect to use on my expensive pots and pans and also they not so good onesü§™  The main reason I wanted new spatulas was that all the others I have would ALWAYS destroy my flipping of the egg talent üòÜ Well what I really mean is that no matter what pan, stick or non stick, nonstick spray or oil I used my eggs would ALWAYS stick to the spatula.  I have so called silicone and wooden ones that I have tried but it NEVER fails the eggs stick to the end of the utensil causing the egg to break and/or stick to the spatulas üò§  The ones I just received are nothing but AMAZING and have made my egg cooking talents a bit better again, so THANK YOUüòç"
"I've been using these spatulas for a few months now--I use the solid one every day and the others occasionally--and I love them because they are not only pretty to look at, but work great. They have a nice tapered edge to get under whatever is in the pan, have enough give to be a bit flexible but are stiff enough to lift and flip whatever is being cooked. When I first got them I had a question about the large slotted spatula which seemed to make a snapping sound--I wanted to know whether it was loose or this was normal, and received a quick, polite, informative response from the company (it turned out to be normal--and it IS sturdy). I'm so happy I bought these!"
"I recently purchased the set of three turners because I had previously purchased another item from StarPack that works so amazingly well that I thought I would try the turners out. It was a good decision---the broad turner is perfect for flipping quesadillas, the medium for gently turning those crumbly bean burgers, and the small works for practically everything. Now I have a set of 5 utensils on order from StarPack and can hardly wait until they arrive and I can try them out. These turners are strong and well engineered, so I wonder what the negative writers about them actually used them for!! As a person who cooks most meals from scratch, I highly recommend them to all serious cooks in need of turners that do not scratch."
"Of course you can use a ""trick of the wrist"" to flip an omelette in a properly oiled pan, but for the risk adverse like ourselves, we generally rely on our utensils, like these. This is quite a size upgrade compared to our old silicone turner and allows to make big thick buckwheat pancakes and 4 egg omelettes with less fuss. Shopping for spatulas/turners on Amazon is overwhelming so if you're ready to click ""Buy"" you can have faith in this being a decent value for your cash."
"Sometimes am amazed at what I think I order and what arrives; this certainly exemplified the notion; have NEVER seen or even imagined spatulas like this set, two of three are so large, one spatula is the size of one of our frying pans so certainly would accommodate an omelette or even pancakes with one flip. Not quite sure what the second large one is intended for, one is regular size, they are colorful, appear substantially crafted, sure to be conversation pieces. Believe I'll order a set for my grandson who is a chef as a surprise in a care package."
"I was looking for spatulas and something to add some color - I didn‚Äôt want the same old black spatulas and I ran across the StarPak Silicone spatulas in a teal color! It was exactly what I was looking for to add some color to my kitchen. They are a set of 3 great sized spatulas, that are heat resistant and in a pretty color! I was excited to try them out and they worked great and were an easy clean up!"
"I love this spatula set. The silicone makes them very easy to clean, and they won‚Äôt get the buildup on the edge like plastic ones do. The middle sized one is a bit floppy on the handle, but not so much to interrupt my cooking. It just takes a second to get used to it ‚Äòpopping‚Äô back and forth depending on its use."
"I was gifted one of these spatulas for Christmas. I like it so much, I just purchased the whole set. Their flexibility really helps get right under foods and make clean flips. These spatulas and a well seasoned pan make stove top cooking a dream come true. I have hand washed them so far. I don't think there would be any issues with washing them in a dishwasher, but I don't have one at this time."
"Now have a a whole set of the Star Pack kitchen utensils. Bought the rubber spatula set and liked them so much, I ordered the rest of the different sets. Love then all, even the regular spatulas (turners). Only complaint is that the silicone natural makes the turners too slippery to flip fried eggs easily . Had to try to flip my kid's eggs 5 times before I finally accomplished it. They kept slipping off. Was hoping to get rid of my old plastic turners, but will keep one just to flip eggs."
These are not the same color as my turquoise container and utensils but I'm keeping them anyway. They are great and so much easier to use for flipping than my smaller ones.
"Nice product truly well constructed. You can see through the silicone (the ones I purchased are a beautiful,vibrant red) to see how much metal is reinforcing the spatula. By far a much superior product then what I have had in my kitchen. Delivered on time and were as described."
"I've used these a few times and they are well made, attractive and a useful addition to my kitchen. The very large, slotted one is great for omelets and pancakes but since it is flexible I'm not sure if it will hold very heavy items (might bend down and your pancakes could wind up back in the pan LOL). Overall, they are a good value and I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"I only give the sturdiness a 4 star, but that is because it feels a bit strange in the hand. I would probably give it six stars. Because of how flexible they are. This was the reason I bought them and I wanted to use them for a good while before leaving a review. They do feel a little bit flimsy, but they must in order to be this flexible. I love them."
"These are super easy to clean, and the metal running through the spatula means that's it's also pretty sturdy. Our reasoning for purchasing was to replace our old plastic ones that were falling apart and just generally not as safe. I've already bought more replacement items from StarPack."
"Very pleasantly surprised with the quality of these spatulas! They are comparable in price to other sparulasbi have purchased before that were clearly inferior in quality. I was hesitant to purchase these given the same price point, but was hoping the raving reviews would be true, and they were! The silicone will rid well with all our dishes, and I expect them to hold up well throughout the years"
I really do love these utensils. I bought them to replace a tired old set that has seen better days. I really like that they are strong enough to flip over a piece of meat yet thin and flexible enough to flip eggs to make an omelet. So far I have been very pleased
"These are perfect. One of the spatulas is huge and I thought I would not use it, but I was wrong. It is actually great for flipping quesadillas. They are a cute color and are holding up great!"
"Perfect for cooking my omelet several times a week! Needed a wider, thinner utensil for flipping my omelet. Sturdy & thin enough to slip under it without tearing the eggs. I use my cast iron skillet and have had no issues with the heat or melting. Easy to clean too!"
The slotted spatula is not silicone but is a hard plastic material. The other accompanying spatula broke off little pieces from the edges after the first use
I was looking for a new set of spatulas to use with my new Gotham Steel pans. I came across these and saw that they had great ratings. There are three different sizes. The small one is great for the majority of my needs but the two larger ones should be good for omelette and pancakes. The quality is much better than the plastic ones I replaced. The silicone spatulas have a flexible edge that can form around the edge of the pan but the steel underneath the silicone provides support to flip anything. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.
"These are a great addition to my kitchen utensils for use with my non-stick cookware. They have worked great for pancakes, sandwiches, and omelettes. The handle thickness is just right for my hands, and the flexible blades perform well at getting between my food and the cooking surface without tearing my food."
I love these turners!!! The red color is perfect in my kitchen. Just used one of them today for the first time.. made scrambled eggs and it worked great during the cooking and serving. I got this set to replace my go to turner from another set. The turner broke in half. I don't ever see anything like this happening at all.. So impressed with the quality and workmanship on these that I went back and ordered the 4 piece spatula set also!
"When I got the box it had 2 of the small turners. A quick email to the seller and they had the missing spat out to me within a weeks time, never asked for the extra one back, think I will give it a friend so they can see how nice these are! Worked as I had hoped on a new gas stove with a nonstick (I thought it was going to cast iron and only have metal turners) so got this set and very happy with them and the service of the seller, will look into more of their products as I need them!"
"I love them. The large one will flip a pancake, the medium one does fried eggs, and I have not yet used the small one. They are so much better than the plastic one from Walmart (too thick)."
"I love the star pack brand! I have two sets of cooking utensils from them that I got as a gift, and needed these over sized spatulas to complete my set! The biggest one is PERFECT for pancakes, French toast and even quesadillas. Definitely recommend them!"
"My last spatulas had plastic handles and melted and broke off. These will not have that problem. They work great and are pretty. Maybe you don't need the last, but pretty is nice. Would buy again from this seller. Product is what they said it was and had good delivery time."
"These are good quality spatula's and they work extremely well. I can't say enough about the largest ones that are used for omelets, I always had trouble with the omelet falling apart when flipping them over but not with these. Another great thing is how easily they clean up. Bottom line they are worth the price."
Not only are these very attractive but they work really well and I like the different sizes. Really good product
"Arrived today, just in time to take out smoldering cheese sourdough bread slices from the toaster oven. The long spatula was the perfect size to scoop up the foil holding the two slices. In the past, it was a juggling act with smoldering cheese dripping along the edges and scalded knuckles from the hot toaster oven."
I like these spatulas a lot. I used them almost daily. The different sizes come in handy for everything from tacos to pancakes. Their flexibility helps get under food without breaking it up. I purchased StarPack Home products in the past and have been very please.
These spatulas are fantastic. Very sturdy and easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. Love them.
"Great right off out of the box ! Washed them up and put them to work right away. Flexible enough to get into hard places, but stiff enough to lift some fairly heavy foods (my wife's meatloaf) lol."
"The product works well just as advertised, I thought The price was a little high ,but you get what you pay for great product."
Gave these to my sister for Christmas and she loves them. They feel like they are real good for getting under food for flipping. Might buy some for myself!
Works well in really high temperature frying.
Perfect for flipping and all other frying pan needs.
"My wife is always struggling to flip eggs, pan cakes, etc. but with these extra large and flexible thin turners she hasn't had a problem. The Silicone turners are very easy to clean and look very durable. Larger turners like these are very hard to find that are flexible and thin enough to slide under things that you are cooking."
"Just so you know, these aren‚Äôt regular size spatulas they are pretty large. At first I thought they would be too large however I am getting used to them. Nice turquoise color."
Love the color- very sturdy
This is a great product! It's very flexible but yet strong when hold food. It's easy to clean and looks just a beautiful after cooking and than it did when it was purchased! I highly recommend this product!
"So pretty. I have them hanging from magnetic hooks on the side of my refrigerator closest to my range. I like how they feel in my hands and how large they are so when I try to turn something in the pan, I can get the whole thing onto the spatula."
"These are exactly as advertised, easy to work with and clean up quickly. Color is perfect as well. Definitely recommend to others."
They are very nice and sturdy! The steel in the handle is a great idea! Fun colors too!
"I am a horrible cook. I can ruin anything that requires flipping in the pan, in a heartbeat. These spatulas make it possible for me to find success in the kitchen. I love the way they really get under the food. They clean up very easily, too."
Great collection and practical addition to any kitchen
"I like the set, But I would like them a little biger."
"Really like the Star brand, these utensils work well"
"Bought these months ago and have used them heavily. My double egg flip is on point with the widest spatula, my egg game has never been stronger!"
"I have not used these yet but they appear to be perfect for what I need, especially a basic normal size turner that is easy to hold."
I bought mostly for the wide spatula because the one I had broke. I ended up loving these more than the one I had. I actually use the smaller one a lot. Recommend.
"These are really nice - well made and a good assortment of sizes. They have metal inside for stability but are still nice and thin, so are easy to use. Highly recommend."
"I wanted to wait until I had used these for a while before commenting They are perfect, no melting on edges. Great color."
"I love these! They‚Äôve held up well to heat so far, nothing sticks to them and they‚Äôre well made. Love the color."
"These were so necessary in my kitchen after my husband melted all of our spatulas. These are indestructible, attractive, very easy to clean and dishwasher safe. You really can't beat the quality, especially at this price! I highly recommend them and will definitely buy again."
"Finally great egg turners! We have some very nice pans that we do not want scratched. These are fabulous! The ends are thin and flexible. No problem flipping an egg with our new turner. My husband used one on the grill, and no melting. We are very pleased."
"These are the best I have ever used. I love that they are completely safe to use on my expensive calphalon cookware. Plus, the teal color matches my kitchen perfectly."
Very sturdy. Having the metal on the inside gives it the rigidity many of these silicon utensils lack.
Heat proof silicone over stainless steel! So far so good. Appears to be a high quality product. Now I can throw out all the nylon garbage that you find in the brick and mortar stores.
"I love silicone already, so had to try these. The big slotted is too big to flip one egg, but can easily turn an omelette, or flip large fillet of fish ....great. The other two are a bit smaller but still goodsized. Highly recommend."
Purchased these to use with a new non stick griddle. I really like these! I'm looking forward to using them a lot. They may very well become my favorite kitchen utensils. (along with the matching tongs)
"I had purchased a new griddle with a ceramic coating and needed quality utensils that would not damage the griddle surface. This set of spatulas is perfect. The inner stainless core makes them sturdy, but is still flexible."
"Outstanding, quality items! A true kitchen must have!"
"I had an older turner for years that finally broke down. It was like the one in the middle. These are as good a quality as that one, plus if you cook a lot at high temp, you won't end up with pieces of nylon in your food. these were under 24 bucks, my single from 2012 was $16. You can do the math. Good value. If bad happens, I'll let you know."
"I have only had them a couple of days, but I am impressed. Nice and thin for flipping over-easy eggs, but strong enough to lift heavy burgers off the grill. Cleaning is super easy too. Love them..."
These are very wide spatulas. I am using them in a weekly rental unit and wanted something sturdy so the renters don't tear up the pots and pans. These fit my requirements nicely..
Easy to clean and easy to use
"This is a fantastic set of turners. The metal core provides strength, the silicone allows these to be used with non-stick surfaces, and the turner edges are both thin/strong enough to easily get under and lift anything you would expect it to."
Really nice. The smallest one is like an average spatula. The large is big enough to flip a large pancake easily. Nice thin edge to get under eggs etc.and reinforced metal in the center and handle.
"Before receiving this spatula life was dull, grim, and overall lacking purpose. The package arrived early and the bubble wrap was superb. Upon opening the envelope my eyes lit up - this was clearly ‚Äúthe One‚Äù. I can honestly say this spatula has changed my life for the better. Not only are my omelets coming out more refined and undoubtedly enhanced, but I‚Äôve overall been more inspired to be a better person. One of character, fortitude, and grandiosity. Thank you spatula, For making me a kinder, happier, and - dare I say - more spiritual, individual. Jakob"
"While this turner is quite sturdy, it's not as heat resistant as described. I used this less than 10 times on things like frying eggs or fish or stir fry, and already the coating at the edges has come off. Seems to melt. I rarely write bad reviews, however, I feel like the manufacturer really need to change the description on this product, because, the main feature I wanted from this was, heat resistance leading to durability. Unfortunately, this product does not seem to live up to it. Really disappointed."
"The spatula is exceptionally well balanced. That was the first thought that poppec into my head when I picked it up from its delivery box. It felt really good in my hand. And this is not the comment of someone just trying to sell the product, I‚Äôm an actual purchaser and user. To take this a step further, the cost of one labeled black2 was on sale, I purchased a second one the next day. Well balanced. OK just a joke but I wanted to prove a point. I wanted to cook something else just so I could use a spatula again. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ In other words, this is the best flipper I have ever owned. Would I buy it again, I already have."
"As always, Kitchen Aid has produced another success with this product. This pancake turner (or simply, ‚Äúturner‚Äù) is sturdy, crafted from material that will not scratch enamel-coated non-stick pans and withstands a good deal of heat. I do not know the exact level of heart that this turner will withstand because I‚Äôve not tested it; I didn‚Äôt want to destroy it. However, I‚Äôve used it to scrambled eggs and perform other tasks on the stovetop at high heat, and it performed well without curling or peeling. I should think that unless one held it directly in the fire of a gas range that it should be fine. I would highly recommend this product because of its durability and ease of cleaning."
I prefer egg/hamburger turners that are of a stiffer quality. Most are flimsy and the food that is being cooked slides off before I'm ready. This one is just right. The only complaint I have is that the handle is too long. The last one I had was a little shorter and was easier to use. I will make it work until I find a handle that is a bit shorter.
We own a lot of silicone spatulas but they do not do the same job as a plastic one. We bought two of these. They are great. They‚Äôre sturdy and easy to clean. They‚Äôre not too big or too small. The leverage from the handle is perfect. These are my favorite spatulas!
"Bought this for my husband, who does not like spatulas that break easily. This is very sturdy. Hoping it will last a while. So far, it is easy to clean, and there are no pieces coming off the end, which was another issue we had with others. Will update review if any issues in future."
"I've had quite a few spatulas in my life. I ran restaurants for some years. At home though, everything is non-stick needing plastic tools. Some of them are good, others look like the guy who designed them was drunk. This spatula falls into the very good range. Nice weight, good balance and the blade is at the proper angle for working."
"We own another Kitchen Aid spatula and it has lasted well compared to cheap brands that melt and flake quickly when used. This one is nicely made, have used it, and like it well. No issues with use or cleaning.... The only disadvantage is that it can't hang on a utensil hook...no hole in the handle. Since this brand lasts, it's not a big issue finding a different way of putting it away. I would buy it again."
"I mean wow! I thought my life was over when I broke my Spatula City spatula. I will miss Spatula City, it was the best store. Then here comes KitchenAid with a god tier spatula that has changed the spatula game for all time. One you have used this spatula, there is no going back. If you don't buy this spatula you will regret it."
"Had a nice scratch free unit that drove me nuts trying to clean it, had to use scratchy pads and scrapers. This one is a dream, works great, no heat damage and easy to clean . Best one I have had. Not to speak of a good price."
"KitchenAid makes a good product line, but I was not expecting this spatula to be quite so sturdy. It will be lovingly known as the Spatula From Hell in my kitchen, and I'm sure it will outlast me and at least one future generation."
Nice egg Turner. Purchased a Bella electric skillet that does not permit a metal egg Turner. Picked this plastic unit up at same time. Works well and is much sturdier that other flimsy plastic egg Turner I have used. Good price for a Kitchen Aid product.
A quality product that easily slips under the eggs and allows you to gently turn them over. Works well with any type of cookware surface or grill without scratching it.
"Solid little spatula, easy to clean and able to withstand some pressure. It‚Äôs not as wide as some but has a little more strength for lifting, and cutting and freeing stuff from the side of a pan, like lasagna or a casserole."
Need a fry turner. This one feels properly heavy and sturdy (in contrast to those thin and soft). So far so good. Recommended.
"This turner is wide enough to use on fried eggs, long enough to keep you away from the heat, and designed to provide a comfortable grip and wrist posture. Will not scratch non-stick pans, yet its edge is sharp enough to scrape up sticky or burned foodstuff."
"My previous spatulas had broken, melted or disappeared. This one is great for all my cooking purposes. Very, very sturdy, and dishwasher safe"
I always liked kitchenaide products. This is a good quality utensil in my opinion. It is sturdy and has a little weight to it. Unlike the ones sold in discount and dollar stores.
"This is sturdy, doesn‚Äôt melt with high temperatures and is easy to clean and I love that it is a good length and a good sturdy large surface to pick up an egg without breaking the yoke!!"
But a darn good one! This was the first piece of this collection that I purchased. It was so good that I purchased the rest.
"This spatula is extremely sturdy and stiff. So if you‚Äôre looking for a spatula that has a little bend to it, this is not the one for you. Works great for heavier foods and when you have to scrape at something."
This item was purchased as a gift. Well received.
Sturdy turner. Doesn't bend like so many cheaper ones.
"Just as I expected. Haven't used very much yet but it should work out fine for my purposes. Pretty large in size. Would be great for outside grill. I would have preferred the handle just a little less large for my stovetop use, but that is just my preference. Others may like it just the way it is. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
High quality and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. I highly recommend.
"The spatula is sturdy, easy to use and clean. id highly recommend"
This kitchen tool is the perfect size and washes easily.
Heat resistant and attractive. Well built and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. What more can you ask for?
Study handle so picking up is a breeze and the handle is long enough to keep away from the heat. Nice product.
"Great heat resistance, very sturdy and easy to clean"
Easy use Large face
"Good quality, perfect length."
"Well made and easy to use/clean, just slightly bigger than I thought."
"sturdy, heat resistant, easy to clean, flips well"
"Nice and solid. Replaced an older flimsy one, should have done that a long time ago. Will never go back to cheap ones after this."
This is a perfect spatula!
Bought this to replace my spatulas of 20 years. It is nice and sturdy and easy to clean!
I was surprised how heavy this thing is. Feels very sturdy and well-built. Works great with my non-stick pans when I need a stiff spatula
Just what I needed. Sturdy and stiff enough so I can flip over easy sggs perfectly. Great kitchen utencil.
Have used it for awhile now and have no complaints! Very sturdy and well made! Feels good in the hand!
Very sturdy... My other one seems so flimsy now next to it. Good buy
I like the size and ease to hold onto with the large handle.
Very well weighted. Seems very sturdy. Great purchase. Would buy again.
"No surprises, just a good sturdy spatula. Would recommend."
It's sturdiness is its best feature.
Good quality
I LOVE THIS ! ITS BIG TOO !
"Great quality, I‚Äôve used it to make eggs & grill burgers"
Love it !! Perfect for my husbands use!!!!!
Fine - should stand up better than the old one I had
"Very nice, very sturdy. At the same time light enough to use."
Exactly what I expected it to be. Very happy.
Heat resistant and very easy to use
Good and sturdy product I really like this.
Feels very nice and study. Pretty easy to clean and it came well packaged. My partner is very happy with it :)
Its sturdy and heat resistant
"Works well in the kitchen. Even with sustained use, it remains easy to clean (both with hands and dishwasher) and resists heat well. 10/10"
Liked long handle.
"It's incomprehensible to me how a product was rendered completely unusable on day 1 after I used it exactly as intended. The manufacturers must have never tested it on basic use cases. How can such a reputable company sell a tool that melts almost instantly in pans on medium heat?  The very first time I used this spatula/turner, I was frying pancakes on medium heat with a nonstick pan on a glass stovetop. I did not leave the turner sitting in the pan. I only touched it to the pan briefly while checking the bottoms of the pancakes and flipping them.  Nevertheless, the part at the tip already melted and re-hardened. When I touch that part with my fingers now, tiny black bits of material break off the melted end. I'm afraid some of these got into the pancakes accidentally.  I'll be buying a new silicone spatula/turner instead and using that in the future."
I expected a spatula and I got one!
As described very sturdy
Very sturdy
Good
Was a gift
"Sturdy, well-made, will stand up to the eggs that dare try to stick to the pain."
Works
It‚Äôs a bit too long
Works great no problems.
Great utensil! Flips eggs with ease.
"Handles fill up with dirty water when you wash them. Even after drying and sitting for a couple of days, smelly water drips out of the handle into the food you are cooking. Gross... This is NOT a sanitary product."
"When you wash these spatulas, water gets stuck from the space where the silicone meets the metal; water leaks from the space when you use them to cook with."
I like having extra spatulas for removing food off pans and stuff from the oven and these work great for that. they work well for cooking too. They don't replace my metal spatula though (which I use to cut pizza and such). I liked the thinner handles of these cause it makes it easier to fit them in my utensil holder and the color matched my d√©cor.
"I absolutely love these spatulas! They are exactly what I was looking for. They're sturdy silicone, heat resistant, easy clean-up, and come in some nice colors. I can use these on my non-stick pans and not worry about scraping my pans. The only very minor drawback is that dried water shows exceptionally well on the blue colored spatulas."
"I purchased the ladles first and came back for the spatulas! Love Love Love Flexible but not floppy, great sturdy handle and fits your hand very well. I would highly recommend these as gifts too! Every kitchen needs these spatulas!"
These are far superior to anything I have gotten in a department store. The very ends are a little bit flexible (to get under things) but the rest of the item is strong and perfect. I was afraid it would be flimsy but it's not.
"This silicon set was just what I was looking for. Love the color, easy to clean, nice and sturdy. Happy I bought them."
Good quality/well made/great value for the cost.
These are great. Love them.
I really love the feel of these! I will buy again
"I bought some new Kirkland Cookware and did not want to use metal turners in my new skillets, so I ordered these because I thought the price was reasonable. I have used both the slotted and solid and they have worked well. The edge is a little thick for getting under some things, but I have had that issue with other silicone turners I have owned. In looking at the reviews before I bought these I noticed some people complained about water getting into the handles and then dripping into the food when they used them. I have not had that issue, but I do not soak them in dishwater. I either wash them immediately or put them in the dishwasher, so I can't be sure if soaking created this issue for others."
I absolutely love these!!! They don't bend and are very sturdy!!!
"I have a tendency to overcook (and sometimes burn) food! These utensils are perfect for me, because the ends of the spatulas are not permanently scorched."
"I always wanted a spa, I thought thats what this was. It wasn't, its a cooking tool! Who knew. It worked out well though because I needed a new one. Good value"
Sturdy and easy to clean. A bit too slippery for eggs unless you‚Äôre really careful.
Bought this as a gift and the recipient really likes it. It gets the job done and doesn‚Äôt look cheap like some other products I‚Äôve seen. Good buy
"Very easy to clean, feels well built and very sturdy."
"These are very well made, reasonably priced, easy to clean. Sturdy. Love them!!"
I am throwing out ALL of my old spatulas -- these are the BEST that I have ever purchased. You can't go wrong with these.
"I like the sturdy, yet flexible silicone, but was disappointed in the color. I expected turquoise blue like the ones pictured, but instead they are more of a blue-gray color. I really wanted the color pictured, so was let down by that, but they do seem to be a good turner overall. I haven't used them yet however. I do like the soft grip handle, and soft turner area so it won't scratch my pans."
I took a chance on these because of the price. I‚Äôm really happy I did. Both spatulas are really well made and have a nice heaviness/sturdiness I will buy this set again
"Perfect! Finally found aa good combo that doesn't stain, rust, peel or hold water. Strong and no bend."
Works great...enough said
Love these. They look great and are so nice to cook with. I highly recommend.
Just what I was looking for very nice and sturdy and easy to clean
Easy to clean and are sturdy and can take the heat
spatulas work really well and good deal for the price.
"High quality, great price."
This spatula was very sturdy to use and super easy to clean.
Well worth the price would buy them again in a heartbeat
Too early to tell but is fine.
Great kitchen tools. Fits well into our utensil organizer.
"These silicone turners are great. Very sturdy, easy to clean, and good dexterity. Would definitely purchase these again in the future when we need more!"
Very Sturdy turners!!! These were purchased to replace old ones - these were shipped out the next day!!
"I love these spatulas! They are the perfect size, very sturdy and have a nice weight when I use them!"
I like that it is sturdy even though is silicone.
"Great product, very sturdy and clean up well. Very heat resistant."
"They are great, handy, reliable and do the job! 10/10 recommend"
"They are sturdy silicone spatulas, but they are too thick to get under whatever needs to be flipped. No matter what I've tried to use the for (eggs, pancakes, burgers, grilled cheese, etc.) I can't slide it underneath. That makes these pretty useless."
"Sturdy, well made and easy to clean."
This is perfect on non stick cookware!
"While well constructed, the tip is too thick, the rake angle (look it up) too great for the blade to get under the food to lift or flip. I may grind down the tip to keep my easy overs from becoming scrambled."
Awesome! I would definitely buy again.
It's a little difficult to get under eggs or pancakes to flip them over. They are sturdy and the design is nice.
"Very happy with these so far!! Wish they made them in half the size, I use smaller pans for cooking and it's a bit awkward to use. Love the color and durability."
"I really like these spatulas, however, I wish they were a bit thinner at the end to make getting under an egg or pancake in order to flip it easier. Great otherwise."
They do the job but not the best to flip pancakes. The lip of the turner is a little too thick making it more difficult to flip.
"Still need to be cook with them, but they arrived in good condition and look very sturdy."
"They run a bit on the small side, but they are very heat resistant and work quite well."
This 2 piece spatula set is great. The blue color matches my kitchen. Works great in the frying pan
They are bigger than I expected.
"I bought these spatulas for my nonstick pans and they work great! The only reason I took away a star is because I ordered the rose gold ones and the silicone part in the pictures looked pinkish, but when I got them, they‚Äôre actually gray which was slightly disappointing. Other than that, they‚Äôre good and what I was looking for!"
"It‚Äôs a spatula and does spatula things very well, unless my husband is cooking but that is most likely user error."
I have only used the spatula a few times and it has already cracked on one corner. Very disappointed! I really liked the spatula before I noticed the crack.
Bought it in December and it is already chipped. Only used to flip pancakes or fish.
Great length and very sturdy
Handles are a bit too long.
Great product
""
So far this set is working out wonderfully!
Too bulky to use for flipping eggs or the like. It can flip thick items but not what you want for everyday use.
Well worth it!!! Durable and affordable
Kinda pricey but there okay.
Good product
Made food removal easy. The blue spatula was easier to get under the food.
I really wanted to love this set of spatulas but after using the solid one less than a handful of times it chipped along the edge. They feel nice and study and seemed like an upgrade from my last set until this happened.
Great for scrambled eggs
"This product, imm0d!um ‚Ç¨aps, 2oo c0unt is h@lf pr!‚Ç¨e on the!r web$!te."
Too thick make it hard to flip eggs. Could be good for something‚Äôs but they are too big and clunky for me.
Made cheap in my opinion flipping pancakes broke it just with a few uses. If it was solid all the way through with the metal just being decretive it would be a good spatula.
"Typically when I'm shopping around for kitchenware here I expect to be pretty disappointed. Either the item is super cheaply-made and falls apart, or it's way smaller than expected and largely useless. That said, I'm incredibly satisfied with this spatula set! Each item is a single-piece design with no gaps, which means that there's no crevices for bacteria to fester and all sorts of other things that make me uneasy lol. On top of that, this also means that there's no need to disassemble/assemble as part of cleaning or storage. My previous spatulas all had removable heads, which at first seems pretty cool, but then over time I realized that cleaning them is a pain, drying them properly is even worse, they are full of gaps for crud to accumulate and trigger my inner germaphobe, and on top of all THIS, some of them have worn over time and have actually come loose while I'm cooking with them, which is certainly NOT a desirable outcome! So yeah, being a single-piece design is a HUGE deal for me, and these spatulas accomplish that perfectly!  Another feature that I'm very pleased with is the design of the spatulas. I grew up with the type of spatulas that red and orange models in this set are, but I had no idea what I was missing until I'd used the others. The purple and teal spatulas are sort of concave, and curve inward, so they have this flexible lip around them which is great for scooping sauces and liquids and stuff, and the little blue spatula is a fancy knife/spreader that is actually really handy for spreading sauces or whatever evenly.  I haven't owned these for too long, so I can't give a long-ranging opinion on durability, but so far I've used them a ton and they're holding up without any trouble, and they haven't melted or weakened under normal use. I would say that for the price, it's absolutely worth at least giving them a try!"
"Love the bright red color. Good quality, flexible and easy to wash. I had bought the other set @walmart and worked pretty good until I realized mold was growing inside the spatula!! I was so grossed out ü§Æ I immediately got them out of my kitchen. (See pictures) This new set seems to be made of a strong silicone, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I would not recommend anyone to buy these. They are cheaply made, and upon the first use I noticed metal popping from the silicone. I immediately called Amazon and requested a full refund. The ones at the Dollar Store are better quality and hold up longer if you're looking for an inexpensive spatula."
"For a particular task, a spatula may be the wrong size or shape. This set solves the problem, and they're easy to clean.  Washing silicone rubber with dish detergent may leave an oily film. With a squirt of cleaner containing borax or washing soda (maybe a tablespoon per quart of water), silicone will rinse squeaky clean, and I can put a spatula right back on its hook.  They clean food out of pans, jars, and cans, for less waste and an easier cleanup. I get extra servings of peanut butter, and the jar is easier to wash if I want to reuse it.  Cream of mushroom soup will boil over quickly. One day I used a spatula instead of a metal spoon to stir it on medium heat. Something came up. Expecting to be right back, I left the spatula in the pan.  It may have been half an hour later when I remembered the soup. It hadn't boiled over. Somehow, the spatula was causing the bubbles to collapse. What's more, the handle didn't feel hot."
I was looking for silicone spatulas to use for cooking on my non-stick pans. These are more like you would use for spreading condiments or frostings. The two larger ones are barely larger than my flat ware. They also get a haze in the dishwasher that is difficult to remove because they are textured.
"Not sure how much one can write about a spatula that would help anyone decide if this is a good choice. They work as expected - :) The different sizes are handier than I would have expected and the colors oddly enough are helpful when I'm looking through the drawer hunting ""that"" one. The quality is good although I've only been using them for a short time they show no signs of wear or fatigue. They clean up well even hand washing and don't appear to be affected by the high-temp dishwasher cycle. overall - quite pleased with the purchase."
"Love these. I'm replacing my W&S spatulas that have wooden handles and can't be placed into the dishwasher. These are completely silicone so they can easily go in to the dishwasher without having to separate the handle. I was particularly excited to add the jar spatula to my inventory and finally got to use it today to squeegee out the last bit of nutella from the bottom and sides of the jar. It worked perfectly and is one of those things that i didn't know i needed until i got one. Also, i like the vibrant and mixed colors, again to replace my clear W&S ones which have gotten dingy in appearance. Each spatula is specialized for different functions. I probably use the spoonula the most for cooking but the smaller ones are good for mixing sourdough starter, which i do regularly so it's good to have a couple of spatulas on hand. And, great price. Very happy with this purchase."
So far I like them. Will edit my review if something changes. I like them because they are one piece and the price was pretty good for five. I have a couple where the ends actually come off and they mold underneath and you have to use a toothpick to clean them. (Those did not come from Amazon). Will be throwing them out now that I have replaced them. Some of these are longer and that is nice for jars.
"These silicone utensils were just what I needed in the kitchen. So far they have held up to heat and regular use. I have only hand washed them so I do not know how they would stand up to regularly running them through the dishwasher. As for heat, I've used them stir, scrape and dish out hot food from hot pans. I do not leave them in the pan or lay them on hot pans. I am happy with my purchase, especially for the daily deal price I paid and love the bright colors. No issues with wires breaking through either. I would recommend to others."
"I wondered to self: ‚Äòdo i really need any more silicone kitchen equipment?‚Äô. But was drawn to these by their colour/varying functionality and price. Glad I did. I use them daily. Different sizes. Different shapes for different purposes. Just last night I realised I could actually use one for a spoon to serve. It was deep enough. And wouldn‚Äôt, of course, scratch the non stick container. The smaller ones are good in the air fryer. Wish they did tongs also.... Am tempted to buy a few sets as gift for friends. Bet they‚Äôve got some odd ones lying around, as I had, they are now donated. I certainly intend ordering another set for us for the cabin! Simply don‚Äôt want to be without. They became old friends within a week!"
"I had been looking for a new heat resistant spatula (I'm a little picky about my kitchen items) and saw this set. I decided to give it a try. I love them so much I ordered a set for my daughter! She loves them too! There is a spatula for every job and the smaller ones are great for getting the last bit out of a can. They also sturdy and hold up to heat even when my husband uses them! I would have liked all one color but I discovered that I like the different ones. They are bright, don't stain and clean up is easy!"
"These work very well for my purpose, mostly preparing baked goods for personal use. I especially like the straight spatula, which I use like a knife for cutting singly layer cakes. Not as sturdy or thin as a metal knife, but does not cause damage to aluminum pan surfaces. Nothing sticks to any of these spatulas so they are a breeze to keep clean, and they dry almost instantly with no spotting after rinsing in hot water. I'm well pleased with my purchase."
"The Hotec silicone spatula set arrived on time and in good repair. Even before I opened the package I could feel the weightiness of the content. I was very pleased with each spatula, particularly with how the ones used for mixing and stirring has a spoon like quality to them. Their size are substantial and they are good and hefty. Unlike some reviewers, I enjoy using the cake spatula the most and not for just icing cakes since I am not a baker. Overall this spatula set has been and excellent buy."
"I bought this for the small spatula in the set and thought if the others were any good then it would be a bonus. The small spatula was just the size I needed and my wife immediately started using the bigger spatula and ""spoon"" spatula and then threw out two of our old ones. They feel very sturdy and have nice stiff, but flexible ends on them and the red color is a nice muted red. we were pleasantly surprised."
"I recently received some Gotham Steel cookware and did not want to damage the cooking surfaces, so I purchased these and they are great. I can spread butter and mayo on bread for toast or sandwiches, can scramble eggs, and stir in my pots with no fear.  P.S. tThe price was great."
I began to cook with rubber spatulas rather than regular cooking utensils and ran into these after I accidentally melted a non-heat resident spatula of mine while making scrambled eggs. These are super great ‚Äîseemingly high quality at an affordable price. Packaging was a little challenging ‚Äî they were packaged separately and kept clinging to the plastic as I was taking them out. Will likely buy another set to have as spare because I‚Äôve been using them for EVERYTHING!
I have bought several spatulas and this is the best set I have found. Great at scraping bowls while baking and even spreading cakes. Food doesn‚Äôt stick to them and you can simply rinse them off but they are dishwasher safe and a great price for a set that will fulfill all your needs.
"Unlike the ones with the wooden handles that seem to slip off when I‚Äôm mixing after some age and use, these are one piece! I go through several a day so having a bunch is a must! They stir scrambled eggs, fry my onions for my chili, scrape the pots, mix my nuts into cookies‚Ä¶..the list goes on and on! Just suck it up and buy them! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
"These are the silicon spatulas I've been looking for. I was tired of all the others that have handles that separate from the blades because all kinds of gook and mold gets in between the handle and the blade. But with these spatulas, the silicon encapsulates both handle and blade so no where for the gook to go! Another plus is the extra long handle on 2 of them and a thin version for narrow openings. Highly recommend."
"These spatulas replaced my older set of wooden handled and plastic handled spatulas with rubber ""spoons"" on the end which would come off and/or melt in high heat. There are 5 sizes and shapes. Besides being very lightweight and sturdy, they are super easy to clean--simply place them on the top rack of the dishwasher."
"I love everything about this set of spatulas because they are one solid piece and not a handle with a spatula head on it because I find that food and water gets inside of the spatula head and you have to remove it to clean it or else it can mold, yuck. These spatulas are also not too stiff or limber so they can handle wiping stiff mashed potatoes out of a pan but not too limber too really swipe the pan clean. The set has the perfect size and assortment of utensils and you can‚Äôt get these in a store for this price!"
"I absolutely love these. I practically use them for everything now from cooking with to baking and icing a cake. When you use them to scrape a bowl, can, jar or pan they do a very good job ""scraping"". They do well with heat and are very easy to clean. Thank you!"
"I have been looking for a versatile set of spatulas that are also heat resistant. I ordered these and am very happy with them. I have had others that are heat resistant, but they seem to be a little heavy and awkward to use. These are perfect. There is a great variety of sizes and uses for them. I use at least one of then every day and love them. I ended up buying a set for my daughter too!"
I thought that silicone would be flimsy and could melt easily. Read up on silicone utensils and found that they are far more heat resistant and easily cleaned. So I ordered these to see for myself. They are great. Seeing is believing. We are very pleased with them.
"I really wanted that blue spurtle thing. I've been watching the infomercials on tv and thought I'd try something like this that can go through the dishwasher without worrying about wood cracking from use. I cook a lot. The spurtle thing is fine. I might buy a set with a bigger spurtle thing. The other utensils are really handy and getting plenty of use though I already had a ton of those things for cooking. For the price, this is a YES."
I LOVE these spatulas and scrappers. I use them for cooking everything. The spatulas have a little bit of a scoop that works great for spooning sauces and they don‚Äôt melt (I‚Äôve left them in sauce pans while cooking but not in fry pans with hot grease.) I highly recommend. I purchased multiple sets to have multiple colors and because I knew I would use them so much.
"We have had these for a couple months now. We use them almost every day. Having the different sizes is nice for certain things, but honestly, I find myself reaching for the larger ones most of the time. They don't scratch pans and you don't have to worry about the handles melting. You can scrape the bottom of bowls and pans clean throw them in a dishwasher. Great buy."
These are easily worth more than the purchase price. Easy to clean since they are completely covered in silicone. No little spots for old food bits to get down between the wood/metal and silicone business end of other brands I‚Äôve used. This is a easy recommendation!
"These are sturdier than the $1 store and $2 ones at Walmart, better made and have lasted 6 months so far without cracking."
"These Spatula's ARE EXCELLENT Spatula's to use in any cooking, serving, etc., They are sturdy and easy to clean. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to Any/All whenever a Spatula is needed in any process."
"I love these spatulas because of the variety. I especially love the long, narrow one for getting the remaining salad dressing or peanut butter from the container. No more waste."
"I ordered the multi-color set as I had read reviews about the white spots on the black and red, and thought maybe the multi-color wouldn't get them as bad. I don't find them a problem at all so far. There a few faint ones but it's not an issue. They are a little flimmsy at the tip as I also read, but not a big deal either. Very happy so far."
"If you've ever considered getting spatulas like this grab this set. We are constantly cooking here, for family and testing cookbook recipes for authors and this set is a steal. Super useful and easy clean up."
I love these They say they‚Äôre dishwasher safe but I won‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher again. It left a film over the spoon
"I should have purchased these much sooner. Better than old style with a wood handle. It won‚Äôt come off, and it won‚Äôt get mold. Easy cleaning. I like the bonus mini spatula. Perfect for Mayo or any spread to make a sandwich."
Variety of sizes and useful for hot or cold foods. I like that they are entirely made of silicon. I have another set with bamboo handles and the handles split. This set seems much sturdiers. I would buy again.
Different sizes for different applications. Very sturdy and firm on the interior yet flexible and supple on the exterior. One of the best purchases I‚Äôve made in the past year without question.
I just bought these for the skinnier ones so that I can get the last little bit of the mayonnaise. They do they job and are easy to clean up.
I got tired of having my silicone spatula head come off the handle. Problem solved with these one piece silicone spatula set. One piece construction.... what a great idea.
I had a similar set that had removable tops. Food always got stuck in the crease of the top. These are all one piece and no creases. Very easy to clean - no places for food to hide. I would buy again.
"Some have a lip around the perimeter making it efficient in getting hard to reach mayo, mustard and other things. Initially felt they were too small but after using them I adore them and bought a set for my daughter who loves them too."
Sturdy. All one piece each. Not coming apart when you wash them. They get the job done and the different sizes are a huge plus. Would recommend.
I normally don't care for silicone anything but I really like these with my nonstick cookware. The long one is ideal for getting the last if the mayo out of the jar.
"I first saw this at my SIL's house and fell in love with these spatulas! I always thought the small skinny ones never served a purpose but I used that one too! I love that it's all silicone so there's no parts to remove when washing to avoid mold. Super easy to clean, flexible tops but sturdy handles, love the color! So glad I bought these!"
These are good sturdy spatulas. Pretty too. I love the ones with corner feature for getting all my egg cooked in the pan. It lets me scramble like a pro.
"They seem very well-made, are extremely easy to clean and have just the right amount of firmness/flexibility. Now we‚Äôll have to see how long they hold up."
"No matter what I use these spatulas on, it washes right off when I want it to. I would buy these again, very good price."
You don‚Äôt know how much you need these until you get them. They‚Äôre small and can reach in small spaces and crevices. Super handy.
"nice color - as shown, solid handles and rigid enough in the handle but flexible at the spatula end. Nice compact size, not oversized, useful for my smaller cooking projects, for my camping/hotel hot plate travel plans too"
"Love the ""one piece"" spatulas, on my old ones the plastic handle would break off after a while but these are ""one piece"", they are sturdy, fun colors, easy to clean for a lot less money than what I paid for my old spatulas."
These spatulas have a comfortable feel when working with them. They are protecting my Fatbrware non stick skillets from scratches. Red color contrasts with most kitchen items; especially the red Kitchen-Aid stand mixer. I'm ordering another set as a small gift item.
Great spatulas for a variety of uses. Good quality and I did not notice a strange smell or taste as other people have complained about. The turquoise color is fantastic and looks awesome with my red kitchen.
"Perfect set for multiple applications. Spatula is sturdy and feels like high quality. It is not flimsy like some plastic spatula. So far good. Can't comment of longevity yet, but if breaks easy will definitely update the review"
"These are smaller than expected, but gets the work done. Middle firmness, not super soft. I reach for other soft spatula set to scrap out fluffy egg whites and to fold. These are great for thicker batters like cupcake."
Purchased these on a ‚Äúdeal of the day‚Äù so the price I paid for what I got was great. I‚Äôve used all of these now and they‚Äôre all sturdy and clean very easily. Would purchase as a housewarming gift as I think they will last.
They are just stiff enough to work perfectly. With the different sizes I use them for everything. Very easy to clean.
"I love these they are more sturdy than I thought the would be, I use mine for scrambled eggs and to mix batter etc, I also put in the dishwasher and they seem to be holding up good. I would recommend these, specially since you have different sizes."
"I liked the one piece construction and the bright colors. If you want to hang them, they have a suitable hole in the end of the handle. Great value!"
"I love this spatula set. It covers everything you might need a spatula for in the kitchen, of all shapes and sizes. Recommended!"
I love these spatulas. I bake a lot and these are perfect. I threw away my old ones. I have used them all. The thin one is great for emptying out jars and bottles of mustard or jam.. or frosting cakes!! I love them.
"I have used these for cleaning out containers, stirring sourdough starter, cooking and mixing all things."
Just received these this afternoon. Looks great and sturdy. Feels comfortable holding. Will update once we've tested them out.
These tools are real workhorses in the kitchen. Easy to use and clean up in the dishwasher or by hand. You will be surprised how handy they are.
My niece had these spatulas & I enjoyed the versatility with the various sizes! Also enjoy the punch of color they provide. Thoroughly enjoying these spatulas.
Don't know how I lived without these sturdy silicone spatulas. Prolongs the life of your non-stick fry pan surface.
"I'm really happy that I came across these. They are heat resistant and I love them. The sturdiness of them is great as well because now I don't have to worry about it possibly breaking. Overall, a good product and I'm happy that I came across them when I did. It is exactly what I was looking for."
I bought these to use with my countertop appliances they're much sturdier than others I've had. Price was great too.
Product came in just like the images shown. They are heat resistant and work well on syrups and nut butters! No signs of ripping off either. These are great spatulas and the variety of shapes and sizes is great!
"Good quality and work great. They aren't silky smooth, they have a nice non-slip texture making them easy to hold onto. Nice rich color that is consistent throughout, I'm not expecting them to fade. Haven't had any problems in the dishwasher. I would purchase them again and recommend."
love these. the variety of shapes is quite handy. they fit comfortably in my hand and clean up easily.
"Just about perfect. Better than any other I've tried. For people that are having trouble with egg yolks breaking, three things:  1) Be sure to get BOTH sides of the flipper coated wirh grease before you touch an egg with it.  2) Make sure the egg has cooked, on the bottom, sufficiently before trying to flip it.  3) Give the pan a little jiggle to make sure the eggs are moving easily in the pan and have some grease under them.  Then, gently slide the flipper under the egg and turn it over. If you're trying to be healthy and not use grease, forget everything I've said and scramble your eggs."
"This turner is perfect for any level of cooking. The product arrived quickly and has served as the grilled cheese god! It‚Äôs not only a turner but a thin nylon flexible spatula as well. I‚Äôve used other good brands of cooking utensils (T-Fal, Martha stewart etc.) and paid an arm and a leg for my last thin non stick spatula and this oxo one is a a steal. You can see the size in the images. It‚Äôs small, flexible, and hangs up nicely. This is by far my favorite brand cookware as a novice cook and wife of a chef. My husband and I both use oxo as it truly is a neutral brand for all ranges of cooking expertise. It‚Äôs affordable and their utensils last forever. Plus cleaning = easy.  If you‚Äôre tired of surface damage to your food caused by not having the right non stick tools you need this product in your kitchen. Now I have a reason to brag, I have The best grilled cheese on the block. This has been a life goal of mine, I think we can all agree it‚Äôs hard to master a good grilled cheese.  If you want to make your spatula last - even though it‚Äôs dishwasher safe I recommend hand washing it. I also recommend using it with only high end or oxo brand pots and pans. When I use my oxo products together they never get scuffed up.  The stainless steel metal bar connecting the head of the spatula to the firm grip absorbs the heat excellent. It can definitely handle temperatures over 400 degrees but if you want to keep it from damage don‚Äôt go over 400 degrees. It‚Äôs safe and doesn‚Äôt overheat.  this tool is perfect for cooking and baking and the thin flexible nylon turner head turns hard to flip foods into works of art. No broken eggs, crepes, pancakes, or cookies! Right around the holiday? This is a must for baking.  I did use it on a non stick pan and it didn‚Äôt scratch my pan but given the feel of the nylon spatula head it probably would have scratched it if I wasn‚Äôt careful. Again it‚Äôs easy to clean and maintain, I personally recommend only using brands like oxo In your kitchen, I‚Äôve found cooking food with all the cookware from the same brand increases the quality of your food and preserves your cookware for YEARS. This brand is high end but also extremely fair on price.  + fast arrival + thin and small, comfortable grip + no surface damage to your grilled cheese + Grilled cheese master + small with comfy grip + heat absorber so it‚Äôs safe  Besides the stickers on the product being hard to get off, this product is a must for everyone in the kitchen."
"I am very disappointed. The edge of the turner has melted even using in a nonstick pan on nothing more than medium heat (and melted material got into food). Also, the handle began to melt when briefly in contact with pan edge. The turner is flimsy and food sticks to it. It is not easy to clean. I expected better quality from OXO as previous products were good."
"I have used dozens of non-stick spatulas over the past five decades, and this is by far the best. a dog literally chewed up the one I've used for 15 years now, so I bought two to replace it in case it ends up no longer being made. even with the dog chewings, it was still the best one.... my 80 lb chocolate lab chewed and chewed on it and deformed the middle of it a little bit.  I point that out because this is the only spatula, aside from the larger version of the same one, that wasn't eventually deformed or chewed up on the end by hot griddles, as has been the nearly immediate case with every other non-stick spatula brand I have owned. so, it has been the most consistent egg flipper.  that's really a huge statement given that it is thin enough to actually flip an egg, and more durable than spatulas three times as thickness"
"I have a number of Oxo grip equipment already in the kitchen. I like them for their handles and over all quality. When my old spatula had got to the point it had seen better days it was a no brainer to choose this...Not only was it an Oxo grip by the price on it was very fair...I received it within 3 days, (with prime shipping) and used it that night with some fried mushrooms and onions, as well as the next morning for breakfast. Though it makes a very nice spatula over all, I do have a couple of things that I noticed right off. One is it being really short. Probably not the best choice for a spatula or anything kicking up a lot of grease. Also, the actual spatula part is very thin...You can easily bend it and its not thick at all. But its strong enough for you to easily use on most fried things, and, its thinness is actually an asset for really getting underneath something thin, or stuck on. And one last thing...This was curved a little to much for me on arrival...I mean the bend in it was so sharp it made it a little too much for me being so short. Fortunately you can just get a good grip on it and bend it straighter which made in my opinion made it better...Overall a nice, quality spatula that carries a very fair price. Maybe a little thinner and shorter than I expected but its turned out to well do the job its supposed too...Recommended.."
"This is my second one, first one cracked after more than a decade of near daily use.  It is made of nylon, so it will melt at high temperature (but scrape the melty gunk off the edge with a sharp knife and it is fine). I have only run into the melting issue a few times, always with much higher heat than I normally use (searing steak, making smash burgers). It is something to be aware of, but it does not come up in 99% of situations.  It is very flexible, wide enough for big things and has rounded corners to use on little things. Does not scrape non stick coatings too.  Handle is comfortable, material and shape make it easy to clean.  I have used silicone spatulas as well and they don't stand up they way this one does (start to develop small cracks at leading edge). So I am not even sure a temperatie resistant non scratch version can be made. There is one with exactly the same shape but the turner is a flexible metal."
"I saw this spatula highly recommended by TheKitchn.com, and it was cheap enough that I thought I'd give it a try. I was concerned with how short it was, but it got such a glowing review that if nothing else it would make a good backup spatula. It turns out the shorter length makes it easier to use, especially with the metal rods connecting the handle with the spatula itself. I can control how I pick things up and flip them better with the shorter length, although I've noticed a few times I had a little trouble getting a burger turned over but that's probably more to my own dexterity. I've dinged it for cleaning because a couple of times I've washed it and noticed grease left behind. I'm not sure why that happened, but it wasn't a big deal to give it a second washing, and that happens all the time with my glass lids."

"Pros: 1. Thin spatula so you‚Äôre able to get under your food better for flipping. ie: over easy eggs, pancakes, etc. 2. Because it‚Äôs thin it‚Äôs more versatile 3. Heavy duty Handle w/ metal body makes it more sturdy  Cons: None  I personally buy several and cut them so they are more pan/food friendly: Little pans 8‚Äù I like a smaller spatula so I cut with scissors the same pattern only about 1‚Äù shorter. Not necessary. I just personally prefer to flip eggs when the spatula part fits in smaller pans or bigger ones that are the size of the product I am flipping."
"When it first arrived, I thought the handle was going to be too short. However, this little spatula is perfect. The head is narrow and slides easily under food and is non-stick. I did order this following Cook's Illustrated recommendations, and I am very happy with it. I would order it again or even as a gift for a foodie who cooks. Only caveat -- It could melt if you don't treat it responsibly so don't leave it sitting in a pan when the stove eye is on. Use that spoon rest. Trust me!"
"Regardless of pan-size, THIS is the tool I prefer for cooking FRIED EGGS. I do prefer to use small pans for frying 1 or 2 eggs and I might have more than one pan going at the same time. SO, with the small pan-size in-Mind, the blade is the perfect size for the job AND its THIN, heat-resistant material glides right under the egg making it easy to pick-up and flip or simply serve it/them to a plate. I just can't seem to flip eggs IN THE PAN, so I gotta have a tool that works for me. THIS IS IT. Now... a word about HEAT RESISTANCE... the blade resists the effects of heat very well, HOWEVER the HANDLE doesn't resist as well. Note that it advertises that its heat resistant - hot heat PROOF. I've melted some spots on the handle because I wasn't paying enough attention. OOPS! I gladly ordered another one so all's well again. SO, just be careful... don't lay the tool in the pan so the edge of the pan can melt the rubber handle material... and YOU'LL LOVE THIS TOOL! Enjoy."
One of two of my favorites! It is 100% everything they said it is. It has flex it can lift a heavy burger and yet get under a fried egg and flip it without breaking. It is easy to clean and nice to hold. The length is long enough and creates a great balance in your hand to make cooking easy. The rounded edges are tapered from the center to the edge making it simple to scrap around the pan or dish. I can easily get under bacon and flip them too.
"Another great product from OXO! It's my new favorite, easy to use and clean.  I see, that, there are several reviews complaining about it melting - ludicrous!  It's made of NYLON you can NOT leave it your pan because it will melt, duh!  Use it and remove from your pan, if you can't do this, then I suggest you purchase a metal turner."
"I had this product for Year's! The spatula part is red. It is still as nice as the day it was purchased and that was 18-19 years ago. It gets every day use. I am putting together a "" my first home package"" for the kitchen. I am buying all the item's I feel a starter cook need's for success. This is one of the item's I feel will help with that success. Eggs, omelets, burgers. If it needs turning or lifting, this spatula holds up!"
"Great turner.... very small size compared to the one I bought in the store.  I have a turner that looks and acts just like this one, except that the one that I bought in the store is about twice this size. I will keep this turner as this size might be very handy, but truly I didn't even know they made this size. I have reread the product description and I don't see any measurements. The size of this was a surprise. Still I really like the larger one and am assuming that that this will work just the same."
I came to Amazon to replace these spatulas that I bought at the grocery store several years ago. Very easy to clean (dishwasher safe) and great on non-stick pans. I bought two because I use one nearly every day for everything from scrambling eggs to serving baked chicken breasts. My daughter left one on the cooktop too long and the edge melted. Then I noticed the other was showing wear. I had them probably 5 years so I consider that a reasonable lifespan for a plastic spatula. Just remember not to let them rest on the cooktop or in the pan.
"Recently both my husband and I had been struggling flipping over easy eggs w/out breaking them and we were simply getting frustrated with ourselves. This didn't use to be an issue. Anyway, we moved, thought we lost a spatula so I bought this one. Told my husband it was supposed to be ""made for"" egg flipping. You should have heard him scream with excitement when he first used it. Needless to say, it works beautifully and we're back to perfectly flipped eggs. Now we find ourselves trying to understand why this utensil works so much better than the last. (smile)"
"I basically use this for fried eggs and have tried many spatulas over the years, but this is the best by far. Because of its thinness and flexibility it easily slides underneath even the most delicate food items without causing crumbling/breaking or folding of the food. Another great feature is the short handle which helps to control the flipping and turning over of eggs, pancakes etc. The spatula is also very easy to clean and is the second one I bought because if two people are cooking at the same time, they both want this particular spatula."
"I've used this several times now and like the flexibility of the blade portion and that the handle can rest on the side of the pan without melting. In a standard fry pan, this is the size I keep reaching for because it's just the right size. I did order the larger slotted turner made by oxo as well. I wanted something that would drain oil when deeper frying. Great brand, great tools."
I have been looking for a super thin spatula & this is it. It's sturdy & flexible along with being very thin to get under your food to flip. Other spatulas have been too thick making it hard to get under many types of food. I use it almost everyday & it looks like new. I will purchase again when this one wears out.
"I have yet to be disappointed with any Oxo products that I‚Äôve purchased and this one also gets high marks. They can be a little more expensive than others out there but I think it‚Äôs worth it for the quality. Be careful when you take off the tag that is around the handle as I had to use a knife to get it off. Also, when considering this item it sits a little higher in a drawer than most."
"While I have just used this spatula once so it is improper to say if it is heat resistance, the only way I would know is if I left it sitting in a sizzling hot pan for too long and saw it start to melt! Who does that? It looks strong enough and it doesn't transfer heat into the handle, so it does a good job of turning burgers! I did think it was going to be larger, but it's perfect for burgers on non-stick pans!"
"I am a big fan of this kitchen product. It is great since we have primarily non-stick pots and pans. This is my go to tool when anything needs flipping in the kitchen. I left an old one of these at a vacation house and when I noticed after getting home, I immediately ordered another. Would highly recommend for use on non-stick pans."
"I love that this spatula is thin. It's slightly flexible for flipping eggs and pancakes, but sturdy enough for flipping wontons and scraping french fries from the pan (I bake my fries). I'm so impressed, I plan to purchase a few more. The handle stays cool and the length is on perfect for 12""-14"" pans, not too long and definitely not too short. Strongly recommend as the PERFECT spatula."
"Love it! New, cleans easily, and works great for my Green Pans. Typically, I don't dishwasher pots and pans (washed by hand), but I do dishwasher utensils. This cleans up nicely, and has a great angle--easy to move food. Very solid. It works as described on delicate fish meat (or any other food); salmon fillet stayed together moving from cookware to dinner plate. It has a very fine (thin) edge, which is super when trying to slide underneath food. I will buy some more. I prefer the black, but they have other colors, too. It's be great if they had a larger (longer version) for those larger food items. They might! I didn't check."
"I did not have an electric griddle when I first used this product. I used it for flipping pancakes in a skillet on my gas top stove. Thus, the spatula shows a little melting on the edge. I don't think it was designed for a gas top as my ability to control the temperature of the heat is not the same as with an electric griddle."
"I much prefer the shorter handled flippers and this one from Oxo is very nice. Obviously you don't want to leave the handle lying against a hot pan, it is a plastic product afterall! Nice wide lip, perfect for pancakes!"
"I was hesitant to spend so much on a pancake flipper, so over time I bought two other spatulas to try to avoid having to pay for this, but finally ended up splurging because you can't match the quality, sturdiness, thin-ness, etc. of this flipper. We received our first as a wedding present 14 years ago and it is still going strong. We bought the second for our camper."
"I've pretty much used this exclusively for fried eggs, works great. It CAN have some sticking issues with the edges, but it isn't often. Also, I can't remember if mine had it, but a relative got this same product and it had a sticker on it that took a good 15 minutes of scraping with sticker remover just to get it fully clean. Made no sense why anyone would add a sticker like that to a cooking utensil on a part that is going to be used to touch food. OXO should know better than that in the first place."
"My new favorite spatula for turning eggs. Thin and flexible, can work a little bit like a rubber spatula, but strong enough to get under and lift foods. Not the spatula for chopping things in the pan or browning ground meat, of course. :) No vents or slots means easy cleanup - just wipe it off!"
"Hesitant to buy this even with the quality OXO name because of the negative reviews on melting and weak flipping action. No problems on either account. Some cooks leave the spatula in pan upside down for convenience; not good, eventually even titanium will suffer. It won't flip a 48 ounce T-bone on the grill...wrong tool."
"I really like these thin spatulas. They are great for cookies or eggs. I wore out a pair that I purchased 5yrs ago, and need to order replacements. They clean easily if you wipe them off after use, and wash by hand. I learned it's best not to put them in dishwasher. They are my favorite go to spatula."
I ordered this by mistake but I have to say this turner is great! I had one I threw out because the heat would fry the front edge and wanted a silicone one. So far no crimped edges!! Does have food stick on edge of turner but it cleans easier than the other one I had. OXO never disappoints!!
"This is the third or fourth one of these I've owned - I love them. The size is perfect - not too big, not too small. I like the flexibility of the paddle itself - it's perfect for eggs. I did rate 4 stars for heat resistance - the edges will melt if you don't watch it. However, normal usage, it's fine."
I bought one of these about 5 years ago and it has served me well. I use it all the time. My husband bought me a larger sturdier black spatula because he said we needed two. It cracked after two years. I just ordered 3 more of these OXO Good Grips Spatulas so my husband doesn‚Äôt feel the need to by more that won‚Äôt last. I still have my original one too. They are easy on Teflon and you can flip an egg with ease.
"I use it for turning pancakes. It works great. The blade is nylon or plastic, so I don't leave it against the hot griddle very long, but I've had no problem with it. Like other OXO products I use, it's beautifully made. Looks and feels great."
My cast iron pan that I have used for many years suddenly showed scratches. I discovered it was from my metal spatula. I purchased this shortly after Christmas. Scratches have disappeared!
"I've been looking for months in local stores for these Oxo flexible turners, I've had a number of them over the past 15 years. Very thin so easy to turn delicate things, like over easy eggs, without breaking. I'm hard on my tools, constant use, eventually these can split a tiny bit on an edge if you flex them a lot for a long time. Worth the money, I now have three so I don't have to wash after every use, just toss in dishwasher."
I use this spatula for breakfast scrambled eggs and just everything for turning and flipping food from breakfast to dinner. It has a good springing action and adheres to food to flip it or turn it. Best spatula that I ever cooked with.
Husband doesn't like it's flexibility but I'm the usual cook and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for as all my other non-stick spatulas were so thick and stiff it was very difficult to turn over anything delicate like egg or fish. This is perfect! Would buy again.
"I like the size. It's shorter than what I was expecting. I use it to make pancakes and remove cookies from the cookie sheet. I have noticed it does need extra cleaning when used to make scrambled eggs. Overall, very satisfied."
Good Grips is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù for well made ergonomic household items. This little spatula is be exception. Great for moving cookies from the baking tray to the cooling rack. But also nice whenever I need a small spatula. Well made. Easy to use. Easy to clean.
"I LOVE this spatula!! It is made out of a very thin hard plastic. It is so so thin, unlike many of the plastic spatulas I‚Äôve owned, very easy to slide under sandwiches, omelets, etc. I love that it won‚Äôt scratch my pans but still offers all the benefits of a metal spatula."
"Perfect for pancakes and cookies, my old spatula was so thick it could get under things. This one is perfect. My pan doesn't even move you can perfectly get under cookies."
Bought a really nice pan so needed tools to be gentle on the surface. I can still manage to heat damage any product but really happy with this!!!
"My old spatula wore out and I needed a new one to use with my non-stick frying pans. I needed one large enough to flip eggs, but not too large, and this one is the perfect size. I've used it 2 months now and it is nice and flexible enough for eggs, hash browns or pancakes. Cleans up well and looks like it will last a long time."
"This pancake turner/spatula/whatever you want to call it, works well. It probably will melt if you try to cook it by leaving it in a hot pan or on a griddle, but if you use it as it was designed to be used, you will have no problems.  Recommended"
I like that this is almost soft. It bends easily so you do not think it will ruin the bottom of your pans. But if you are looking for hard this is not for you.
"I just bought this for my daughter because I've had the same one for years. It's my go-to cooking spatula, the one I prefer to use. It's a perfect size. I've had mine forever and it still looks like new."
"This product works well for flipping eggs cooked over easy or over hard in a skillet. It comes clean in the top rack of the dishwasher. I haven't subjected it to high heat, so I can't say how it would ensure."
This is a great little spatula. I just bought the OXO griddle and needed a non metal spatula to use with it. This one is perfect.
It is firm and flexible and works great in tight places and doesn't loose its flex and is the best one I have ever bought. I bought a 2nd one to have in the case I loose the previous one.
"Our old kitchen-aid spatula finally bit the dust, so I was looking for an inexpensive replacement. I'm surprised by how well this good grips performs for the price. When it arrived, it looked very thin, but that actually makes it ideal for flipping pancakes. It seems very durable and has been really easy to clean. Doesn't scratch my pans. I will probably buy 2-3 more of these as I prefer it over the other thicker spatulas we have."
"This spatula is the perfect size for eggs pancakes omelets grilled sandwiches etc~ sturdy, comfortable to hold and just as wonderful as everything I have purchased from OXO~"
Absolutely my favorite spatula. I gotten one almost 10 years ago and fell in love with it. I've had two new ones since because one my son stole from me Lol üòÜ and the other got old.  They are great for getting underneath things and lifting them without interfering with something else in the pan excellent for pancakes eggs etc.
This size skillet is perfect for many different uses. Food slides off perfectly. Uniform cooking. My favorite skillet is this brand from now on.
Best turner in my house now I love how it easily slides under food and and then size is perfect for many things not to small or big.
I would highly recommend this spatula. Purchased two and they are both excellent quality. Hold up to heat well. Flexible and sturdy. Handle seems secured well. It is thinner than any other spatula I've owned so I find it especially helpful in that regard. Washes up easily. Overall great!
"Lightweight and just the right length for flipping burgers, fish, or eggs. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price."
"This is my second one, wore out the first after many years. I love the thin edge on this. It makes for easy slide under delicate things like fried eggs."
"Extremely thin and flexible, just what I was looking for. My mother had some very old/used spatulas that were older than me and after years of use on iron skillets their edges had been honed and sharpened to the point they could cut someone. Seriously. I liked using them in the kitchen, especially with omelettes because they could easily sweep beneath things in a skillet without tearing them like the thick, non-flexible metal ones. These remind me of my mother's spatulas so I got 2 for me (small and large) and the same for her.  Pros: thin (less than 1mm thick), flexible, multiple, sizes, rubber grip Cons: too flexible for some jobs"
"After using this for a few months, I discarded my heavy, clunky spatulas and ordered a 2nd one of these. They are thin and flexible, yet sturdy enough to lift medium pizza from pizza pan. Perfect for cooking and baking, and won‚Äôt damage my non-stick enamel pans."
"My husband & I have three or four of these! They really get underneath food or ingredients very well because it's so thin. Although it is thin it can hold a lot of weight. Browning hamburger needs another tool because it's a little too flexible. Perfect for baking, flipping things in the oven & getting between food and foil."
"Quite thin but sturdy. Flexible, wide enough surface. Good comfortable handle. Seems you could use this in the kitchen....and elsewhere."
"This is my most favorite spatula for most foods. It works well and will not damage non-stick coatings. I've used it for eggs, burgers, cookies, french toast, grilled cheese, etc I like the very thin but relatively strong blade that allows you to easily get under food to better flip it. The only real downside is that eggs have to be hand scrubbed off. It won't clean up nicely in the dishwasher if you make scrambled eggs with it. For me, this is not a huge issue. I would estimate that these spatulas last about 3 years (they get brittle and begin to crack)...this seems about right to me and I would buy a new one every 3 years unless I find something else with better durability."
I love this spatula! It‚Äôs perfect for making all types of eggs! I‚Äôm definitely going to order one or two more!
"Great product! This is my third of this spatula. I love the size and quality of this tool. My first two were inadvertently rested too long on a hot pan and deformed. Not a product fault, my own. It does have a slightly textured surface, so you really have to scrub it to get clean, but it‚Äôs worth the little extra time. It‚Äôs pretty sturdy and just the perfect size for our pans."
"I looked and looked to find a perfect SHORT and thin flexible spatula. I took this chance and have been thanking myself ever since. We actually find ourselves a bit peturbed in this household when we find somebody's gotten it used before we had our go. The good thing though, is it cleans up so easily and quickly, we unbristle and use it for our own purposes in 60 seconds. This is an item you will definitely want to buy in pairs. Thin, flexible yet wide enough for what ever your flippin!! Tip doesn't go all melty even in high temps like deeper fat (like cooking sausage links & patties)"
I recently ordered this product as a replacement and was not sure it was the Small (S) size. Fortunately it is the (S) size and is just perfect for eggs etc... You do have to be careful not to leave it on a hot burner !!! My Bad !!!
Great to use on non-stick pans and everything else. Even my husband commented on how much better it works than our old metal one. Flexibility makes this useful for many applications in the kitchen.
"I just received this wooden spoon yesterday. I haven't used it yet. I will update after washing and using it for a bit. This spoon is made out of one solid piece of beech wood. It has a natural oil finish. It is safe for non-stick cookware. It is hand wash only. This spoon is a tad over 8 inches long. The bowl of the spoon is 1 3/4 inches wide, 2 1/4 inches long and about 1 inch deep. This spoon has a flat bottom and does not roll. The first impression is this spoon is very lightweight which I like. The natural finish is beautiful. The one-piece beech wood is carved to perfection. Overall a lovely looking spoon. This spoon is replacing a 30-year-old wooden spoon that I loved. I used my old spoon several times a week. I can only hope this spoon holds up just as well."
I absolutely love this thing! Literally let‚Äôs me gut my lemons so well. If you like pulp this thing is a pulp machine! Definitely worth its money.
"Look elsewhere. The wood at the scooping end of the spoon started splitting after only two or three uses- did not leave it sitting in water or do anything else damaging to wood, just normal kitchen use. I have some wooden utensils that I've been using for nearly twenty years, have never split or cracked. Though I've generally been happy with OXO products, this one is a waste of money."
I used this spoon for less than a week and it split in 2 places. I put a couple layers of mineral oil on it beforehand to help moisture resistance and I didn't let it soak in water. Very disappointing because I have other OXO products that work great. Would not recommend.
"In my 50+ years of home cooking I've tried glass, plastic, ceramic and metal. This beechwood is far superior. Welcome back to the good old days! The particular shape of this cone is effective, handle easy to grasp, sharp point to dig into the lemon/lime, and nice deep troughs. But, BEST of all, the wooden edges are sharp and seem like they'll stay that way for a long time. To get the most juice out of a reluctant lime or lemon, I still rely on something else before reaming: Stab a couple of tiny holes in the rind (so the fruit won't explode); stick it in the micro for a minutes or less, and then roll it hard back and forth on the counter to break up the tissues inside. The good old dinner fork still works well in a pinch!"
"My husband decided to make cookies last weekend. (I almost fainted from shock, but that's another story.) Anyway, he doubled the recipe, so it was very hard to stir the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie batter. He lamented the nylon and silicone spoons we had saying he felt like all of them were going to break as he slowly, but surely, stirred. I told him I'd get him something else for next time. Ha!  I ordered this spoon hoping it would be hearty and strong. Holy moley...that it is. When I took it out of the package, my husband exclaimed the title of this review! He also said if this solid and well-made spoon won't stir the cookies next time, he'll need to stop doubling the recipe.  This is a substantial, stir-whatever-you-want-because-this-thing-is-a-beast wooden spoon. Now to make myself hand wash rather than place it in the dishwasher as it'll prolong its life....  Definitely recommend!  Thanks for reading this review! I really hope it helped you make a buying decision. Wishing you a healthy and blessed day!"
"I bought this specifically for deglazing my Instantpot. I have both the ceramic and stainless steel inserts. I had been using a wooden spoon as I did not want to scratch either insert. This meets the non-scratch requirement while getting the Fond up from the bottom of the pot. The handle of this utensil is quite thick. I like that. I feel it gives me more control as to the amount of pressure I use. Finally, as with all of my wooden utensils, I periodically treat with ‚ÄúFood Grade‚Äú mineral oil."
"After going gluten free, I learned that I needed to replace my wooden cooking utensils. Enter this odd looking spoon/spatula thing. Compared to my 10 year old bamboo knes, it's thick and has qeight to it. Not a flimsy piece of twig. The handle is round, not flat.  The reviews that said to oil it were spot on. I have food grade cutting board oil for my hardwood cutting boards, so i used that after the first wash and it soaked up quite a bit. Oiled it a 2nd time before it's first use. I've grown very fond of its oddness and like that it replaced 2 of my most used utensils. Would definitely buy again and will look into the other styles available should I decide I need more."
"As I've discovered cooking over the last 10 years I have also discovered the utensils that are indispensable, such as a sturdy wooden stirring spoon. Wood is stout but doesn't damage any cooking surfaces, impart any unwanted taste or leach unhealthful chemicals. I had been using a flat edged salad spoon for years until the tip got gnarly and ragged. I got stars in my eyes and bought a pricey Epicurean wood spoon with a flat, tapered handle, black piping and a round edge. I hated it from the moment I first used it. The handle was uncomfortable. Within 6 months, the black piping started chipping off. Last but not least, the rounded edge made it next to impossible to scrape browned bits, a feature I soon learned I loved about my old salad spoon. After doing some research I realized that what I wanted was a ""scraping spoon"". So for six bucks I took the plunge on this OXO. I am very happy. It‚Äôs comfortable in the hand, scrapes the bottom of a pan with ease, and the corner piece really does help scraping around the edges of pans. I also like that it has some depth to actually hold a fair amount of food/liquid for tasting and even serving. I‚Äôve used it countless times in the last month and a half which is a good sign. I highly recommend this spoon."
"Love this spoon! We moved to a new home within the last year. Sometimes stuff gets lost or left behind and my beloved wooden spoon was one of those things. I searched here on Amazon and found this Good Grips Wooden Spoon. It's a beefy handle that makes holding it while cooking easy. I love that flat back of the spoon, which keeps it from wobbling when laying it down on the stove or counter. Nice little touch. The wood is beautiful and appears sturdy. My husband is a woodworker and he even said it is a nice build. I'd buy it again."
Wish I'd bought one of these a long time ago. It's called a turner but I bought it specifically to stir food in the Instant Pot Pressure Cooker and it is perfect for that but it has become my favorite stirring tool for all kinds of skillet dishes as well. It has a good feel to it in the hand and is gentle on the surfaces of the skillets and Instant Pot.
"Many reviewers complained about the size of handle on this spoon, yes, it is huge! I have large-ish 75 year old semi-arthritic hands and this thing is absolutely great when it's time to help my spouse stir her awesome bread dough --or any other time. It is mass produced from wood, a natural material, don't expect miracles! Upon receipt, take some 150 or 180 sandpaper & go over entire surface lightly with attention to edges and naturally occuring rough spots. Rub down two or three times with plain mineral oil and repeat oiling on regular basis. Do the same with all of your wooden utensils. Never soak or put in dishwasher!"
"Efficient, durable, easy to use (if you've got strong hands), and very thorough. Gets all the juice and most of the pulp out - where you want it, and not still attached to the rind. Much prefer this to the dainty little squeezers and tiny collector bottles. Doesn't filter out the seeds, but a clean finger will do that job anyway. I go through a five pound bag of lemons every month, just mixing the juice with club sodas and making buttermilk for tastier pancakes and waffles. Easy to clean - just be sure to mark it with a ballpoint pen, ""Hand Wash Only."""
"I was making a large batch of beef stew the other day, and my beaten and cracked old wooden spoons just would not cut it...they were wither too short or too lightweight to get to the bottom of the pot to turn the browning meat. I went online and saw this was the most highly rated wooden spoon. After receiving it the next day, I know why...very sturdy, smooth edges, large enough to use as a serving spoon on a coated pan. It's perfect!"
"I bought this citrus reamer/juicer to replace an older, white, plastic reamer that I‚Äôve had for years. I looked at just replacing with the same kind. I looked at them in some stores and just didn‚Äôt see any that seemed sharp-edged enough. The OXO is sharper, longer, wider, works like a champ, doesn‚Äôt get slippery when juice runs down parts of it, and nice smooth-finished wood. The OXO citrus reamer/juicer is WAY more efficient than the one it‚Äôs replacing, which would tend to just slide around the inside flesh and not grab on to it to burst the pulp. I see LOTS of fresh citrus juicing in my future!"
"Purchased the large OXO Wooden Spoon and the OXO Wooden Corner Spoon. Both are very well finished, sturdy. These spoons will make baking and mixing various batters so much easier. Excellent size in the grip area and length is perfect too on both spoons. Smooth, sealed finish is easy to wash. Really surprised at the quality of both OXO Spoons. Highly recommend for anyone who loves to cook. Thank you for good packaging and speed of delivery too."
"Olive & beechwood are the best woods for kitchen utensils & this spoon is no exception. I own other OXO wooden spoons & have had NO problems with splitting or cracking. However, it took about a week of slathering them several times a day with mineral oil for them to eventually reach their saturation point but this has kept them 'healthy' for years & I have gotten good service from them. I love using this spoon or the saute paddle for mixing bread & very thick cookie dough. It's sturdy & just perfect for the task!"
"I‚Äôm in love for the first time! These are the only utensils I use now! I know this is going to sound crazy but I have always hated wooden spoons! I always felt that wooden spoons were not durable. They were so thin and weak with no grip. My family kept bugging me to get some again, so I decided to try this spoon from OXO. I honestly can‚Äôt believe how much I love these spoons!"
"HELLO! OXO Good Grips Wooden Turner. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS HUGE GRIP WOODEN TURNER WAS SO IMMENSE. I WAS IN SHOCK WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE. IT IS GUARANTEED TO DO WHAT IT'S CAPABLE IN DOING. LASTLY, IT IS VERY DURABLE & IT WILL LAST FOREVER & IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES OF: BEING EASY TO CLEAN, EASY TO HOLD & BEING VERY STURDY! I LOVE IT!"
"OXO Good Grips has done it again with a solid wooden turner that is easy to hold, easy to use, looks good and does what it is supposed to do. I recently invested in some expensive non-stick cookware and I am confident that I can use it and not damage the non-cook surfaces. I will be buying a few more of their wooden utensils. Just LOVE this company. Their products are ALWAYS attractive and most functional."
"This is a sturdy spoon. Oil it as it soaks up a lot initially. The first time I used it, I developed a split. Sent pics to oxo and they promptly responded and have another spoon coming to me. Great response time and they back their item. I have another spoon just like this one and had no issues with it so I must have recieved a lemon. Either way oxo made good on it and I‚Äôm a happy customer!"
I RECEIVED THIS YESTERDAY AND USED IT RIGHT AWAY TO REMOVE SOME BAR COOKIES OUT OF A BAKING PAN. WORKED GREAT!!! NO PROBLEM GETTING UNDER THE COOKIES TO REMOVE THEM AND LOVE THE WEIGHT OF THE SPOON. NOT TOO HEAVY AND NOT THIN AND FLIMSY!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND IT WASNT EXPENSIVE AT ALL! SOME OF THE SPOONS I LOOKED AT WERE SO EXPENSIVE!!! THIS IS A GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY! I PLAN ON BUYING MORE FOR GIFTS. LOVE OXO PODUCTS!
I loved this wooden spoon. However after only 2 months it started to split at the spoon end. I never let it soak in water for no more than maybe 15 seconds. I always immediately dried it off and applied butcher block oil after hand washing. I've seen other reviewer's state that there's cracked too. I do like the handle. I mainly used this to make sweet tea. But I ended up just discarding this after 3 months of use. Because the split went all the way up to the handle.
By a long shot the best juicer I've ever used. It's a serious instrument - heavy and the tip is sharp. I slice off a bit from one end of the citrus (I don't cut it in half) and this makes short work of the contents. Do this over a medium bowl in the sink to maximize juice capture and minimize mess. It makes short work of juicing and yields high results.
"I love, love, love this wooden ""spoon."" Not only does it act like a spoon, but I can actually scrape the bottom of a pot of beans. So handy! Whenever I see cooking shows with the chef scraping the bottom of the pan to get the ""fond"" up, I want to yell at them, ""Buy the OXO spoon scraper thing-ey."" Also, I put it in the dishwasher!!! Have been using mine for years now and throwing it into the dishwasher every time. No problems!"
"This simple device is quite useful and functional. Its feels sturdy and solid. In the left hand, I hold the sliced lime, in the right hand, I hold this reamer and apply even pressure while twisting the reamer. In doing so, I can squeeze out the lime juice as much as possible. When done, it cleans quick and easy with a simple rinse. A must have for all bars and margarita makers =)  I'm a huge fan of OXO products and own several different ones for various uses in my kitchen. It is my go to brand. This reamer is now a part of my arsenal."
"This is NOT a Flipper, it's a Pusher. The spatula is so thick that when you try to scoop under whatever you're cooking, it doesn't slide under it, it instead rams it from the side and pushes it over. I can't believe how horrible my pancakes turned out cooking with this. Same with the hash browns I tried to flip. Smashed to bits. Buy this if you want to have a miserable cooking experience!"
"My old reliable wooden spoon finally died on me after 25 years...this has been a great replacement. The finish on the spoon disappeared after it's first bath in the dishwasher, but I've had no problems with splintering or cracking despite it being in the raw, so to speak. I did simply rub some olive oil on it. It is of a substantial size, nice heft, with a good size bowl to taste test soups, sauces, and stews. The angled end also makes it a great tool for sauteing. This is a reliable brand and will become a staple in your kitchen as it is in mine."
"I used this for over a year without issue before it was time to replace. In contrast, the one I got from Calphalon to replace it with ("
It's my favorite tool when using my Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven. I don't have to worry about marring the enamel surface and can gently scrape up those tasty cooked-on bits to build flavor in my soups. LOVE IT!
"I've always used the cheaper wooden spoons and liked them, but this...OMG, I do think I'm in love! It's thick, sturdy, handle is long and easy to grip for thick batters or dough and it works great in a large pot of stew. I made the mistake of letting it sit too long with food on it once and it was a little hard to get clean. If you rinse it off right away, it comes clean easily. This was a little bit of a splurge for me, but I will buy another 1 or 2 in the future."
"Why why why have I not used one of these babies sooner?! My grandmother used one. My mother used one. I have lived a simpletons life until now. I cannot believe how much more juice you get from the lemon, lime, or orange using this vs the other options. Sure you have to manage the seeds‚Ä¶meh! I find I use half the amount of fruit to yeild the juice I need for recipes using this tool. Sorry granny you were right!"
"This OXO wooden spoon was my favorite for mixing cookie dough üç™ but then, after several months‚Äô use, a big chunk broke off the tip üòï. I was so bummed and actually surprised, since the quality of OXO products is usually excellent, in my experience. I was very careful to not leave it soaking in dishwater, as I know that weakens the wood. Guess my hunt for a wooden spoon as sturdy as the ones my mom and grandma used continues.."
"It's by OXO Good Grips. On America's Test Kitchen's equipment reviews, if their equipment is the winner it's the affordable runner up. It's comfortable in my hand. It does the job it's designed for. Price is right. Give it a whirl .... or ream ... you'll like it. yeah, I know, I sound like an ad writer."
"I once broke a metal broom handle, twice, in different locations, in the same day. Last week I snapped a ceramic paring knife blade in half, and other kitchen utensils have a tendency to not fare well under my less-than-tender ministrations. My wife jokingly refers to me as ""Hercules"" (I want to assure everyone it has nothing to do with his legendary temper, drinking, raping and violent streaks) and I have broken something like 10 spatulas, wooden utensils, kitchen gadgets and knives since the beginning of the year. I feel slightly like the chimp testing American Tourister luggage except nothing survives. This wooden spoon, though, is solid, rugged and shows no signs of cracking under the stress, yet. At first it might seem like I probably just don't get to play in the kitchen a lot, but the reality is a cook 2 or 3 times a day, every day for somewhere between 3 and 10 diners, so the spoon gets a lot of use and a lot of washing."
Feels great in your hand. Nice wood finish. I trust OXO products they are always reliable and well made. I have several OXO kitchen utensils and have been using them for a long time and they are just like new. Always hand wash wooden utensils to keep them like new. I am very happy with my purchase. I also orders the OXO wooden spatula and OXO nylon spoon for my new non-stick cookware.
As the headline says I bought this spatula for making fudge. The handle is sturdy and fits my hand well. I like the fact that I'm able to reach the rounded parts of my fudge making pot as well as scrape the bottom to keep things from burning. I had used various sized spoons made from silicon or wood but nothing works as well as this spatula.
"I've always used the glass ones you squeeze the lemon or lime around, but I saw this one being used on the Great British Bake Off, so I tried it. Wow, what a difference it makes. You can twist at various angles and really get into all the flesh and you squeeze out a whole lot more juice than on the other more traditional kind. Easy to hold, easy to manipulate with the fruit, and easy to press against all of the flesh, and you get so much more juice. Definitely worth it."
"Great wooden spatula. Good value for the cost. It‚Äôs made of wood, so be careful around fire. I only use it in my cast iron skillet. Use it to saut√© peppers, onions, and most anything else I put in the skillet. Works well as a scrapper if any food gets stuck on when I‚Äôm done cooking. No complaints. Might even buy another."
"For some reason I've become addicted to adding lemon juice and the zest to most everything I'm eating these days, from soups, salads to some desserts. I was looking for a nice wooden reamer and decided on the OXO brand and have not been sorry. OXO is the hands down winner of many of the product tests on America's Test Kitchen and for good reason. They manufacture a good product at a reasonable price.  Wooden reamers can have a heft price tag if you're looking in some of the specialty shops. At William Sonoma a comparable reamer costs a third more. This unit is made of solid Beech wood, the grip is comfortable and the cutting ribs are sharp and effective.  Get every drop of juice but be sure to strain through your fingers to catch the pips. I'm very happy with this product."
I honestly only use my wood spoon for candy making. My last spoon lasted most of my adult life. It was just starting to show age so I finally got a new one. I was very happy with how nice and sturdy it is. I have used it and it's strong and cleans well. I hand wash everything. Excellent value for price.
Solid wood easy to cleans really gets a lot of juice out of each üçã lemon or lime each time I've used it. It's super affordable fast shipping great quality. Should last and it's portable small enough to take with you anywhere!
"I bought this a while ago but only recently started to use it. In the past, I've mostly used those little gizmos, some metal some plastic, that are like a tube with sharp edges that you twist into the lemon or lime and then squeeze the fruit and the juice comes out through the tube, which sometimes has a spout. What in the world are they called? Sometimes they have a cap on the end so you can put it back in the fridge if you don't need all the juice at once. I always found that the metal ones worked better than the plastic ones but that while I was twisting the thing into the lemon or lime with great force, it was cutting its way into the lemon or lime at one end and cutting its way into my hand at the other end. I'd never used a reamer before. I love it. It's easy to use. It's simple. It's fast. Just hang a strainer over the bowl. Clean-up is easy. My hands aren't bleeding. Life is good."
"Great quality and matches the most expensive wooden spoons I've seen selling on the net. I use this one allot, espeically when I'm carmalizing tomatoe paste for my spaghettie sauce. Thanks for making it available on Amazon! What a great price for such quality!  Update 4-25-2011: Well this spoon has traveled its way through lots of spaghetti sauce pans, casseroles and so much more, while enduring countless washings in soap and water. I even use it in my distiller machine, which I bought on Amazon.com, when I make my home made distilled water. It's great after you pour in the the minerals used to ""de-glaze"" the stainless steal container. The deglazing minerals do no harm to the wooden spanner, nor are they toxic. But this spanner can easily reach the flat part of the stainless steal bottom and unstick all the accumulated minerals left behind by the city water from doing a week's worth of distilling of my city water for drinking here in Los Angeles.  All I can say is that after four years, I don't think this spoon is ever going to wear out! I keep it in a stainless steal canister on my kitchen counter top along with the wooden hammer and other wooden utensils I bought like this one and for over four years, I sure have gotten value for my money. This spoon should be wearing a cape and cowl given how well it has stood up to such a grueling four year trial in my kitchen!"
"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this. It had a nice weight to it and looked nice too! It was a great length, making it easy to hold onto and to use. Cleaned up nicely with a sponge, soap, & water. I like that it has a hole to hang it up if I wanted to. Nice addition to my kitchen and the price wasn‚Äôt bad either!"
"I actually use this to make fresh orange juice on the weekends. I just cut a small section off the top of the orange and ream it out with this reamer while squeezing a bit with my hand. I do this over a fine strainer on top of a bowl and then transfer to a glass. Takes about 4 large oranges to get a full glass. I have tried MANY different citrus juicers, both manual and electric. This is by far the best and quickest way. Granted you will get more yield with an electric juicer, but I don't always want to deal wirth the set up, break down, and clean up. This tool is quick and easy. Nice, solid wood design. I love it and will probably buy another as back up. I just wonder if I should coat it with mineral oil once in awhile. I haven't yet and it seems to be holding up OK."
The simple tool does the best juicing of a single lemon I've experienced. The best part besides the juice is the fiber you also get when juicing with this tool. Great for my purpose. lemon/honey water each morning does the trick.
"Nice, sturdy wooden spoon. Unlike most that are on the market, this OXO model has a nice thick, sturdy handle that you can grip easily. Most other wooden spoons have that thin ""almost feel like they are going to break in your hand"" feel to them. And the spoon part has that same thick and sturdy feature to them as well. For the price, get this one. Forget the ""popular chefs"" name on product brand, this one is WAY better!"
"There is no comparison between this wooden spatula and the many inferior ones I‚Äôve owned and used in my 71 years. I don‚Äôt expect to have to replace these, and I‚Äôll bequeath them to my favorite son!"
I squeeze fresh lemon juice over my salad almost every day and I love this product! I had one for years and lost it during a move and just had to get another one. I've found this one to be the best and not all lemon reamers are the same. You can get soooo much more lemon juice out of a lemon compared to squeezing the lemon by hand. You can use it for any citrus fruit and it's inexpensive too.
"Bought this for my enameled cast iron dutch oven, since you can't use metal for those. I've used the regular Oxo spoons for years, but I needed a slotted one this time because I only had a metal one. It's a big spoon, it works..not a lot else to say.  I can't speak to the longevity of this particular spoon, but I have some regular Oxo spoons that are probably 7+ years old, which have been in the dishwasher probably twice a week since I got them, and they are holding up fine. They have turned a little darker and the color has dulled a bit, similar to what happens to anything wooden that gets left outside for a long time, but they still perform the same as the day I bought them. So, if those spoons are any indication, I would suspect that this one will last nearly a lifetime because slotted spoons don't get used nearly as much."
"The thing I appreciate most about this rumor is the ""sharpness"" of the edges. It wouldn't hurt you/cut you in anyway, but it is very good at reaming out the juice from a lemon, etc."
I love this juicer. Easy for citrus fruits and is not made of plastic! Nice and small. I use it over a small strainer to catch seeds and pulp and it works great. Juices lemons to the pith no problem. You don‚Äôt need a fancy plastic or motorized gadget. Just get this. Better for the environment too.
"Not the prettiest wood ever, but works well, cleans well, and is way sturdier than the pretty olive wood one I have which is cracking. Handle's nice and thick and cylindrical which is easier than a flat handle to hold. They aren't heavy either which is nice."
Actually very surprised by this little tool that really gets the juice out of lemons and limes. Easy and quick to use and easy on my hands and easy to clean...plus it only takes up a tiny space. Just ordered one for a friend and I have three other types of lemon press tools that are going to be gifted or donated out.
"If you're looking for a wooden spoon to help you de-glaze, this one is great. The corner on one-side sticks out to help with that. The downside is it's made for right-handers to go counter-clockwise, not left-handers (like me).  But I won't hold it against them because Earth is a right-handed world..."
"It works well. I use it to ream out lemons. The way it works, it pushes inward so it prevents the seeds from making it out into my cup/container. I have also gotten good enough to not even get any juice on my hands.  I just rinse the reamer off with cold water and pat dry real quick with a kitchen towel and leave it on my cutting block to fully dry. The reamer is a single solid piece of wood. I didn't want any of the other models that are glued together with several pieces. I'm guessing that over time, the acidity from the citrus would erode the glue and cause them to fall apart. I won't have to worry about that with this particular reamer.  So far so good and this is working better than I expected."
"This is a must have tool - extremely practical for when you don't have a citrus juicer machine, and for when you need a bit of juice but don't want to clean an entire juicer machine. Very easy to use, gets all the juice and pulp (if you want) out, and is great for cocktails or used when cooking. Highly recommend having one of these in your kitchen drawers. I even bring it out when we eat meals with lemons/limes (i.e. fish) as one can get much more of the juice out, and with less effort"
"Love the wood and Sturdy Quality. Now my Go to Kitchen tool, and doubles as a nice scraping tool to get the bottom of my stainless-steel pots clean without scratching it."
"I love using OXO's lineup of wooden spoons. They are solid and comfortable to hold, and won't scratch metal or nonstick cookware interiors. They are so very superior to those generic, cheap wooden spoons with thin handles that are uncomfortable to hold. This spoon is perfect for stirring sauces or sauteeing. With the exception of my knives, among my cooking tools, I use this spoon the most, along with the larger version.  Regarding the criticism of the spoon being made from two pieces of wood glued together - I think OXO has changed its manufacturing process for the better, because the spoon that I own is definitely made from one piece of wood. I would recommend this product to all home cooks and also suggest buying the large and small slotted spoons as well.  Tip: to protect your spoon from cracking, apply some food-grade mineral oil and rub it in all over. Apply once a month or so to keep the wood protected and to prevent it from drying out, and your spoon will last a long time."
"I felt like I was Anne of Green Gables making lemonade for the big Sunday picnic. Lost a star for cleaning, because it's not dishwasher safe, but easy enough to clean with a sponge and some warm water and mild soap. Lost a star for durability because the wood may crack over time, but you could easily use this in case of vampire attack. Has a nice sturdiness, very effective and yields all the juice along with a good amount of pulp; I personally prefer a pulpy juice. Lost a star for easy to hold because I'm sure a cushioned, ergonomic handle would feel better for making mimosas, but bonus points for the nostalgia of going well with my farmgirl dress from Target."
"I suppose I have reached the point of my life in which kitchen utensils excite me so here is my review: This wooden spoon is a game changer. The handle is thick and provides a steady hold, the spoon is a good size and the weight is good too. I am honestly thrilled over this purchase"
I have small hands and this spoon is easy to hold even while stirring heavy cookie dough. The spoon is shallow - it's not meant for serving or for scooping. The wood is sanded smooth and there are no edges that dig into your palms. It [hand] washes easily and dries quickly.
"Although the wood surface isn't as smooth as my bamboo spoons, this is a big, comfy stirrer that does the job well. The scraper edge is very handy, too. Oxo, another A+ utensil."
"This spoon is very useful for stirring and serving large batches of one-pot meals. Wooden spoons are superior for mixing thick foods compared to nylon, but have always fallen short on the ability to serve right out of the pot. This particular one fits the bill and has not cracked on me yet after running through the dishwasher a few times."
"This is a raw edged wooden reamer that is sharp and precise enough to get in there and juice lemons, oranges and limes with your hand without acidic citruses reacting with steel or worse still - plastic with its thousands of chemicals."
"We purchased this spoon for my mother-in-law, who‚Äôs fingers are seriously misshapen with arthritis. It‚Äôs now quite difficult for her to use a standard wooden spoon, and the OXO Good Grips was an obvious answer. The large handle makes it much easier to use, and thus increases her ability to cook for herself, and therefore her independence.  Recommended."
This is a great spoon for cooking. What surprised me was how big it is. Very thick and solid and quite large. This is a good thing but its much larger than any I've ever seen. I will actually be looking for a smaller wooden spoon since it's actually too big for my smallest pot!
"I hate cluttering the kitchen with little gadgets, especially those that only perform 1 single function. What did we need a reamer for, I thought, when we could just squeeze lemons with our own hands? That only takes half a minute.  But I bought this reamer based on the reviews and I have to say, it's earned its place in our cluttered kitchen. It's true that it's not really that difficult to just cut a lemon in half and squeeze out the juice with your bare hand. But boy, this reamer makes it even easier! Just seconds is all you need. Plus, easy to clean (because let's face it, when you're as lazy as I am, sometimes you don't want to use a gadget that takes more time cleaning than it saves you using--I'm thinking of you, garlic crusher!). I just rinse it under the faucet. Plus, it's kinda fun. A good way to release a little aggression while making some delicious lemonade.  One thing I noticed though is that the wood is not completely smooth. If you run your finger against the reamer part, in the direction of base to tip, you can feel bits of the wood splinters. That concerned me a bit at first but it has not caused any problem that I could notice. I think it could potentially be an issue if you scrubbed too hard on this."
"This review is for the corner spoon (there seems to be a mix of products within these reviews). I love cooking with heavy wooden spoons, they're good at so many different things, are non-reactive, and don't damage cookware. My older spoons had started to develop cracks, so I ordered a couple of these, and they work very well. Heavy and solid, with a nice, long handle."

"I needed a non-metallic spatula to saut√© mushrooms in a Teflon skillet. This was the cheapest high-temp set. The top utensil, which I call a 'spoon-atula', was perfect. It did not melt, and allowed me to flip or taste the mushroom pieces nicely. From the top of the photo, there is also a jar spatula (think mayonnaise), a mini-spatula, and a traditional spatula for scraping mixing bowls or whatever. I like the color, they are very flexible, durable, and won't melt."
"They have a sturdy interior - might be metal - so they don't overbend. They have just enough spring to clean a bowl well. They are heat resistant so I use one for sauteing in a fry pan. Nice color, not too big sizewise and I use them a lot. They go in the dishwasher with no problems"
""
"I love to cook and I love having nice things to cook with. After a short period of time, most of my spatula heads don‚Äôt stay on. So annoying. So my husband purchased these (because if the head falls off, it‚Äôs broken) and I love them so much! Great variety of sizes and shapes. It would be a great starter pack for someone just moving out into their own place."
"I recently bought this set of spatula and have absolutely fallen in love with them. They are durable, heat resistant up to 600 Fahrenheit, non-slippery, dishwasher safe, and the best part they do not retain odors or colors. They have good quality and come in the perfect size too.  I love getting in the kitchen with my kids and my toddler was my fascinated with this set as they are not as big and heavy as other spatulas from different brands we have around. Love the variety of colors offered! 10/10 recommended."
I own several ‚Äúname brand‚Äù spatulas but they are two separate pieces and food residue gets into the area where they are joined and it never looks completely clean. I haven‚Äôt owned these long enough to rate the durability but they seem to be very sturdy. I also like the different end shapes. Very satisfied with this purchase.
I've spent too many years melting cheaper spatulas. I suspect that these will last longer than I will ! One piece without joins or cracks to wonder what may be growing in there. These will last so long I consider them; GREEN (even though they are a pretty blue ; )
"The large one has a slight spoon shape, which is good for stirring pots. The long narrow one is good for jelly jars. and the others are good for mayonnaise jars. Super easy to clean."
They are phenomenal!! My mother got some and after using hers I hopped right on here and got some for myself! They are so easy to clean! And work great with all our pots and pans. No longer worried about scratching them. They are great! Will probably buy more as gifts throughout the years.
I like the size and how easy they are to work with because I have arthritic restrictions affecting my grip. Love the no slip handles and the heat resistance features. They mix cooking bowls/pots ingredients while you‚Äôre stirring things very well. Hated to give up my other spatulas but these have been a great replacement.
"I really was drawn to these spatulas because they are so heat resistant. I also really like the fact that the spatulas are easy to clean, and have a stainless steel ""spine"" inside the handle and part way into the spatula itself. I have always used wooden handle Rubbermaid spatulas, but they are not heat resistant and these are far superior to my old standbys!"
"Heat resistance, durability and just the right amount of flexibility allows for a wide variety of uses: scraping out cold and hot containers, frosting pastries and cakes, and stirring/folding in ingredients. Single piece structure eliminates crud build up at connecting points and the chance of separation. Easy to clean and sanitize; I put them in the dishwasher. The different shapes in this set cover all of my spatula needs‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt need 10 spatulas, but I do need a few different shapes. My only complaint is color. I wish they came in more subtle colors."
I like the fact that these spatulas are all one piece so there is no way for mold to form in the seams. I feel they are much more sanitary than the two piece. There are a variety of sizes to meet all my cooking needs.
Ordered to use just for baking and they work great. I worried the silicone would hold smells from the food they touched but these do not. They are a little shorter in length then I was expected but I should have looked at the measurements.
"This is my 2nd set, I use them for everything from baking to cooking. They are dishwasher safe but clean up easily. They're very sturdy but I like the flexibility over a wooden spoon. I would recommend them."
"My niece is an executive chef and she recommended these silicone spatulas. I ordered them and they are great! They are an excellent value, too! One of the things she liked about them was they are all one piece, so can be put in the dishwasher."
I used these to make chocolate pies which requires a very high temp. They were perfect. I love the color & it hasn‚Äôt faded. Easy to clean.
"I really like these. There are no nooks or crannies for ""icky"" stuff to accumulate. Easy to clean. They're a good size and very usable. I have purchased two colors. I would recommend!"
"Works great, easy to clean"
"I love this set! I am almost certain I haven‚Äôt gone a day without using them. I have had other silicone spatulas that inevitably have their heads come off. These are great. They go in the dishwasher, there‚Äôs no discoloration from tomato based sauces, and they each serve the purpose they are meant to. I love these."
I have other spatula sets that don't compare to these. These are outstanding. I don't worry about putting them in hot soups or items on the stove or in the oven to stir. Beautifully made.
I have used these to fry bacon and sausage. Also use them for eggs. They really don‚Äôt melt. So easy to use and clean. I‚Äôve got an extra set for myself and one for my sister.
"Love the texture, the sizes and the color. Highly recommend."
"I love spatulas, those are sturdy and well made, and on paper, they seem to be safe to use since they are LFGB approved. I have yet to use them. No updates from me means no problem with those."
"While I haven't had them long, I used one to stir fry rice and vegetables and they handled the heat with no problems. Lightweight yet strong rubber."
"We have been looking for some good spatulas for some time, I believe these are it. So far all they claim to be."
"Love these so much. Used last night, honestly could probably buy one set in each color. Love them that much. Thank you for a great product v"
These are quality spatulas! The different sizes are extremely handy and useful. They make life in the kitchen much easier.
Was looking for some solid spatulas that were easy to clean instead of the old two piece. These are great!! The old ones in the trash
I can tell these will be around much longer than my old fashion plastic on wood stick versions. Very pleased.
I love these spatulas so much I own two sets in different colors. I use one set for savory dishes and the other for sweet. They are very sturdy and heat resistant. I make candy that cooks to 300¬∞ and these are perfect for stirring. Easy to clean too
"Haven‚Äôt used yet but seem sturdy and look nice. Dishwasher safe, handle high temps according to product info."
"I just purchased my 4th order of these spatulas because they are so sturdy, scrape the side of the bowl really well without folding under and they are very easy to clean. As these spatulas are one solid piece, there are no nooks or crannies for bits of food to hide. One spatula that is long, rectangular and narrow will be very useful for spreading icing. The price makes these very affordable. They are a very good value and I bought sets for my family members who love to cook. I just purchased them so I will see how well they hold up. For now, I am very pleased with this purchase."
"These spatulas are just what I've been looking for - strong, easy to clean, attractive. These are all one piece so no problem with molding headpieces. Yay!"
Many uses for these great spatulas. I especially like the one solid piece design and they clean up well in the dishwasher!
Excellent quality. Solid. Good shapes for different kinds of scraping. Better than anything else at cleaning out a blender.
"The spatulas feel very study, easy to maintain a good grip plus so easy to clean and keep bacteria-free since they are one-piece procucts."
So easy to use for baking and stirring Cleans easy and is dishwasher safe
This is a very high quality spatula set. Came nicely boxed. Would make a great gift.
"I like everything about these spatulas. They fit the bill. My daughter is a chef, and she applauded."
They are exactly what I was looking for versatile and one for every need.
This set is the best. I have replaced all of my old spatulas and these are fantastic.
I've learned that having one piece instead of having the spoon attached to a handle is best.
Best thing is flexibility and dishwasher safe. Also love color.
"Does exactly what I need, stir ,scoop heat resistant and cleans up easily."
I really liked the quality and fast shipment!
solid and comfortable and works as it should
Product is well made and extremely functional. I would recommend them.
These come in handy and are professional tools.
These are great silicone utensils. The color goes really well with my kitchen.
Wish I had them years ago..
So far it's great. Works perfectly and cleans up easily.
It‚Äôs a good product highly recommend it.
"as advertised, good stuff"
I Absolutely recommend this product
I'd buy these again and recommend them to everyone. Very sturdy.
The long spatulas are great for getting inside peanut butter jars and spreading mayonnaise
These are great
They work beautifully and are durable. I love the assortment in size & design.
Items are as described and arrived on time
Really good product
A very good product
Baker goods are fattening lol
Fast shipping excellent product
"Multiple uses of different sizes! Sturdy,clean easy! Heat resistant is a major plus!"
Great so far
All the sizes you may need
"Love these spatulas, especially the slim one. The slim spatula fits into thin jars that the larger ones can't. Nothing sticks to them. The color doesn't fade. I have the blue; very nice."
Definitely recommend. Easy to hand wash but also dishwasher safe too.
"About 10 years ago I bought this whimsical spatula at a hardware store because it was so cute. In the past decade I have used it daily for eggs only and I love it because it's just delicate and small enough to lightly scramble or flip a fried egg. It's made just for eggs. Bigger spatulas are overkill. The Li'l Joie is indeed a joy! So I was delighted to see they are still available because mine was getting so old and worn-out and finally split a little from daily use, but it did last a pretty long time! I'm happy to spend the $7 for another decade of service from the Mini Joie. I recommend using those purple Scotch Brite Scrubbers to clean it because of their ""even eggs and cheese won't stick"" claim (it's true!). This spatula is perfect for the egg enthusiast as it made flipping and scrambling my breakfast eggs a... l'il joy!"
"It is very small, see picture. But it works perfectly for what I purchased it for, flipping eggs in my smallest frying pan. When I first got it, based on it's size from the other spatula, (which the tip is too fat to get under an egg without breaking the yoke,) I thought this is a joke. It looks more like a toy for a girls easy bake oven than what I was expecting. But after using it I was quite surprised at how well it works. It is very thin at the tip that goes under the egg, and so far, quite a few eggs and I haven't broke a yoke yet. It works like a charm. It is now my go to spatula for flipping eggs."
"Almost every morning, cook a one egg omelette. First - fry some onions, bacon pieces (buy a pound, cook it, break it up, store it in a plastic baggy), sometimes green peppers, sometimes mushrooms. Beat the egg....add a little milk....beat some more....poor mix carefully over the fried stuff to get an even thickness layer....when the egg layer gets a little firm, I insert the flipper under the egg, tilt/rotate the pan, and let the uncooked egg mix spill on to the bottom. After the egg mix firms up....carefully insert the flipper underneath....the flipper is a little flimsy and perhaps slightly undersized...lift the pan and give a little wrist action to give the firm egg mix a little momentum, and flip using the flipper. Sprinkle some cheese over the egg mix and fold the egg mix in half using the flipper. Flip the folded egg mix again with the flipper....after waiting for cheese to melt...but don't want the omelette over cooked. Slide omelette on to plate. Clean the frying pan and the flipper. Food tends to stick to the flipper....but comes off with a little hand scrubbing per the product directions. Eat the egg, while usually reading the bible, usually with a little yogurt, sometimes a banana or a single slice of toast with strawberry jelly. What else is there to say? Its a good $5 flipper. Probably buy one once a year because the flipper seems a little beat up after a month of use."
"To start, this little spatula is just that...little. It's a lot smaller than I expected it to be. That said, it's an awesome little spatula that works great for what is was designed for and that's flipping eggs! We love having eggs for breakfast on the weekends and especially enjoy fried eggs cooked on a griddle. The front portion of this little spatula is tapered to a very thin width which allows you to get under the egg easily and without breaking the yolks. Because of it's small size, it's easy to use and easy to store. Cleans off easily as well. If you're interested in this spatula but have reservations about ordering, I'd say you've nothing to worry about - it does a great job and I would recommend it."
My niece bought my first one for Christmas. She and her family alway stayed with us on New Years. I always cooked breakfast. She said this was her favorite cooking utensil and I agree.
After about 50 + uses. Still good shape. I make an egg sandwich every morning and nothing beats this spatula for flipping the egg out of the little pan. I throw it in the dishwasher too. This is my second one after my dog chewed the first.
This little kitchen tool is the best at flipping eggs out there.
"I love, love, love this little spatula! It‚Äôs perfect for my one egg little skillet!! I use it almost every day and it‚Äôs so easy to use and clean!! I have one in my permanent residence and one in my Florida winter home!"
"I have an egg pan so I can make 3 perfect cute little eggs individually. However, a normal spatula totally does not fit in that small circular space making it very hard to flip the egg without turning what is sunny side up to scrambled.  Thankfully, this little spatula is perfect! Halfway through it, it's more flexible on the spatula part making it really easy to spread the oil in the pan first and get under to flip the egg.  It's exactly what I needed."
"If you use this to flip eggs without breaking the yoke, you won't be disappointed!! As far as using this for anything else, I wouldn't recommend it, use it for the dippy eggs only, it will last forever."
Already had one... got tired of packing it in and out of the camper... time to get another one! It's the perfect spatula for using in mini fry pans... more flexible than any others I've tried.
"The small egg spatula arrived on time and in good condition. It fits the little frying pan we have. I am still trying to master turning the egg with it, but any failures are on my part, not the spatulas! I may have needed something just a bit larger to turn the egg easier. We've only used it a few times. If we have any issues with it later on I will try to update this review."
I had one of these years ago and let me tell you THE best spatula ever! Flips eggs so easily and fits into small pans. Also great for cookies. I had to throw mine out years ago and I finally bought a new one.
"I Love an egg ""over easy"" in the morning. Flipping them has always been a hit or miss operation until I purchased this spatula. My wife rolled her eyes when it arrived in the post now she uses it too. Haven't broken a yolk in over a month. Will get another one for the RV."
This is the only spatula my husband uses to flip eggs. He had 1 for years but it broke and I was so happy to see the exact same one on Amazon. Love It!
"Definitely a niche item, that seems a bit flimsy, BUT... Turns out that's perfect for the related little egg fry pan and digs easily under an egg from the side in a tight space so very effective. I make eggs often enough that I've bought a second one so that when the kids toss one in the dishwasher I still have my beloved little egg spatula..."
"I bought this to go with my one egg pan, and it works beautifully. The end of the spatula is extremely thin and flexible, which is a plus for working in such a tiny pan. At first I worried about it being fragile, but it seems to be both flexible and strong. I would not try to use this spatula in other conxtexts - flipping thick hamburgers or sandwiches - but it works beautifully for what I bought it for - flipping an egg in a tiny pan."
"This is just plain cute. It's my favorite! I would definitely buy it again, no doubt about it. Yes it's tiny. I use it for flipping one egg at a time. If I have two eggs to flip, I use it to cut them in the middle, and flip each egg separately.  And did I mention how cute it is?? Definitely whimsical and makes me smile. Buy it, you'll like it. :-)"
"I used to have to buy it from my local Bed Bath and Beyond, but could not find it the last few times I went there. This one is great for small size jobs like frying a single egg etc., The cost online was much more cheaper than my local stores."
"My fiance just loves her little single egg pan. I mean loves it... It's odd really. I mean, why eat one egg?  Anyway, if you have one of those pans, you know what a pain a ""full-sized"" spatula can be. So, here's the alternative. It works perfectly and the egg on top just thrills my fiance to no end."
"We go through alot of eggs, and I am picky about how they are cooked...I like the yolk runny but not broken and I found I was breaking most of my yolks during the flipping process. I saw this little spatula and its made a world of difference. I have small hands as well, so its perfect."
"This is so convenient. I have a tiny single egg skillet and all my spatulas are too big to fit, plus they were too thick to really get under the egg. Flipping eggs was always a pain but with this it's super small and super thin. A great tool! I bought one for my sister as a Christmas present."
"This little spatula is the perfect size for our single-egg pan. It's flexible, yet not flimsy. Only negative is that it is NOT dishwasher safe. But as long as you don't let the egg dry on, it's really no problem to hand-wash. Made a great stocking-stuffer. Would be a good Easter basket item, too!"
Sturdy yet flexible to flip that egg!
Needed a tiny spatula for my double egg pan. Works like a charm! and it's cute!
This is a good little egg flipper!
right size for pan
O.K. product it got limp over time. I wish it were more ridged.
Love this . It goes with my collection.
I absolutely love this little spatula. Purchased it at least 15 years ago and just ordered another because the original has been overused for too long.
with the tiny little fry pan i bought for making one egg in the morning...and it's cute too. i don't normally go for cute but what the heck...it is and i'm happy with it. cleans nicely too and feels more like silicone blend than a true nylon.
"I was so upset when the little egg spatula that I had (quite a few years of use!) broke! But so excited when I found I could order some new ones ( I got 2). Delivery was prompt, packaging just fine. Very Happy!"
"Just what I needed for my small egg pan, perfect size, easy to turn eggs, small pancakes etc."
"When you are watching your cholesterol (as I am, truly Doctor X, I am) and can only occasionally have a real egg this is the flipper to use to flip it. Small but it gets the job done and washes up faster than those huge turners."
This is a small and convenient spatula I use for scrambled eggs. I have used it for up to 6 eggs with no problem.
Love making single egg in tiny skillet- this is a must
"It looks like a toy. It's so little, has the goofy egg on it. But dang if it doesn't work extremely well. Clearly someone out there spent a lot of time stressing over the most intricate of details in pursuit of the perfect egg flipper. Well - kudos. Mission Accomplished."
This is my second little Egg Spatula replacing a worn-out one. Fits nicely into my little egg poach skillet and keeps me from scratching the surface of the pan.
Work awesome in our restaurant
Love this
"This is a great companion for the one-egg fry pay. It works great, because these small fry pans do not accommodate a regular-sized spatula. Also, really cute-looking!"
"Works perfectly, and it's the first spatula I grab for when cooking in my Joie egg pan!"
"....for our needs. It flips the egg nicely. It's small, compact and easy to store. :) I can't stand big utensils.  Love Jo!e products!"
"This is a really good product, even the spatula it self it feels kind of floppy, really works when flipping the eggs, highly recommended."
Great little spatula that I use in my one egg pan. Seller proactively contacted me to introduce themselves and check on my purchase experience. Can't ask for anything more.
I love these little spatulas! they work perfect for cooking eggs in a small pan! It was shipped quickly and band new!
Best Egg Spatula EVER!
"Bought this to use with the ""Nordic Ware Scandinavian Silver Dollar Pancake Pan"". It is just a perfect fit and cute too."
Easy to flip eggs
Good thing they made a flipper lol it was hard to make an over medium egge but this is fabulous thanks FIVE STAR RATING
Great for using with little egg frying pans !! My daughter loves hers !! Me too !
Great little product. Works perfectly for flipping eggs cooked in the small Joie pan.
"Minimsize for the miniskillet, love this lil cutie."
"my wife had been looking for something like this forever, now she can finally flip eggs without breaking the yolk."
"Have to have with the small single egg pan, love pan and spatula, they are perfect for someone living alone."
"Wonderful product to use, would recommend to others."
This is a great gift for kids and just the right size for their little hands so they can learn to cook and help in the kitchen.
AWESOME
Just what I needed for my mini fry pan to make my own sausage & egg McMuffin. Arrived promptly as well.
"Small and cute, and fits a very small, one egg, frying pan."
Great little flipper perfect for my mini egg frying pan
perfect size for small omelets. bends nicely when trying to flip and cook the egg.
Perfect fit and bend-ability for the one egg fry pan.
I have the egg small pan for the perfect egg sandwich. This spatula fits perfect in this small pan to flip the egg. Would recommend this spatula
"Not only fun, but cute and practical. Delivery was spot on."
Small and flexible to use in omelet pan.
Works pretty good
Arrived quickly - Seller had a very good price in comparison with others. The item is straight foward - used with a small cast iron fry pan to fix an omelette on a daily basis. Replaced another exact item that finally cracked across the 3 holes after several years of use.
Just the right size for my egg pan
Just what I ordered...thank you so much!
"These are thicker where the handle inserts, seem to be better quality than most of the cheap silicone spatula/turners I've seen or purchased. I have another, where you can see that the handle is very near the surface of the spatula. I expect that won't last too long. These look like they will hold up."
Very happy with the quality and design. They worked even better than I had hoped for.
"These spatulas are good quality and work perfectly, making your cooking a lot easier."
So far these spatulas are holding up very well. I have used the larger one every day since I received them about a week ago.. Every other one I have purchased have always started fraying at the tips after about 3 uses even though they said they were rated to 600 degrees. I tried the cheap and more expensive models ($14.00) for one and they all failed. Only time will tell on this set.. So far these have been holding up very well.
These are the highest quality spatulas I have been able to find. They look great and are easy and comfortable to hold. They work well with non-stick pans. Turning pancakes and eggs and making stir fry is easy with these. I like the fact they came in the 2 sizes - regular and small.
"I finally got rid of my 25 year old pans (laughing) and bought my husband (no laughing) new Scan Pans which could last another 25 years. They are expensive. To make sure I don‚Äôt scratch them, I bought new spatulas. These are very strong."
"These have a wonderful design and solid construction, and just the right amount of flex in the handles. My initial thoughts was it was too short, but turns out that all my other spatulas were just a little too long!"
"These cooking utensils are not flimsy and cheaply made. There are some I've had that I use a couple of times, then have to dispose of. I expect these to be in my kitchen a good long time!"
"These 2 spatulas are just what I wanted. They seem sturdy, heat-resistant and have the perfect edge for scooping up pancakes or whatever I want to slide from the pan onto the plate. I like that the handle flexes without being wobbly. Perfect for me!"
Just what I was looking for. Strong enough to turn anything and still safe on my cookware.
These things are great. Rigid to get up under what you are cooking and supple enough to not scratch the pan. Great!
I bought these because they can resist up to 600 degrees of heat! Good product!!
Bought for cooking my morning eggs. Works fine cleans easily
Only had them for about a month but we like them so far.
"I‚Äôve only used a handful of times, but it holds up quite well during cooking and in the dishwasher!"
Very great resistant and easy to clean.
Exactly as described and was what I wanted!
Great for turning eggs or flipping pancakes.
exceeded my expectations
Really good quality products.
These tools work great on my no scratch pans.
Great spatulas at a great price.
easy to use
Work as expected. No problems.
Got these because the spatulas that I had previously just weren't up to the job. Everything stuck to them.
Love them.
Ordered 5 different spatulas from different manufactures. Wife says that the larger of the two in the package is her new absolute favorite. Looking at purchasing a second for a backup.
This product worked as expected and would buy again if needed.
"So far so good after a few weeks. Sturdy, no metal break through."
These are the best very sturdy.
"Very sturdy, easy to clean! Great buy"
Best utensils in my kitchen
"Not exactly what I wanted, but I like it easy to use and a good size. I like the smaller size."
Great product
Great thanks again
Great product
N/a
Anything
Very sturdy & strong
Good quality
The smaller spatula keeps dishwasher marks while the larger one comes out like new. They are heavier than some flimsy ones. Good firm grip. I definitely would purchase these again.
I bought this for my husband and he likes him a lot they‚Äôre easy for him to use and he‚Äôs not afraid of burning them.
I love this makes cooking delightful
I haven‚Äôt used It enough to give an accurate opinion but It Is the right size and they are sturdy
Small spots where silicone has worn away within 2 weeks of use! And I've only used it for flipping eggs.
"These spatulas are kind of thick so its hard to get precise motions, and oil likes to stick to them. They‚Äôre also kind of short but overall they‚Äôre ok."
"Good product, but I was expecting a longer lifespan."
What do you need a book?
Both the photo and the description show 2 different sized spatulas. What I received were 2 spatulas of exactly the same size. Totally identical. Why would I want that? Merchant substituted product for what was actually described and shown. Now I have to go to the department store during this pandemic to return it. THANKS Bankky!
"After they are washed, they are discolored. They look terrible. They have a white color to them."
These work great. I can use in a pan on the stove top when making pancakes or turning food that just came out of the oven!
"These are essential in the kitchens of today IF you use non stick pans. Your pans will last ten times longer, if you exclusively us silicone tools. I don't care what the manufacturer claims. Metal tools destroy non-stick surfaces. Use ONLY wood, or Silicone."
These are great to use and the variety of the sizes make them versatile for different cooking needs.
"Size and thickness are about right for ease of use for flipping everything from pancakes to eggs, works very well."
I use these everyday they are awesome no scratching my griddle and are very easy to clean
Works great. Won't scratch my pans.
Cleaning an ease!!
Very nice
Needed these!
Sturdy and good material
This is a sturdy well made tool ! I urge you to get one if you need it !!
This is a useful set that works as intended. And the price is right.
I bought these silicone spatulas to use in my air fryer. They are exactly what is shown in the ad and I use them often. I am very happy with these spatulas.
"I love these because they are sturdy and can slide under eggs, pancakes and other things without the spatula bending and messing everything up‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Before receiving this spatula life was dull, grim, and overall lacking purpose. The package arrived early and the bubble wrap was superb. Upon opening the envelope my eyes lit up - this was clearly ‚Äúthe One‚Äù. I can honestly say this spatula has changed my life for the better. Not only are my omelets coming out more refined and undoubtedly enhanced, but I‚Äôve overall been more inspired to be a better person. One of character, fortitude, and grandiosity. Thank you spatula, For making me a kinder, happier, and - dare I say - more spiritual, individual. Jakob"
"While this turner is quite sturdy, it's not as heat resistant as described. I used this less than 10 times on things like frying eggs or fish or stir fry, and already the coating at the edges has come off. Seems to melt. I rarely write bad reviews, however, I feel like the manufacturer really need to change the description on this product, because, the main feature I wanted from this was, heat resistance leading to durability. Unfortunately, this product does not seem to live up to it. Really disappointed."
"The spatula is exceptionally well balanced. That was the first thought that poppec into my head when I picked it up from its delivery box. It felt really good in my hand. And this is not the comment of someone just trying to sell the product, I‚Äôm an actual purchaser and user. To take this a step further, the cost of one labeled black2 was on sale, I purchased a second one the next day. Well balanced. OK just a joke but I wanted to prove a point. I wanted to cook something else just so I could use a spatula again. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ In other words, this is the best flipper I have ever owned. Would I buy it again, I already have."
"As always, Kitchen Aid has produced another success with this product. This pancake turner (or simply, ‚Äúturner‚Äù) is sturdy, crafted from material that will not scratch enamel-coated non-stick pans and withstands a good deal of heat. I do not know the exact level of heart that this turner will withstand because I‚Äôve not tested it; I didn‚Äôt want to destroy it. However, I‚Äôve used it to scrambled eggs and perform other tasks on the stovetop at high heat, and it performed well without curling or peeling. I should think that unless one held it directly in the fire of a gas range that it should be fine. I would highly recommend this product because of its durability and ease of cleaning."
I prefer egg/hamburger turners that are of a stiffer quality. Most are flimsy and the food that is being cooked slides off before I'm ready. This one is just right. The only complaint I have is that the handle is too long. The last one I had was a little shorter and was easier to use. I will make it work until I find a handle that is a bit shorter.
We own a lot of silicone spatulas but they do not do the same job as a plastic one. We bought two of these. They are great. They‚Äôre sturdy and easy to clean. They‚Äôre not too big or too small. The leverage from the handle is perfect. These are my favorite spatulas!
"Bought this for my husband, who does not like spatulas that break easily. This is very sturdy. Hoping it will last a while. So far, it is easy to clean, and there are no pieces coming off the end, which was another issue we had with others. Will update review if any issues in future."
"I've had quite a few spatulas in my life. I ran restaurants for some years. At home though, everything is non-stick needing plastic tools. Some of them are good, others look like the guy who designed them was drunk. This spatula falls into the very good range. Nice weight, good balance and the blade is at the proper angle for working."
"We own another Kitchen Aid spatula and it has lasted well compared to cheap brands that melt and flake quickly when used. This one is nicely made, have used it, and like it well. No issues with use or cleaning.... The only disadvantage is that it can't hang on a utensil hook...no hole in the handle. Since this brand lasts, it's not a big issue finding a different way of putting it away. I would buy it again."
"I mean wow! I thought my life was over when I broke my Spatula City spatula. I will miss Spatula City, it was the best store. Then here comes KitchenAid with a god tier spatula that has changed the spatula game for all time. One you have used this spatula, there is no going back. If you don't buy this spatula you will regret it."
"Had a nice scratch free unit that drove me nuts trying to clean it, had to use scratchy pads and scrapers. This one is a dream, works great, no heat damage and easy to clean . Best one I have had. Not to speak of a good price."
"KitchenAid makes a good product line, but I was not expecting this spatula to be quite so sturdy. It will be lovingly known as the Spatula From Hell in my kitchen, and I'm sure it will outlast me and at least one future generation."
Nice egg Turner. Purchased a Bella electric skillet that does not permit a metal egg Turner. Picked this plastic unit up at same time. Works well and is much sturdier that other flimsy plastic egg Turner I have used. Good price for a Kitchen Aid product.
A quality product that easily slips under the eggs and allows you to gently turn them over. Works well with any type of cookware surface or grill without scratching it.
"Solid little spatula, easy to clean and able to withstand some pressure. It‚Äôs not as wide as some but has a little more strength for lifting, and cutting and freeing stuff from the side of a pan, like lasagna or a casserole."
Need a fry turner. This one feels properly heavy and sturdy (in contrast to those thin and soft). So far so good. Recommended.
"This turner is wide enough to use on fried eggs, long enough to keep you away from the heat, and designed to provide a comfortable grip and wrist posture. Will not scratch non-stick pans, yet its edge is sharp enough to scrape up sticky or burned foodstuff."
"My previous spatulas had broken, melted or disappeared. This one is great for all my cooking purposes. Very, very sturdy, and dishwasher safe"
I always liked kitchenaide products. This is a good quality utensil in my opinion. It is sturdy and has a little weight to it. Unlike the ones sold in discount and dollar stores.
"This is sturdy, doesn‚Äôt melt with high temperatures and is easy to clean and I love that it is a good length and a good sturdy large surface to pick up an egg without breaking the yoke!!"
But a darn good one! This was the first piece of this collection that I purchased. It was so good that I purchased the rest.
"This spatula is extremely sturdy and stiff. So if you‚Äôre looking for a spatula that has a little bend to it, this is not the one for you. Works great for heavier foods and when you have to scrape at something."
This item was purchased as a gift. Well received.
Sturdy turner. Doesn't bend like so many cheaper ones.
"Just as I expected. Haven't used very much yet but it should work out fine for my purposes. Pretty large in size. Would be great for outside grill. I would have preferred the handle just a little less large for my stovetop use, but that is just my preference. Others may like it just the way it is. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
High quality and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. I highly recommend.
"The spatula is sturdy, easy to use and clean. id highly recommend"
This kitchen tool is the perfect size and washes easily.
Heat resistant and attractive. Well built and sturdy. Dishwasher safe. What more can you ask for?
Study handle so picking up is a breeze and the handle is long enough to keep away from the heat. Nice product.
"Great heat resistance, very sturdy and easy to clean"
Easy use Large face
"Good quality, perfect length."
"Well made and easy to use/clean, just slightly bigger than I thought."
"sturdy, heat resistant, easy to clean, flips well"
"Nice and solid. Replaced an older flimsy one, should have done that a long time ago. Will never go back to cheap ones after this."
This is a perfect spatula!
Bought this to replace my spatulas of 20 years. It is nice and sturdy and easy to clean!
I was surprised how heavy this thing is. Feels very sturdy and well-built. Works great with my non-stick pans when I need a stiff spatula
Just what I needed. Sturdy and stiff enough so I can flip over easy sggs perfectly. Great kitchen utencil.
Have used it for awhile now and have no complaints! Very sturdy and well made! Feels good in the hand!
Very sturdy... My other one seems so flimsy now next to it. Good buy
I like the size and ease to hold onto with the large handle.
Very well weighted. Seems very sturdy. Great purchase. Would buy again.
"No surprises, just a good sturdy spatula. Would recommend."
It's sturdiness is its best feature.
Good quality
I LOVE THIS ! ITS BIG TOO !
"Great quality, I‚Äôve used it to make eggs & grill burgers"
Love it !! Perfect for my husbands use!!!!!
Fine - should stand up better than the old one I had
"Very nice, very sturdy. At the same time light enough to use."
Exactly what I expected it to be. Very happy.
Heat resistant and very easy to use
Good and sturdy product I really like this.
Feels very nice and study. Pretty easy to clean and it came well packaged. My partner is very happy with it :)
Its sturdy and heat resistant
"Works well in the kitchen. Even with sustained use, it remains easy to clean (both with hands and dishwasher) and resists heat well. 10/10"
Liked long handle.
"It's incomprehensible to me how a product was rendered completely unusable on day 1 after I used it exactly as intended. The manufacturers must have never tested it on basic use cases. How can such a reputable company sell a tool that melts almost instantly in pans on medium heat?  The very first time I used this spatula/turner, I was frying pancakes on medium heat with a nonstick pan on a glass stovetop. I did not leave the turner sitting in the pan. I only touched it to the pan briefly while checking the bottoms of the pancakes and flipping them.  Nevertheless, the part at the tip already melted and re-hardened. When I touch that part with my fingers now, tiny black bits of material break off the melted end. I'm afraid some of these got into the pancakes accidentally.  I'll be buying a new silicone spatula/turner instead and using that in the future."
I expected a spatula and I got one!
As described very sturdy
Very sturdy
Good
Was a gift
"Sturdy, well-made, will stand up to the eggs that dare try to stick to the pain."
Works
It‚Äôs a bit too long
Works great no problems.
Great utensil! Flips eggs with ease.
"I am still looking for a spatula to replace my perfect one but it is wearing thin. This one was too think at the edge. The edge had a knob at the left corner of the lifting surface. Add to that, the thicker than desired spatula part had a big scar deep in the surface of the top. Bad. Bad. Bad. Please don't post.... it must have been a lemon."
"Better then expected, sturdy not floppy at all, edge is tapered enough to easily flip pancakes. I purchased this to go with my new nonstick pan so that it lasts longer and now I pretty much favor it over my other various wood and plastic spatulas. Cleans off super easy, I just hand-wash."
I could not rate the heat resistance because we simply do not keep it in a pan...just use to scoop up our food. LOVE how sturdy they are and of course dish washer cleans easily.
Non-stick might be a stretch; but dried on bacon grease came off VERY easily. Red color stands out nicely among the other utensils sharing a holder.
"This tool is ideal for cooking. The only comment would be if the tool blade was thinner, it would be easier to use in some of the pans."
"My son borrowed it to cook something in my kitchen and immediately wanted to know where I got it, he liked it so much. I use it daily and it looks as good as new. Definitely lives up to its description."
Better than the other two I ordered. Need to include size/comparisons/weights to help better select the correct turner
My husband hates it when eggs stick to the spatula. He is who encouraged me to buy this spatula. He loves it! No sticky eggs!
I ordered a few different brands to make sure that I got what I wanted. This is as expected. Easy to clean and sturdy.
Amazing spatula with Perfect size and heat resistant. It is dishwasher safe also. I would definitely recommend it.
"I‚Äôve been using this daily for over a month and it works well. It is not affected by the heat of the nonstick frying pan I use. It is easy to clean. The material is slightly flexible, so it bends to the contour of the pan."
It's sturdy and easy to work
Sturdy and just what I needed. So far so good.
For the money its a great deal
This is a great spatula for the price! My husband and I both love them!
This Turner works very well and I love the color!
Strong easy to clean
"Love this, great size and protects my Teflon cookware."
Sturdy quality. non-stick. great price for the quality
Good size and sturdiness for most kitchen applications. Helpful for protecting non-stick pans.
This is an awesome Spatula. Great quality and price!
x
Good product!
"This is the best non-metal spatula I have ever owned. The design and quality of construction are excellent. The shape of the spatula makes it easy to flip eggs, pancakes, meat or whatever you are cooking. Heat does not bother this spatula either. Flexibility is just right too. Would highly recommend to friends, family, and others."
"This spatula has a thicker end which makes it really hard to flip anything. It is difficult to clean and seems to leave a whitish residue on it. It's ok to stir with, but flipping not so much. I would not buy again"
What time came to the store I have customer try to pick up
"This spatula is only ok. The quality of the material is good, but the handle is round making it tipsy as you place it on the counter in between use (I prefer to rest it spatula side up as to not to get grease or oil on my counters). Also, I‚Äôve noticed that soap sticks to the material. I‚Äôve tasted soap on my food after washing this spatula with soap. So I now only wash it with hot water. An additional side note; the angle of the spatula and the material of the spatula itself makes it rather difficult to flip things at times (a few eggs and other things have slipped here and there -I don‚Äôt believe it to be an operator error). Unfortunately, I‚Äôm looking to purchase a different spatula. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
I was looking for a flat spatula but because I couldn‚Äôt see the clear picture on the list. I ended up buying the same one that i had. I have non stick pan and i fry eggs snd pancakes often. The spatula i have is a metal one so it was scratching my pan and i have to get a new one. This time i try to find the silicone spatula that very flat but this one is not flat enough.
No problems thus far.
I am so thrilled that this spatula is both somehow flexible but sturdy....as well as heat resistant. I kept melting the tip of spatulas when cooking at high temperatures on stove or oven. I don't know why I didn't get this type of spatula earlier! So far nothing has stuck to it.... very easy to clean. Love it!
"This is a very sturdy spatula. It's not cheap plastic and it's excellent for my Michelangelo cookware. Easy to clean, didn't show any staining when I used it to dish out my lasagna. It's everything the description says it is. I do not regret this purchase."
"Surprised no one's said this but this isn't even an orange spatula.  I got it to match my hanging kitchen utensils and pulling out of the packaging instant disappointment. It's milky pale since that semi-opaque coating goes over the whole thing. But even the core color under that is plainly a peach hue.  Kids liked it alright, not picky, so we kept it."
I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy using this spatula as I thought it looked a little cheap. The grip is excellent and the material has a nice feel. The smaller size of this spatula is good for those smaller items and to use as a second spatula to flip such things as an egg. And I really like the red color.
"Extremely happy with the color. Reds are hard to match when you are looking at a computer screen, but this is exactly the right color for my kitchen. (For amateur painters, it's very close to a cadmium red, i.e., no obvious blue just red with a hint of yellow.) It is much sturdier than other silicone utensils I have tried, holds up to heat well and is very easy to clean."
I had just melted the handle on a spatula. UGH. That is when I looked to amazon for a pretty solution. I have mixing spatulas that are heat resistant and I love them. So having one I can fry eggs with is perfect. I got blue so I could easily spot it in my drawer. I love that I don't have to worry about it melting. Goes thorough the diswasher just fine too! :-).
"I grew up in a time when we didn't have utensils in such fun colors and styles. Heat resistance was a problem back then, too--so usually, your choices were metal or wood. I just love utensils like this silicone nonstick turner! The color is so cheerful and the texture is great. The turner does its job, it resists heat, and it's easy to clean. What more could one want in one little turner?"
"I love spatulas made of 100% silicone. They simply ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô in the frying pan. I purchased on at another store and tried to find another. Impossible. Hard to find 100% silicone, no metal, no plastic."
"After a few days of use, it seems just fine. The plastic blade is a bit thick. That's a good thing because it is stiffer. There is a bevel on the edge so that you shimmy it under the foot despite the thickness. It cleans up well in the top rack of my dishwasher."
"Me encanto el color,su tama√±o y lo f√°cil de usar ,f√±acil de limpiar y resistente al calor,no como esos tipicos de las tiendas que son de un pl√°stico que se derrite si les da un calor muy fuerte al fre√≠r un huevo.LO RECOMIENDO,BUEN UTENSILIO DE COCINA,SENCILLO Y PR√ÅCTICO."
"Decent spatula, works well. It feels lighter than my other 2, but the thin-ness makes it better at flipping eggs. Will have to see how long it lasts. You can see my other red one of unknown brand has developed blisters, but the black one of around same age (couple years old) is as good as new."
"Meh. Was looking for a flipper that was less wide than most. This one is good for that. Silicone seems to resist heat, but the whole thing is just a bit too flexible in my opinion (not as sturdy as expected). Not bad for the price, just don't expect a life-long kitchen companion."
"I have used it for eggs , hamburgers , and grilled cheese. I like it but do find it a little tricky to flip eggs or get them out of pan. It is very sturdy for chopping up hamburg for tacos . I bought another one after using my first one because it is so sturdy."
"I‚Äôd bought more utensils like this one, a ladle & others - wouldn‚Äôt want to cook with anything else. They handle high temperatures & clean up easy ‚Ä¶ & definitely worth the price"
"I am switching my utensils over to silicone it‚Äôs my new fav and if you haven‚Äôt tried silicone go for it! This spatula is amazing, heavy duty and easy to clean. For the price as well I absolutely recommend it."
"Amazing quality slotted spoon. Feels good in the hand, sturdy and just over all a good quality piece of equipment. Why the one star review then you might ask? Well.. My main issue is I can't flip eggs or pancakes with it and I really had my heart set on that, which us why I ordered a turner rather than a spoon in the first place."
"This thing is perfect for cooking eggs on a non-stick pan. The tip is flexible and allows you to press down on the pan to get under whatever it is you're cooking. It holds up perfectly to the dishwasher, but not to large dogs. I've owned three of these because dog teeth go right through the handle and spatula"
I didn't think it would be as good as advertised but it truly has held up to serious heat like very hot oil. No clue what the temperature is but it's held up better than any we've had. Only con is that it's thicker at the end so that's makes it a little harder to get under things to flip them. We're getting better with it. But great overall.
I bought this to go with a new frying pan which couldn‚Äôt use metal tools. It works well and is sturdy. Dishwasher safe.
Works well in a pan won‚Äôt scratch your pots or pans good weight not to heavy flips food easily. Scraps the sides of your pans to assure all clear like a spatula
First time that I used this a piece of the end came off. The end is not very sturdy at all. Not the best for frying eggs.
I love the lightness of the spatula. It's very easy to use or someone small hands or hands that are weaker. Washes up easily.
"This spatula isn't sturdy enough to flip burgers or anything else in my non stick pans. The plastic is too soft. Wouldn't recommend, unfortunately."
This is made perfectly....can easily get under food to turn it over. Thank you!
I returned this item bc it seemed too thick to actually get under delicate eggs etc
"Excelente inversion,facilita cualquier manipulacion de alimentos Gracias"
Folks say kitchen item a can be purchased cheaper and they're right...but they melt and curl up. Great item!
"Too stiff, asked for subtle. These are way too hard."
Just what I was looking for. It is full sized but works well with my smallest frying pan due to the angled shape. The price was nice too.
"I guess I'm the only one who had a problem with this piece of crap chipping. Before I even used it, the corner chipped off! Not even worth returning. Wish I had not been fooled by the positive reviews."
"This seems sturdy, washes easily and the black looks good in my kitchen."
So far so good. Seems to hold up to heat better than other spatulas I‚Äôve used.
I like this turner. It is a good size for turning foods. Easy to use. I like the length of the handle.
"This spatula works well, cleans up easily and matches closely to other silicone cooking tools I have."
Perfect size and really non-stick
Does exactly what it is supposed to do. No problems with it. Love it.
"This spatula is nice and sturdy, easy to wash. Use on Teflon type pans to avoid scratches. My favorite color too!"
Replacing nylon spatula but have not made anything that I need a spatula at this time.
I love the way eggs don't stick to the material this is made of. but the edge is alittle thick to turn eggs
We had one of these in red and after years of use it developed a hole in the silicone. I was so happy to find these to replace our old ones. Love the color and these are the best turners ever!
I mean it works but it‚Äôs super cheap silicone and quality. I would not buy again.
Very sturdy.
"A++++ Firm, sturdy, and easy to clean. That‚Äôs all I needed. Also something large, for bigger dishes (i.e. pizza/ lasagna). Served it‚Äôs purpose. I‚Äôm sure you could find cheaper options, but from my experience, you get what you pay for."
"Finally, a spatula edge that does not disintegrate when it gets hot. You can still get it underneath an egg to turn it..."
"For the price, I would not have expected this good of quality. It's really a nice set."
They work great and clean up nice and aren‚Äôt to big
Great quality for the price.
So fancy and work great!
Surprising level of quality for the price!
Sturdy
works good while cooking
Very good
"The mini spatulas are surprisingly very useful--I thought I was just going to donate them. The four larger pieces seemed like a good enough value to order this set.  Fit and finish was not impressive out of the package. But after a few weeks of use, everything has held up well to cooking and the dishwasher. And again, I've already used the mini spatulas many many times. I had to lightly peel remnants of silicone from most of the spatulas after unboxing. The remnants were barely attached scraps from molding of the spatulas. No evidence these scraps existed after the first run through the dishwasher. This is a no name brand but so far comparable to other tools as offered by brands like OXO."
the one-piece design makes these spatulas super easy to use and clean. I didn't know how many uses I would find for the difference sizes until I had them. I would recommend to anyone who cooks a lot.
"I don‚Äôt know why they are called spatulas,the biggest one is shaped like a spoon and the largest flat one is petty sad. I would return but probably make stocking stuffers.Merry Christmas"
"Forc Silicone Spatula Set is absolutely perfect; materials, usability, multiples and performance. They just endured a marathon prep session and we have nothing but praise (still three unused!). All of the pieces are substantial; obviously created with adult cooks in mind. The edges are thin enough to scrape residue off our baking mat without force or damage to the mat. Major plus: Nonstick- all pieces clean up easily. Perfection."
"I like that these are one piece, they are not very firm though, so scraping a side of a bowl is difficult because the spatula just bends over the frosting or whatever you are mixing."
I love these spatulas because they are one piece and easy to clean. No more food stuck in crevices. They are very strong yet flexible. And the variety of sizes is great. They did not come with the Forc name on them so not sure if they are genuine but they are great nevertheless.
"These are sturdy and comfortable to use, with a size/shape for most purposes. I find myself reaching for them more and more often above my older ones, and I'm using ones I didn't think I'd use as much. These are a great bargain."
These are very sturdy and the length and size of them are good. I‚Äôm a man with large hands and these are very well sized. There is a assortment of sizes and lengths for every use. From small bottles and jars to large mixing bowls. I think they are just great.
These are nice sturdy spatulas for a good price. I like all the different sizes for different applications. I got the red color and it looks great. So far they are holding up nicely.
I am returning these. They are far too big and clunky for my pans and they feel heavy in my hands. And I‚Äôm not sure one of the pieces won‚Äôt scratch my nonstick pans.
"they are too small and very flimsy looking. A regular spatula is about 3"" wide. The largest of these are 2"". The tinny things - some are 1/4"" wide - must be for arts and craft. I couldn't find use for them..."
I love to bake. These silicone tools helped make that job easier! I ordered this set for the mini tools and have yet to use them!
"SHIESTER!!! bad product that breaks in less thatn 2 months. but i cant return????? thanks for stealing my money,."
I don't use all of them and as I am curious as to what to do with some of them but I reach for them all of the time. I love them and they clean so easily!
"I washed them upon receipt, and have only used 1 so far. Worked fine. Washed easily."
"Awesome combination of pieces. Makes life in the Kitchen so much easier. Throw away the old wooden spoons. These are my new, go-to cooking utensils!"
The smaller ones started to melt. The pan was on a LOW burner & I was stirring. It wasn't even high heat or just left sitting. I don't believe the small ones are really silicon probably just basic plastic. The larger ones have worked okay so far.
"Just what I needed, small ones for the coffee grinder. All others replace the overheated bent ones."
Like that it is one molded piece and food doesn‚Äôt get stuck in the groves
I'm 69 yrs old and have used alot of different spatulas in my time but these spatulas are the BEST EVER!!
"These arrived exactly as described with no missing items and they work as expected. In short, no surprises and no regrets."
"This is a perfect set of spatulas, extremely sturdy and a size for each need. The wife loves them!"
Very good quality.
"I use these things all of the time, live them."
small ones are very small and you dont need this many smalls
The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it shows a bit of a white film from running in dishwasher
I absolutely love these and especially all the sizes that come together. I've used them almost daily.
"These are great. Bought 2 months ago, holding up to daily use/dishwasher cycles"
I like the size of all the pieces. Especially the thin ones to get into small bottle opening. And I use the small thin ones for my face cream jars.
Have only used 1 spatula so far & it was sturdy and easy to clean. I'm looking forward to using the jar spatulas to see how effective they are to use. I like to get every drop out of a product given the price of merchandise.
Great product and very happy with it. Fast shipping and great company!!!!
Different sizes. One for almost any size jar.
I really like this set! It has a spatula for every need! They are very sturdy and heat resistant. Also they are all one piece so they are very easy to clean.
Slightly disappointed as actual spatula's that we needed are not part of the package we received.
The spatulas are a little flimsy making it hard to stir heavier foods.
"They are the best! They are made very well. Easy to work with, especially because they gone in different sizes."
Perfect !
Works great and love the different sizes
Just what I needed for my non stick pots and pans.
I have not use that much yet
This set is so nice. I love it!
Love them. I would suggest these.
Great utensils especially for baking.
Perfect for my needs! Easy clean up and great quality!
Really sturdy
Purchased in August 2021 and the small spatula fell apart December 2021
Love the durability and different sizes
Very versatile and useful! Niw I can get every last bit of Dijon out of the jar!
"Why should I rate for an item that I didn't receive. I received the Crystals for Beginners book, nothing else."
Love these medium hard rubber spatchulas! I would buy them again or for a present!
Very well put together but for me items were too heavy. Sounds weird but when you get older ones hands don't have the strength.
Great spatula set. If I needed more I would buy them again.
Right for the price.
The product quality is better than my expiration
Long spatula to clean jars
Not impressed
The silicon spatulas are to thick and the bigger one is totally not useful for me
Items were much larger than anticipated. I will be returning
This product arrived with water inside the packaging. Gross.
"If you want a thicker wooden spoon - this is NOT for you!!! But I had one for years that I really liked and was having trouble finding a similar spoon anywhere. This is a THIN spoon, but I use it so often for stirring large pots of sauce and when cooking in non-stick cookware. Hoping they hold up as well as my OLD spoon and so far, they seem to be doing the job! And the price!!!!! Figured I'd better order a couple more before they sell out never to return again!"
I have been trying to replace all of my plastic cooking utensils with bamboo wooden ones because it‚Äôs safer for cooking. I love this spatula! It‚Äôs just about 12‚Äù long so it‚Äôs a good size. It‚Äôs a great price too! I have a few other bamboo utensils and this matches them perfectly. I love cooking scrambled eggs with it!
"At first glance I thought it flimsy. To my surprise this thin-tipped spatula is a silent workhorse. I use it for wok cooking, but also for sauteing veggies in enameled cookware. It wont scratch. It's quiet, lightweight and easy to clean. I love it."
"I purchased these for my husband as we had a wooden spatula that was wearing out. He likes these and uses them frequently. His only area of disappointment was he would prefer the ends to be thinner. Otherwise, I consider this a perfect find."
"It is a sturdy spatula but it‚Äôs scary washing it, I feel like I am going to get splinters because it is fraying so much. Not the best quality"
"The product is untreated bamboo as far as I can tell. after a few uses, it was stained and hard to clean."
He loves them.
Love it for my stir Frys.
The bamboo is not coated and is rough even before the first use.
This spatula has met my expectations.
"I do like the simplicity of this design. It's a basic, well-designed and effective kitchen tool. It is efficient in a wok, it's slim enough to get under fish and flip it nicely (it could be a bit longer, but it works), and it's made of a renewable resource. There's really nothing to dislike about it and it's my opinion that this is a tool that should be in even the most basic of kitchens. Both beginner and expert cooks will find themselves reaching for this on a routine basis. I like it and recommend it."
"I love my wooden spoons and really like the bamboo spatula. It's light and just as you would imagine. I like using it for all sorts of purposes, but do feel like it doesn't soak in water or moisture as some wooden spoons do. So far, works great!"
"I love this spatula. Why, you might ask? It's a spatula. Well, because it has a flat bottom. That's perfect for deglazing a pan. Why more spatulas don't have a flat bottom is beyond me, but this is fantastic. Highly recommended."
This spatula has thicker tip than I would like. It looks unfinished.
These are super thin and definitely won't last long!
"These spatulas are great for general use as well as with non-stick pans. I prefer them to the black plastic spatulas that we have been using for non-stick pans. They are a little thicker than most spatulas and they are not my first choice for flipping eggs, but they are great for deglazing."
Excellent
Easy to clean and well made
"I have been looking for one of these, and here it is. My other one was a wooden one and bigger, but I am happy with it."
If you do any baking at all these knives make your life so much simpler. The off center knife is perfect for spreading icing or butter when making cinnamon rolls. I used it just this morning when spreading out the stick of butter on the dough before the sugar and cinnamon go on. Also great for caking icing or spreading icing on any baked good. Reasonably priced and easy clean up make these a nice addition to any kitchen. A few of the things that makes life a little easier if you cook.
"All those chrome kitchen flippers hanging like ripe fruit at my grocery beckoned, but I could see they weren't flexible enough. I remembered those spatulas in my mom's kitchen and searched on line. Glad I did. These old fashion, thin, flexible tools are perfect. Not only can one spread icing, but they are thin enough to remove corned beef from a can in a whole chunk. No other tool in my kitchen can do that!"
"When it comes to baking, I'm decent at bread, but not much else. I needed these for spreading dough, and they worked well for my needs. I particularly like the different sizes. This was my first time to use this type of tool, and I got the hang of it quickly. I would buy again. I assume the longer the blade, the more finesse is needed to keep a straight carve/cut. In any case, I really like these."
Good price and good workmanship suitable and sufficient for different tasks in cake decorating for home use.
"Needed to replace my list cake decorating spatulas and these babies came in handy. Easy to hold, easy to use, great quality."
These have a bit more flex than expected however we‚Äôre not making works of art and it‚Äôs easy enough to adjust. The variety of sizes are handy. We might upgrade in the future if we decide 1-2 sizes are all we need. At the price though it‚Äôs really hard to beat!
I use these for my professional business. They are comparable to Wilton products. The plastic handle is very grippable and does not slide.
Good price
"Not only great for baking, but great for shepherds pie, lasagna and other savory dishes."
Utiles y comodos para realizar el trabajo deseado.
Acceptable. Good for light use. Is as advertised though.
These baking spatulas are great. Arrived on time and a fantastic price. Will be using them quite often.
Good angle. Makes it easier.
"Four great spatulas for one low price! Perfect for my grandkids to use, go right in the dishwasher and have very sturdy plastic handles! Very happy with my order!"
Quality/price... Can't be beat for home baking!!
Gave as gifts to friends who did not have frosting spatulas.
Very good icing spatulas easy to clean
Everyone should have this set
I am starting a new cake decorating class and needed theses item... i was really surprised at the quality and especially the great price
Great combination
"I love them, I‚Äôve always wanted good ones and when I got this one it was bigger than I expected! Super easy to clean, dried quickly, nothing scraped off at all. No complaints c:"
As described
"Heat resistant,easy clean,sturdy blades for decorating."
Cake decorating
Nice gift for somebody
Better than I expected. Very happy with this set.
I like everything one set for good price ..
Easy to hold works well for decorating
This was a very inexpensive set for the quality and number of items.
Great value and they work...
Perfect feel in hand and iced a cake still in a 9x13 glass pan very cleanly.
Good for the price. Quality is also decent. Maybe if you‚Äôre a 5 star chef you may not like them. They do the job and do it more.
Great product and service.
Teaching grdkids how to take over my cake decorating
A kitchen must
nice assortment
It has a good grip
Nice
Variety of sizes at a great price
Great craftsmanship at a remarkable price !
Love it
Sturdy spatulas! Easy to use & great for beginners! Great price.
Nice product.
"True to size, does the job well, handle is flat so it can be uncomfortable for some people."
"Me agrado el material,la calidad y r√°pido env√≠o. Lo utilizo para mis bizcochos"
"Son buenas, las angulares no vienen tan dobladas pero sirven para trabajar!"
"When I received this I recognized right away that the ‚Äúoffset‚Äù part of the spatula isn‚Äôt offset enough. The one on the bottom is from this set I purchased. The one on the top is one I picked up at the local Hobby Lobby. Notice that the one on the top has much more angle, which is what you need. To boot, this item is not returnable."
I was looking forward to having an offset spatula set.
"Items came in old looking packing that looks as if it had been in someone's junk drawer and pack had been opened and closed several times catching lint ans dirt . They have rust on them!! Thanks for someone's used utensils, seller won't even let me return . Gross."
Seems sturdy enough. Large handles need large hands. Package MISSING CAKE SCRAPERS.
This is a solid set for the price. I appreciate the range of sizes and they have nice thick grips which makes them easy to use. My only concern is that the metal is a little flimsy which made using them to move cakes - something these spatulas are used for frequently - a little iffy.
It is not stainless steel as the seller claimed. Item started to rust after couple of uses. I would not buy. It is garbage. You also can not return it.
Easy to hold and frost. Perfect for beginners
"I like the size and already rusting around handle after couple washings in dishwasher, maybe should was by hand and dry with dish towel."
Exactly what I was looking for and wanted. Work great!
This is cheapest item that I have ever purchased
My 7 year old daughter loves to bake. These tools were great for our baking sessions!
"I actually use these for painting on canvas. They work just as good as pricy art supply versions. These are a little cheap, but great value for the price."
"I was hoping to receive the angled spatulas like it is seen in the pictures of the product but they ended up having very little angle, therefore there was no need to buy them. The angled spatulas are supposed to be very helpful when frosting cakes because it can easily scrape off excess frosting, but the ones provided in this pack are too flat to accomplish this successfully. I would recommend you look for another seller."
Helpful for beginer to used from kitchen.
The longer ones came in bent but a little forceful persuasion and it is good as new... For the price it's worth it.
I bought these to decorate my granddaughter‚Äôs birthday cake. It‚Äôs a really good set easy to use and the cake turned out great.
"I ordered this set because it came with spatulas and scrappers. When I received the item the package was open and I was missing the scrappers. In attempts to report the error I was unable to do so and had to order an extra set separately. So I can only speak on behalf of the spatulas received. The set seems well made and is easy to hold and manipulate as needed for frosting purposes. In rating of the spatulas only I would have given 4 stars, since I did not receive the full set as ordered I am only giving 2"
Spatulas were NOT as sturdy as I expected and could be easily twisted!
"The offset spatula is almost flat. When I attempted to return it, I discovered it was not returnable. The return policy on this particular item was not visible to allow you to know what you are getting into (shame on Amazon). I had selected these spatulas because there were four of them for less money than others. Now the way I see it, the seller needed to offload them so priced them lower."
Just an okay product.
Muy bueno excelente producto
"I bought these thinking that they were a smaller set, such as a beginner set. When they arrived they are ridiculously large and VERY bendy. While I can make them work the size is obnoxious and very hard to deal with."
Great price
"I was looking for various sizes, these were mostly big."
KUFUNG Stainless Steel Handle Silicone nonstick spatula is an awesome addition to my new ceramic electric skillet. I love it.
"I have been looking for something like this for a long time. The size is just right, it‚Äôs easy to stir and the food doesn‚Äôt stick to it. I love it so much that I bought 2 more, one for my daughter and one for future use."
Five stars on all accounts. Definitely recommend and will buy again.
I was doubtful that this was truly non stick but I was so wrong. This is amazing!
Was looking for reasonably priced silicone replacement for very old nylon one I managed to melt. Like it so we‚Äôll have ordered two more utensils in the same brand.
"I have tried numerous spatulas they were flimsy, finally this one is sturdy, no bending especially when trying to flip an egg!!"
"I use to flip my fish and chicken in pan, works well, then i put in dishwasher, happy with purchase!"
It works great for my air fryer
Won‚Äôt scratch new non stick pan.
I was pleasantly surprised by the weight and studiness of this spatula.
Eggs haven‚Äôt stuck yet.
Perfect for frying eggs and turning them over. Long handle very handy too!
Easy clean up with no staining from red chile from New Mexico.
These are well built and get the job done. Perfect for making bacon and eggs in the morning. Satisfied with purchase and would buy again.
Must be the Rolex of flipper floppers works like a dream
Easy to clean. Seems durable.
Great tool for my new skillet
Good product quality.
Does great job for a little money
Heat and chip-resistant-so far so good!
"Sturdy and nice, better than expected for this price."
I have a picky son with kitchen utensils and he finally loves something I purchased. I LOVE this tool!
Just what I was looking for.
Mice looking spatula
right size
I tend to burn spatulas up when I use the plastic kind and silicone spatulas are often too thick to get under an overeasy egg.This spatula checks all the boxes.
Easy to clean
Easy to clean
Took a chance without reviews and I'm pleasantly surprised...its exactly as the add describes. Eggs don't stick...its firm enough to flip omelettes and hash brown too. I like it so much that I am buying a second one. My kids love to make breakfast and leave me their dirty dishes...the non stick feature saves me aggrevation since I am doing dishes that aren't mine. I'm a happy with it and my kids like it too bc the handle isn't too short...so no worries about accidental burns. Buy it...its worth the money.
"Heat resistance, easy to use"
Works as expected.
"PROS: This spatula is flexible rather than firm (other than the metal part) and I like the soft feel. Most importantly, it‚Äôs easy to clean by hand and doesn‚Äôt melt in boiling oil at all, which is better than my previous spatula.  CON: It‚Äôs a bit small. I have no trouble flipping fish fillets or pancakes because they are large, single pieces and the spatula easily slides underneath them. However, when I have many small items to flip, like thin potato fries on a baking sheet, then it‚Äôs a hassle because it takes a while to flip all of them with the small spatula.  CONCLUSION: This is a good product and I would buy a larger version of it again."
"Nice spatula, metal covered with silicone that has sharp edges. A problem occurred with a similar spatula, as I expect may happen with this spatula, which is that excessive edge pressure will break the thin, but strong, silicone layer at the internal metal edge, and the metal will come through. Thus, the spatula should be used accordingly."
"I was looking for a 2.5"" wide spatula for a specific reason. This was advertised as 2.57"". It's not, it's actually much closer to 3"" which for me was a too wide for my need. Still, it's a good product."
Too large to be useful; the big rubber handle prevented it from going into my utensil pot; the operative part of the spatula was too thick and rubbery to pick up even a pancake cleanly. I wound up tossing it out.
It was not as described. It showed to be easy to bend and it is not. Would not order again
"I buy silicone on ceramic to keep flip eggs without sticking, and I like it so much I seldom use anything else for other foods as well. I wish they were more easily available, but glad that Amazon carries them."
"This is a sturdy product that works as expected, however, it doesn‚Äôt stay looking new for very long. The black of the silicone faded significantly from the first wash. I am not convinced it‚Äôs dishwasher-compatible, and that‚Äôs a big downside in convenience for me."
"I've been looking for a good Silicone nonstick spatulas and I've finally found one. What more can I say, it's well made, does the job and is easy to clean, it's a keeper!"
"The spatula has a nice long handle and is both sturdy enough and thin enough to lift meat or fish with ease. Silicone does not melt at normal cooking temperatures, another plus. But I do wish it were perforated to drain grease from the bottom of the cooked food."
This spatial has a nice long head & handle..I haven‚Äôt burnt my fingers flipping pancakes and for cookies it really easy to get them off the sheet..
Used maybe ten times. Right size and sturdiness to flip egg without breaking yolk; tapered leading edge slides right under veggie burger and large enough to support whole veggie burger so no crumbled patty when flipping. Only thing don't like is how extraordinarily long handle. Why so long?
"This is peace of junk. Came out of dishwasher covered in some white residue, so I washed it again by hands. When it dried up - same residue appeared again... and again.. I don't know what this spatula was made of, but wont be using it."
Only spatula I used due to holding up with cast iron and not scratching or melting from heat
"I just love this spatula. :)  Great quality, and just as described. I recommend."
"Started off great, but then one of the corners got hot and it started to fall off and left a black powder like substance on everything. It happened just after I could return it and I threw it out before I could take a picture of it. I really liked it to start, but then it went downhill from there."
"Unbranded. However, works well and is inexpensive."
This spatula is ok. It ultimately is not a great spatula.
"For the price, I expected a heavier spatula. Sometimes, you don't always get what you pay for. Still going to use it though."
So much nicer than my half melted spatula. Would buy again.
Very sturdy and easy to clean.
"Slightly smaller flipper than normal, just what I was looking for. Very sturdy, should stand up well."
I love how sturdy this spatula is - not bendable and flimsy like too many.
"Sturdy, easy to handle, and great for flipping pancakes."
It is quite resistant to high temperatures while cooking and has helped me with many dishes and preparations.
"Muy buen producto y muy buena calidad,buen precio"
Worls as advertised
"Ergonomic. Thin edge. Looks nice. Haven't used a lot, but I'm not expecting problems."
and it fits in the draw!
"Finally I found these, perfect and easy to use. Great quality as well."
"Sturdy with just enough flexibility. Made well, happy with purchase."
its a good stury spatula
"Sturdy, functional and sails through the dishwasher. Had to off gas for awhile."
Very good quality nice spatula all my kitchen utensils are this lime green just love the color
It's very sturdy and very easy to clean
I was quite impressed with the heft of this spatula; it's really solid and has some weight to it. Love it!
Handle is not flat like I thought. I can live with it Of course I have not tried pancakes yet on my small griddle to see if the handle matters. Other than that it works as expected
"Easy to clean, pretty, and it is very sturdy"
Works Real Great !!!
I feel like it‚Äôs a bit silly to write a review for this bc it‚Äôs a spatula but I honestly love it! I got the red one and it‚Äôs so easy to clean and has held up well.
"Easy to use, perfect size,gives more control when cooking."
Quality item. Sturdy. Lasting well after months of use and being tossed in the dishwasher.
Perfect! Very sturdy and easy to clean.
I like this it works well with my griddle
"El producto es excelente, resistente al calor, justo lo que venden"
Really nice quality! It‚Äôs a good size and feels sturdy. The picture on my cutting board is me pressing pretty hard on the silicone part and it does not bend! I bought the flat spatula and the slotted spatula. Both are great. I like that I was able to pick a handful of really nice quality silicone and wood tools from this shop rather than get a huge set of cheap tools that most other sellers are offering.
"It's a wok spatula or spoon with a nice ""silicone"" working end and a wooden handle that just feels cheap. Granted it's not the most expensive wok spoon so I wasn't expecting much but for some reason the attachment of the silicone to the wood handle just feels flimsy. Time will tell, who knows this thing just might surprise me. I also purchased an all wood wok spoon from another vendor that feels much sturdier and I'll be carving a few wok tools to add to the collection. But if I had to order again, I'd just buy the wooden spoon and skip this silicone one."
"As small as it looks, it doers a remarkable job of flipping eggs in the pan! It flipped over-easy eggs and omelets eaisly last breakfast time and it cleans very easily with just soap and water! I wouldn't put it in a dishwasher though, because of the beautiful wooden handle!!!"
"I gave my chef husband a wok with this utensil for Fathers Day. He loves them both, but uses this utensil every single day. I may just go ahead and get another while I‚Äôm here. He said it‚Äôs perfect."
"Well made, easy to clean and comfortable to use."
could not lift the tortilla to flip... edge needs to be thinner and more wide... so you can push the spoon under the tortilla and then flip
Great spatula flipper. Work and function exactly as intended with out melting up. No more micro plastics in food or for the world!
"Great for non-stick pots&pans, easy cleanup, love the angled head!"
I did no dislike anything about it
A very simple spatula and very nice on the pans
"The flat part of the spatula has a very weak connection to the handle, bending all the way back (see photo). Totally worthless."
The size of spatula is a tad small but still works well for certain use cases. East to clean and the wood handle is sturdy
Ill buy it again. Its a good product. Wish it qas wider tho. Lol
Well made product
"Works great, sturdy, easy to clean!"
Easy to use and a reasonable price.Looks nice
Quality is way better than the one I had before
"I was happy with it for the first couple of months, but now the silicone is starting to break at the thinnest part."
Good for price
To flexible for my taste. I should have done better research.
"right size, good angle on handle design and good hand feel"
"and it‚Äôs flexible enough to get into square corners of glass dishes!  This smaller spatula is another winner from KUFUNG. It‚Äôs made of BPA free silicone and has an integrated wooden handle that‚Äôs almost seamless. The length is about 12‚Äù and the widest part of the ‚Äúflipper‚Äù is 3 inches or so. This utensil can handle very high heat, (up to 600 degrees) and won‚Äôt be ruined on the grill or turning stuff in the oven.  It‚Äôs easier to hold these smaller utensils with my arthritic hands especially since I don‚Äôt use really large pans too often anymore. I can put the huge spatula away for family events and keep this one out in the bin for my regular small portion use.  All things considered, easy to use and clean at a great price ‚ú®"
"I have been strictly wood, plastic, and stainless when it comes to cooking utensils, so I am new to the silicone cooking utensils. Wood eventually gets gross and stained, plastic can melt and is extremely wasteful, stainless isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù when cooking/mixing. I guess I can admit that I have truly been missing out with silicone...  - SUPER EASY to wash and clean - Cooking is great with this spatula/turner - Easy to ‚Äúscrape‚Äù pan with this - Does not scratch or damage my pots/pans/plates etc  10/10 would recommend! I hope to make the full switch and swap all my plastic cooking utensils to silicone soon."
"I've been using this spatula with my air fryer which has a non-stick coating. The spatula part is on the small size, which makes it the perfect tool for my air fryer where food is close together but not touching. The edge of the paddle is graduated to be very thin, and there is a nice structure to the rest of the paddle. It's not flimsy. It's easy to flip things over as well as remove them. I like the wooden handle. No, don't put this in the dishwasher. Wood+dishwasher don't mix. It's easy to hand wash in 5 seconds. Nothing sticks to it."
"I got this when I got a new frying pan. I tried using the spatula I had, but it wasn't angled enough, so I had difficulty flipping everything. This spatula has a really nice angle on the head, so I can flip with ease. I really like that the size of the head is right in the middle of the range. It's perfect for flipping an egg, making a grilled cheese sandwich and stuff like that. The silicone head is also very stable and not too bendy. It's very sturdy with a nice wooden handle. I gave this 3 stars because there's a design flaw. The problem is where the wood handle meets the silicone spatula. There's no seal between the 2 and when water gets in there the wood soaks it right up. So while it says it's dishwasher safe, it really isn't unless you want to eventually ruin the handle. It also puts into question how long these will actually hold up. Luckily I haven't put this spatula into the dishwasher, but I found the flaw when I washed the spoonula I got from the same company with the same wooden handle. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice quality silicone spatula that works wonderfully. I just like to point out things that could be potential issues in the future."
It is a well-built spatula and feels solid. My 2 cents below:  Pros: - Very good built quality with wooden handle - It is strong and feels solid while using - Heat resistant up to 600¬∞F - Good for non-stick cooking and especially while making eggs or pancakes - It is good sized spoon being 12-inch tall  Cons: - The joint where the wooden handle connects to silicone has deep grooving and not sanded equally. Reducing 1 star for that reason since it makes cleaning tedious since grease might settle at that area
"This is a great choice if you are looking for a smallish spatula for non-stick surfaces.  The silicone is food grade, BPA free, and great for protecting non-stick surfaces.  The wooden handle is well-made and has a nice smooth finish that should hold up over time and has a hole in the end if you choose to hang it up.  The spatula itself if nice and firm for lifting and flipping with a flexible beveled end for getting under things.  The attachment between the wooden handle and the silicone spatula is good quality with no signs of looseness, fragility, or spinning."
"Wooden Handle Silicone Serving Spoon, KUFUNG Nonstick Mixing Spoon, Heat resistant up to 480¬∞F. Silicone Kitchen Cooking Utensils Non-Stick Baking ToolGrey)  This spatula is nice and sturdy. It has a nicely shaped wooden handle and a durable silicone serving spoon. It does not scratch my cookware and washes easily. I have used this spatula many times and the silicone has not broken or come apart in any way. Overall, it is a great spatula for how affordable it is."
"I have a few others from this group and they are fabulous utensils. So sturdy, both the wood handle and the piece itself. I was really pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect it to be of such high quality with it's reasonable price. It's heat resistant and the Silicone won't scratch your non-stick cookware or melt under high temperatures. The kitchen utensil handle is made of solid-wood and it's Easy to clean. I'm very happy with this; a very good value."
"Over the years we‚Äôve owned many turning type spatulas and they generally end up melting around the edges or sometimes even breaking. Myself and my wife had requested two different type silicone spatulas from KUFUNG on Amazon to try. And although this particular one did stand up to high temperatures extremely really well like the mixing one we tried, overall it didn‚Äôt quite measure up. Which is a little disappointing since this one does look much nicer aesthetically. Also, we wanted to point out that this silicone spatula doesn‚Äôt appear to damage your coated pans, like the metal or even hard plastic type spatulas can and it has just the right amount of flexibility in our opinion which makes it easier to use. But, even though the silicone end is perfect for things like frying up some eggs and Corn Beef Hash until it‚Äôs crispy, the nice looking wood handle is the big issue we had with this one. The description said it was dishwasher safe, however ours didn‚Äôt actually hold up to washing in our dishwasher after only 3 washes. I would like to mention that it‚Äôs possible it might fare better in some other type dishwashers, since ours is designed to heat the water up extra hot for sanitizing dishes and maybe that‚Äôs what broke down the integrity of the handle. So because of that we‚Äôre still going to give this spatula 3 Stars and would just recommend to not clean it in the Dishwasher even though the description says it‚Äôs okay. With all that being said, I want to emphasize that this particular item was provided to us at no cost through Amazon Vine. Vine reviewers aren‚Äôt actually employed by Amazon and never receive compensation for reviewing the items provided to us.

I have several kufung products and I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with this brand. The price point is incredible for how well made and high end these kitchen utensils feel. I mainly use my spatula for flipping grill cheeses. And my previous plastic spatula had been melting on the edge from touching the hot pan. No melting with this kufung silicone spatula at all. It also washes up great in the dish washer. I highly recommend this spatula!
"I consider this spatula an acceptable one because it is well made with a soft handle that is wooden and so smooth. Compare to its price; the quality is high. I wish the handle were longer because I used to make omelets every morning and needed some spatula with a long handle and heat-resistant head. Since I am baking for my baby with this spatula, I prefer it to be plastic because it is lightweight and safe. The plastic head was my first concern because I had some plastic spatula before which after a few months, some spots of the plastic head were missed. So, I was worry that I gave some plastic to my little one. I got this spatula, and I wash it with the dishwasher, but nothing happened to it. Not the handle nor the plastic head are damaged so far. I preferred to have a longer handle, and that‚Äôs why I gave a three star to this product. I am going to use it for BBQ, and I am sure it will work for that also. Sometimes I wipe its head without washing, and it can be cleaned completely even with a tissue. To make a long story short: Pros: *sturdy handle Cons: *short handle *soft head"
I decided to upgrade my kitchen utensils after renovating the countertops and backsplash in my kitchen. I got the complete set and I‚Äôm very pleased with the design and usefulness of each utensil. I love the wood and silicon contrast. It‚Äôs very stylish and matches perfectly with my kitchen decor. They are easy to clean and so far they have resisted the heat pretty well. Definitely recommended!

"More angled spatula than mixing or serving spoon, this utensil has a silicone-over-metal construction so it's flexible near the edges but firm in the middle. That makes it perfect for flipping burgers, stirring a stir-fry, or even scrambling eggs. The wood handle means you have to hand-wash it, but it looks nice and has a convenient hole at the top for hanging on a small gauge hook."
"You can wok around the clock with this spatula. It is perfectly designed for moving things around in a wok. The silicone is just flexible enough to mold to the contours of the wok but still firm enough that I can use it to pick up as much as its size will allow it to hold, without it bending.  The wooden handle is smooth and, if I lay it across the rim of the wok it will not get very hot as a metal handle might. There is a hole at the top of the handle should you decide to hang it.  I‚Äôve been looking for something like this for a while. I have converted most of my spatulas (and that is a lot of spatulas) to silicone for the ease of cleaning and their flexibility/firmness combination as well as the ability to use them in non-stick pans. I haven‚Äôt seen this shape which is my preferred shape for the wok, in a wood/silicone combination like this before and I‚Äôm glad that I picked this up.  Of course, it is also excellent for western-style pans as well, but this will be my go-to spatula when I wok.  Recommended.  Review of: KUFUNG Silicone Spatula Turner, Wooden Handle"
"This ""spatula turner"" is a beautiful tool with plenty of uses in the kitchen. Here are some highlights: - the head is a nice size, abundant for the jobs where such is needed (turning a pancake), but useful for all sorts of folding, stirring, and mixing-in-the-skillet tasks - I like the combination of wood handle and silicone head; of course it is utterly heat resistant, and the wood has a nice feel in the hand and dolls up the appearance - the downside is the tendency for accumulation of gunk in the joint between handle and head; this is an occasional cleaning task (not every time - it depends on use); but, at this price, it's a minor disappointment"
"TLDR: I like it.  We have an electric stovetop, so we had to purchase an inductive wok. It has a flat bottom to allow proper heat transfer from the electric heating elements, and it also has a non-stick coating. I was looking for a utensil that wouldn't scratch this curved-surface and allow me to cook asian meals.  The spatula surface itself is a little smaller than I expected, but it still works okay for my needs. The slightly curved front edge, along with the flexibility of the silicone allows it to easily scoop all food off the wok and not scratch it. I was worried about the wooden handle and the adhesive/connection to the silicone end, but it seems to holding up with no noticeable wear. I've put it in the dishwasher many times and still is doing just fine.  It works very well, and I like it!"
I like this modern spatula with the long wooden handle which is perfect to use on a frying pan without fear of scratching the bottom of the pan while flipping something. The only downfall is that it is hand wash only due to the wooden handle but I still really like it. There is also a hole at the top of the handle to hang.
"I like a good kitchen gadget and we all need decent basics, so I was happy to review this KUFUNG Turner/Spatula with wooden handle and thought I would try it out.  Spatula comes in a plastic bag (pictured with spoon from same line) with a label that is marked made in CHINA for those who want to know. The spatula is sturdy and not overly flexible. Head is wide enough for jobs like flipping burgers, moving items around a pan when sauteing, breaking up ground meat, etc. I do not agree that this would be a great spatula for flipping/turning anything much more delicate, like pancakes (the thickness of the spatula is nice but I prefer something thinner) or crepes (far too thick to turn something so thin). However this spatula will easily take on typcial jobs in the kitchen and look pretty nice doing it. At $4.16 at time of review it's a good value."
"This silicone spatula has a good, reinforced blade that is not flappy but strengthened inside. But it has a good, soft flexible edge to scrape, flip and stir food without damaging non-stick pans. The silicone blade is securely attached to a comfortable wood handle. Well made and very pleased."
"This spatula is just perfect for my non-stick pans. The shorter plane makes it easy to lift and flip the food. It can be washed in the dishwasher too. Although, I did get some kind of water spots on it, even though I put it on the top rack. It still works, but doesn't look as good. Recommended."
"This spatula looks awesome. It looks really sharp in my kitchen. The end is made of a flexible rubber, so it will not scratch up your pans. It is well made for omelets or pancakes. I like the wooden handle and it seems well-made and durable. I am pleased with this spatula."
"I got this spatula to replace a non-stick-safe spatula that had worn out after years of use. This one is not quite up to the same quality but it does well at many jobs.  The construction is a rubber blade and connection to a wooden handle. The listing tells me its bamboo but I can't tell if it really is. The spatula is certainly non-stick-safe and does well for pancakes though it struggles a little under the weight of a grilled cheese or a 10"" quesadilla. It isn't that strong at the connection. I also used it to press sausage patties flatter in teh skillet, something I could readily do with my old spatula that this spatula just doesn't do that well. There's too much give at the blade-to-handle connection point to pass to the patty."
"I've been using this spatula practically every day for over 2 weeks and my impression is WOW!!! I've made bacon & eggs, a variety of different foods, and a lot of stir fry and I can tell you that my spatula looks literally brand new! I handwash the spatula. It is sturdy enough to lift pieces of lasagna with ease. I have not noticed any burnt leading edge as some spatula's do when doing stir fry. Nothing seems to stick to the surface of the sptaula! Cleaning is a breeze! You can literally wipe it off with a paper towel! I do recommend a sponge with some soap though for hygiene reasons. It's a great price and belongs in every kitchen! I definitely recommend this. If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful icion."
I've been gradually upgrading our must often used utensils to silicone. I like that the edges are thin and soft enough to help scrap the food off of the edges of the pan but firm enough to help lift the food up for flipping or removing from the pan.
This turner has been holding up to frequent use and heat without issue. I have been hand washing it and cannot comment on how well the wood would hold up in the dishwasher. It has a nice feel in the hand and is perfect for cooking and baking cookies.
"got the whole set. They're well made. After using a few times, they hold up well in the heat and the plastic also cleans well. Sometimes I find it hard to get sauce stains and smells out of the plastic utensils but not with these. Definitely a great find!!!"
This is a BPA free silicone material spatula charter. This Turner is great to use for making sunny side up eggs and flipping them over for burgers on the stove top or anything needed To be stirred or mixed. I like how easy it is to use the spatula Turner. I like to hand wash it and let it air dry so the wood handle does not get damaged. I use this type of utensil on my pots and pans to prevent any damages or nicks or scratches. I also like how the silicone material loves me to scrape and get everything off the pants without leaving any residue behind. I would totally recommend the spatula turn in to any fruity or anyone who does a lot of cooking like myself because it is very useful and much better than using wooden material utensils.
"Thus far, this attractive little spatula is wonderful! The solid wood handle is pretty and sturdy, and the silicone spatula seems strong and heat resistant. I am assuming that there is some sort of metal reinforcement within the silicone to make it sturdy.  I prefer to hand wash this spatula, so as not to dry out the wood, which seems unsealed, but is nicely polished. It is dishwasher safe, but I know that it certainly wouldn't prolong its life to wwsh it that way."
"This is a nice wood or wood look and rubber spatula that will work great for non-stick pans, or aluminum.  I like the longer handle, and the wood gives it an attractive look for my kitchen.  The spatula part is thick and mine is black. The black and wood go together nicely.  I‚Äôm surprised at the price (at time of this review) to be less than $5, and I hope that doesn‚Äôt mean the quality is compromised but likely it is somewhat.  Overall, a nice spatula‚Äîif you had a set of these with the different spatulas, spoons, etc, it‚Äôd be a great look‚Äîat this price, nice gift for someone who is just starting out.  thanks for reading!"
"Love this Kufung Spatula turner. First off inexpensive at $5.31 but what's the use of cheap if it falls apart/flimsy right? Well this spatula turner, in my opinion, feels pretty sturdy and strong. The handle is wood and feels pretty comfortable to hold. The spatula itself is not flimsy and feels strong enough to scoop foods up. The spatula seems a tiny bit smaller than other spatulas but I'm still pretty happy with it. I just baked some crab cakes and the spatula was able to ""scoop"" the crab cakes no problem. The ""indentation"" / angle of the spatula makes it easier to scoop vs the other spatula I have that isn't as ""angled""."
"High marks for this attractive spatula with a light wood handle and black silicone flipping surface. I always prefer to use silicone to other materials (aside from wood) because I use high quality non-stick pans and expensive pots and I don't want any scratches. Silicone will not harm your pans. This one is particularly good because the flat flipping surface is not that large - only about 3 inches at its widest point - making it very useful for more delicate work, like flipping that one piece of potato that needs extra browning.  Plus: --Handle has a hole for hanging. --Dishwasher OK (suggest top shelf anyway)"
This looks so nice and works great as well. The silicone is incredibly nice and feels of good quality. It definitely feels well made. The old gives it a really beautiful look. Definitely a favorite in this house already.
"This has become my preferred spatula for flipping burgers, eggs or pancakes. It does not damage my non-stick pans and it is easy to get under things. I like the wooden handle because it feels good in my hand. It also has a hole in the end which allows me to hang it.  It is not the best spatula for things like removing cookies off the cookie sheet. It is not thin and stiff enough to get them off the sheet without damaging them when still warm.  I do wash it by hand because of the wooden handle. I think that dishwasher would age the wood quicker."
"The guesthouse kitchen had been a hodgepodge of plastic hand-me-downs from decades past. This year, we decided it was time for a modest upgrade. I ordered the whole set of these and they‚Äôre very nice looking. They fit comfortably in a small drawer too as their dimensions are complimentary. I think they‚Äôd also look nice on display if that‚Äôs your style (they have a hole on the handle for a hook). They were easy to wash although I will be avoiding the dishwasher to preserve the patina on the wood handle. They feel sturdy enough for casual use which is all we expect from guests anyway."
The spatula is easy to use and clean. it is heat resistant. It is really sturdy. It is great for cooking in non-stick pots. The rubber helps prevent your pots from getting scraped up.
"I really am enjoying the Kufung Spatula. I like how sturdy it is and how well it works for stir fry and beef dishes. It's quite strong and I like how the angle on this which makes it easy to turn food. I wouldn't use it for some dishes--like hash browns--as it's a tad smaller than most spatulas. I would not wash this in the dishwasher but I do find that if you're not careful, it collects ""gunk"" where the rubber meets the wood handle. That's a minor note for a pretty solid item and I got it mostly for the color and shape. It's a keeper, that's for sure!"
"This silicone spatula has just the right amount of bevel at the end, and flex to get under delicate foods like eggs or fish. Yet it feels sturdy and like it will last. The shape of the spatula end makes it easy to scoop up a larger portion of food - that makes it easy to use.  The handle is very comfortable to hold - no rough edges on the wood at all.  This feels like a quality tool to keep in the kitchen, and I think it will be my ""go-to"" for most things.  Size: almost 13"" long, the spatula end is 3.1"" wide at the widest part"
"This is an attractive spatula that will look nice in your jar for utensils on the counter. The handle is slightly slippery since it is a smooth/soft wood, but not that big of a deal. The base of the spatula is silicone, perfect for non-stick pans. However, the base is small. I tried to flip eggs with it this morning and they just slid off it and got crinkled in the pan. I prefer a wider base for eggs. But, the size is nice for things like a stir-fry or flipping smaller items in a pan. Sometimes you need a smaller base spatula and sometimes you need a bigger one. Nice to have options."
"This is my new favorite turner. I like the silicone. I have a carbonized steel fry pan that I‚Äôve had a few months. It has been ruining all my ‚Äúheat resistant‚Äù plastic turners. This Kufung silicone one is working great with it. It‚Äôs dishwasher safe and I have run it through the dishwasher a number of times with no problems. My husband says the silicone slides more than the plastic. As for me, it works the same. This is my second turner from this company. They are good quality. I would recommend this for your eggs too."
"I fell in love with the simplicity of this line of kitchen utensils. The wood handle and the simple designs of the dark spoon and spatulas has a wonderful classiness and I was lucky enough to get a good selection of ladels, spatulas, spoons and whisks. They look great together as a set and are gentle on my pans while functional. Time will tell how well they wear, but for not I am super happy with both their looks and functionalities. This mixing spoon has been especially good in combination with the wok and keeping the food moving. Love it!"
"I'm so happy to have a spatula turner again. After mine broke I'd been trying other tools to remove cookies from cookie sheets, and it didn't work well since I cook gluten-free (crumbly!). This comes to a good taper that helps dig under the cookies and remove them more smoothly. The shape works very well, and the silicone edge gives, but is firm enough to dig under and lift them up.  The wood of the handle has gotten a bit rough going through the dishwasher, but this is a minor issue for me since I like the ease of cleaning."
"I love this spatula. I really like the wooden handle, and of course silicone is the way to go for keeping your cookware nice and new, without any damage. It is very heat resistant, and extremely well thought out in terms of ergonomic design. I know that sounds funny to say for a spatula, but I do a lot of cooking, and this one really feels nice in the hand, and makes flipping, and mixing very user friendly. It's an excellent spatula, and would certainly get it again if for some reason I had lost it. I do recommend it!"
"This small silicone spatula is perfect and just what I was looking for. Great for pancakes and eggs. It is made from food grade silicone and a solid wood handle. The silicone is heat resistant up to *600, easy to clean and feels good in your hand. The wood handle has a hole for hanging too. I love silicone kitchen utensils because I have nice non stick cookware that I don't want scratched up from metal. With a price of less then $6 at the time of this review makes it all the more wonderful. Highly recommend."
"Typically when I'm shopping around for kitchenware here I expect to be pretty disappointed. Either the item is super cheaply-made and falls apart, or it's way smaller than expected and largely useless. That said, I'm incredibly satisfied with this spatula set! Each item is a single-piece design with no gaps, which means that there's no crevices for bacteria to fester and all sorts of other things that make me uneasy lol. On top of that, this also means that there's no need to disassemble/assemble as part of cleaning or storage. My previous spatulas all had removable heads, which at first seems pretty cool, but then over time I realized that cleaning them is a pain, drying them properly is even worse, they are full of gaps for crud to accumulate and trigger my inner germaphobe, and on top of all THIS, some of them have worn over time and have actually come loose while I'm cooking with them, which is certainly NOT a desirable outcome! So yeah, being a single-piece design is a HUGE deal for me, and these spatulas accomplish that perfectly!  Another feature that I'm very pleased with is the design of the spatulas. I grew up with the type of spatulas that red and orange models in this set are, but I had no idea what I was missing until I'd used the others. The purple and teal spatulas are sort of concave, and curve inward, so they have this flexible lip around them which is great for scooping sauces and liquids and stuff, and the little blue spatula is a fancy knife/spreader that is actually really handy for spreading sauces or whatever evenly.  I haven't owned these for too long, so I can't give a long-ranging opinion on durability, but so far I've used them a ton and they're holding up without any trouble, and they haven't melted or weakened under normal use. I would say that for the price, it's absolutely worth at least giving them a try!"
"Love the bright red color. Good quality, flexible and easy to wash. I had bought the other set @walmart and worked pretty good until I realized mold was growing inside the spatula!! I was so grossed out ü§Æ I immediately got them out of my kitchen. (See pictures) This new set seems to be made of a strong silicone, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I would not recommend anyone to buy these. They are cheaply made, and upon the first use I noticed metal popping from the silicone. I immediately called Amazon and requested a full refund. The ones at the Dollar Store are better quality and hold up longer if you're looking for an inexpensive spatula."
"For a particular task, a spatula may be the wrong size or shape. This set solves the problem, and they're easy to clean.  Washing silicone rubber with dish detergent may leave an oily film. With a squirt of cleaner containing borax or washing soda (maybe a tablespoon per quart of water), silicone will rinse squeaky clean, and I can put a spatula right back on its hook.  They clean food out of pans, jars, and cans, for less waste and an easier cleanup. I get extra servings of peanut butter, and the jar is easier to wash if I want to reuse it.  Cream of mushroom soup will boil over quickly. One day I used a spatula instead of a metal spoon to stir it on medium heat. Something came up. Expecting to be right back, I left the spatula in the pan.  It may have been half an hour later when I remembered the soup. It hadn't boiled over. Somehow, the spatula was causing the bubbles to collapse. What's more, the handle didn't feel hot."
I was looking for silicone spatulas to use for cooking on my non-stick pans. These are more like you would use for spreading condiments or frostings. The two larger ones are barely larger than my flat ware. They also get a haze in the dishwasher that is difficult to remove because they are textured.
"Not sure how much one can write about a spatula that would help anyone decide if this is a good choice. They work as expected - :) The different sizes are handier than I would have expected and the colors oddly enough are helpful when I'm looking through the drawer hunting ""that"" one. The quality is good although I've only been using them for a short time they show no signs of wear or fatigue. They clean up well even hand washing and don't appear to be affected by the high-temp dishwasher cycle. overall - quite pleased with the purchase."
"Love these. I'm replacing my W&S spatulas that have wooden handles and can't be placed into the dishwasher. These are completely silicone so they can easily go in to the dishwasher without having to separate the handle. I was particularly excited to add the jar spatula to my inventory and finally got to use it today to squeegee out the last bit of nutella from the bottom and sides of the jar. It worked perfectly and is one of those things that i didn't know i needed until i got one. Also, i like the vibrant and mixed colors, again to replace my clear W&S ones which have gotten dingy in appearance. Each spatula is specialized for different functions. I probably use the spoonula the most for cooking but the smaller ones are good for mixing sourdough starter, which i do regularly so it's good to have a couple of spatulas on hand. And, great price. Very happy with this purchase."
So far I like them. Will edit my review if something changes. I like them because they are one piece and the price was pretty good for five. I have a couple where the ends actually come off and they mold underneath and you have to use a toothpick to clean them. (Those did not come from Amazon). Will be throwing them out now that I have replaced them. Some of these are longer and that is nice for jars.
"These silicone utensils were just what I needed in the kitchen. So far they have held up to heat and regular use. I have only hand washed them so I do not know how they would stand up to regularly running them through the dishwasher. As for heat, I've used them stir, scrape and dish out hot food from hot pans. I do not leave them in the pan or lay them on hot pans. I am happy with my purchase, especially for the daily deal price I paid and love the bright colors. No issues with wires breaking through either. I would recommend to others."
"I wondered to self: ‚Äòdo i really need any more silicone kitchen equipment?‚Äô. But was drawn to these by their colour/varying functionality and price. Glad I did. I use them daily. Different sizes. Different shapes for different purposes. Just last night I realised I could actually use one for a spoon to serve. It was deep enough. And wouldn‚Äôt, of course, scratch the non stick container. The smaller ones are good in the air fryer. Wish they did tongs also.... Am tempted to buy a few sets as gift for friends. Bet they‚Äôve got some odd ones lying around, as I had, they are now donated. I certainly intend ordering another set for us for the cabin! Simply don‚Äôt want to be without. They became old friends within a week!"
"I had been looking for a new heat resistant spatula (I'm a little picky about my kitchen items) and saw this set. I decided to give it a try. I love them so much I ordered a set for my daughter! She loves them too! There is a spatula for every job and the smaller ones are great for getting the last bit out of a can. They also sturdy and hold up to heat even when my husband uses them! I would have liked all one color but I discovered that I like the different ones. They are bright, don't stain and clean up is easy!"
"These work very well for my purpose, mostly preparing baked goods for personal use. I especially like the straight spatula, which I use like a knife for cutting singly layer cakes. Not as sturdy or thin as a metal knife, but does not cause damage to aluminum pan surfaces. Nothing sticks to any of these spatulas so they are a breeze to keep clean, and they dry almost instantly with no spotting after rinsing in hot water. I'm well pleased with my purchase."
"The Hotec silicone spatula set arrived on time and in good repair. Even before I opened the package I could feel the weightiness of the content. I was very pleased with each spatula, particularly with how the ones used for mixing and stirring has a spoon like quality to them. Their size are substantial and they are good and hefty. Unlike some reviewers, I enjoy using the cake spatula the most and not for just icing cakes since I am not a baker. Overall this spatula set has been and excellent buy."
"I bought this for the small spatula in the set and thought if the others were any good then it would be a bonus. The small spatula was just the size I needed and my wife immediately started using the bigger spatula and ""spoon"" spatula and then threw out two of our old ones. They feel very sturdy and have nice stiff, but flexible ends on them and the red color is a nice muted red. we were pleasantly surprised."
"I recently received some Gotham Steel cookware and did not want to damage the cooking surfaces, so I purchased these and they are great. I can spread butter and mayo on bread for toast or sandwiches, can scramble eggs, and stir in my pots with no fear.  P.S. tThe price was great."
I began to cook with rubber spatulas rather than regular cooking utensils and ran into these after I accidentally melted a non-heat resident spatula of mine while making scrambled eggs. These are super great ‚Äîseemingly high quality at an affordable price. Packaging was a little challenging ‚Äî they were packaged separately and kept clinging to the plastic as I was taking them out. Will likely buy another set to have as spare because I‚Äôve been using them for EVERYTHING!
I have bought several spatulas and this is the best set I have found. Great at scraping bowls while baking and even spreading cakes. Food doesn‚Äôt stick to them and you can simply rinse them off but they are dishwasher safe and a great price for a set that will fulfill all your needs.
"Unlike the ones with the wooden handles that seem to slip off when I‚Äôm mixing after some age and use, these are one piece! I go through several a day so having a bunch is a must! They stir scrambled eggs, fry my onions for my chili, scrape the pots, mix my nuts into cookies‚Ä¶..the list goes on and on! Just suck it up and buy them! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
"These are the silicon spatulas I've been looking for. I was tired of all the others that have handles that separate from the blades because all kinds of gook and mold gets in between the handle and the blade. But with these spatulas, the silicon encapsulates both handle and blade so no where for the gook to go! Another plus is the extra long handle on 2 of them and a thin version for narrow openings. Highly recommend."
"These spatulas replaced my older set of wooden handled and plastic handled spatulas with rubber ""spoons"" on the end which would come off and/or melt in high heat. There are 5 sizes and shapes. Besides being very lightweight and sturdy, they are super easy to clean--simply place them on the top rack of the dishwasher."
"I love everything about this set of spatulas because they are one solid piece and not a handle with a spatula head on it because I find that food and water gets inside of the spatula head and you have to remove it to clean it or else it can mold, yuck. These spatulas are also not too stiff or limber so they can handle wiping stiff mashed potatoes out of a pan but not too limber too really swipe the pan clean. The set has the perfect size and assortment of utensils and you can‚Äôt get these in a store for this price!"
"I absolutely love these. I practically use them for everything now from cooking with to baking and icing a cake. When you use them to scrape a bowl, can, jar or pan they do a very good job ""scraping"". They do well with heat and are very easy to clean. Thank you!"
"I have been looking for a versatile set of spatulas that are also heat resistant. I ordered these and am very happy with them. I have had others that are heat resistant, but they seem to be a little heavy and awkward to use. These are perfect. There is a great variety of sizes and uses for them. I use at least one of then every day and love them. I ended up buying a set for my daughter too!"
I thought that silicone would be flimsy and could melt easily. Read up on silicone utensils and found that they are far more heat resistant and easily cleaned. So I ordered these to see for myself. They are great. Seeing is believing. We are very pleased with them.
"I really wanted that blue spurtle thing. I've been watching the infomercials on tv and thought I'd try something like this that can go through the dishwasher without worrying about wood cracking from use. I cook a lot. The spurtle thing is fine. I might buy a set with a bigger spurtle thing. The other utensils are really handy and getting plenty of use though I already had a ton of those things for cooking. For the price, this is a YES."
I LOVE these spatulas and scrappers. I use them for cooking everything. The spatulas have a little bit of a scoop that works great for spooning sauces and they don‚Äôt melt (I‚Äôve left them in sauce pans while cooking but not in fry pans with hot grease.) I highly recommend. I purchased multiple sets to have multiple colors and because I knew I would use them so much.
"We have had these for a couple months now. We use them almost every day. Having the different sizes is nice for certain things, but honestly, I find myself reaching for the larger ones most of the time. They don't scratch pans and you don't have to worry about the handles melting. You can scrape the bottom of bowls and pans clean throw them in a dishwasher. Great buy."
These are easily worth more than the purchase price. Easy to clean since they are completely covered in silicone. No little spots for old food bits to get down between the wood/metal and silicone business end of other brands I‚Äôve used. This is a easy recommendation!
"These are sturdier than the $1 store and $2 ones at Walmart, better made and have lasted 6 months so far without cracking."
"These Spatula's ARE EXCELLENT Spatula's to use in any cooking, serving, etc., They are sturdy and easy to clean. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to Any/All whenever a Spatula is needed in any process."
"I love these spatulas because of the variety. I especially love the long, narrow one for getting the remaining salad dressing or peanut butter from the container. No more waste."
"I ordered the multi-color set as I had read reviews about the white spots on the black and red, and thought maybe the multi-color wouldn't get them as bad. I don't find them a problem at all so far. There a few faint ones but it's not an issue. They are a little flimmsy at the tip as I also read, but not a big deal either. Very happy so far."
"If you've ever considered getting spatulas like this grab this set. We are constantly cooking here, for family and testing cookbook recipes for authors and this set is a steal. Super useful and easy clean up."
I love these They say they‚Äôre dishwasher safe but I won‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher again. It left a film over the spoon
"I should have purchased these much sooner. Better than old style with a wood handle. It won‚Äôt come off, and it won‚Äôt get mold. Easy cleaning. I like the bonus mini spatula. Perfect for Mayo or any spread to make a sandwich."
Variety of sizes and useful for hot or cold foods. I like that they are entirely made of silicon. I have another set with bamboo handles and the handles split. This set seems much sturdiers. I would buy again.
Different sizes for different applications. Very sturdy and firm on the interior yet flexible and supple on the exterior. One of the best purchases I‚Äôve made in the past year without question.
I just bought these for the skinnier ones so that I can get the last little bit of the mayonnaise. They do they job and are easy to clean up.
I got tired of having my silicone spatula head come off the handle. Problem solved with these one piece silicone spatula set. One piece construction.... what a great idea.
I had a similar set that had removable tops. Food always got stuck in the crease of the top. These are all one piece and no creases. Very easy to clean - no places for food to hide. I would buy again.
"Some have a lip around the perimeter making it efficient in getting hard to reach mayo, mustard and other things. Initially felt they were too small but after using them I adore them and bought a set for my daughter who loves them too."
Sturdy. All one piece each. Not coming apart when you wash them. They get the job done and the different sizes are a huge plus. Would recommend.
I normally don't care for silicone anything but I really like these with my nonstick cookware. The long one is ideal for getting the last if the mayo out of the jar.
"I first saw this at my SIL's house and fell in love with these spatulas! I always thought the small skinny ones never served a purpose but I used that one too! I love that it's all silicone so there's no parts to remove when washing to avoid mold. Super easy to clean, flexible tops but sturdy handles, love the color! So glad I bought these!"
These are good sturdy spatulas. Pretty too. I love the ones with corner feature for getting all my egg cooked in the pan. It lets me scramble like a pro.
"They seem very well-made, are extremely easy to clean and have just the right amount of firmness/flexibility. Now we‚Äôll have to see how long they hold up."
"No matter what I use these spatulas on, it washes right off when I want it to. I would buy these again, very good price."
You don‚Äôt know how much you need these until you get them. They‚Äôre small and can reach in small spaces and crevices. Super handy.
"nice color - as shown, solid handles and rigid enough in the handle but flexible at the spatula end. Nice compact size, not oversized, useful for my smaller cooking projects, for my camping/hotel hot plate travel plans too"
"Love the ""one piece"" spatulas, on my old ones the plastic handle would break off after a while but these are ""one piece"", they are sturdy, fun colors, easy to clean for a lot less money than what I paid for my old spatulas."
These spatulas have a comfortable feel when working with them. They are protecting my Fatbrware non stick skillets from scratches. Red color contrasts with most kitchen items; especially the red Kitchen-Aid stand mixer. I'm ordering another set as a small gift item.
Great spatulas for a variety of uses. Good quality and I did not notice a strange smell or taste as other people have complained about. The turquoise color is fantastic and looks awesome with my red kitchen.
"Perfect set for multiple applications. Spatula is sturdy and feels like high quality. It is not flimsy like some plastic spatula. So far good. Can't comment of longevity yet, but if breaks easy will definitely update the review"
"These are smaller than expected, but gets the work done. Middle firmness, not super soft. I reach for other soft spatula set to scrap out fluffy egg whites and to fold. These are great for thicker batters like cupcake."
Purchased these on a ‚Äúdeal of the day‚Äù so the price I paid for what I got was great. I‚Äôve used all of these now and they‚Äôre all sturdy and clean very easily. Would purchase as a housewarming gift as I think they will last.
They are just stiff enough to work perfectly. With the different sizes I use them for everything. Very easy to clean.
"I love these they are more sturdy than I thought the would be, I use mine for scrambled eggs and to mix batter etc, I also put in the dishwasher and they seem to be holding up good. I would recommend these, specially since you have different sizes."
"I liked the one piece construction and the bright colors. If you want to hang them, they have a suitable hole in the end of the handle. Great value!"
"I love this spatula set. It covers everything you might need a spatula for in the kitchen, of all shapes and sizes. Recommended!"
I love these spatulas. I bake a lot and these are perfect. I threw away my old ones. I have used them all. The thin one is great for emptying out jars and bottles of mustard or jam.. or frosting cakes!! I love them.
"I have used these for cleaning out containers, stirring sourdough starter, cooking and mixing all things."
Just received these this afternoon. Looks great and sturdy. Feels comfortable holding. Will update once we've tested them out.
These tools are real workhorses in the kitchen. Easy to use and clean up in the dishwasher or by hand. You will be surprised how handy they are.
My niece had these spatulas & I enjoyed the versatility with the various sizes! Also enjoy the punch of color they provide. Thoroughly enjoying these spatulas.
Don't know how I lived without these sturdy silicone spatulas. Prolongs the life of your non-stick fry pan surface.
"I'm really happy that I came across these. They are heat resistant and I love them. The sturdiness of them is great as well because now I don't have to worry about it possibly breaking. Overall, a good product and I'm happy that I came across them when I did. It is exactly what I was looking for."
I bought these to use with my countertop appliances they're much sturdier than others I've had. Price was great too.
Product came in just like the images shown. They are heat resistant and work well on syrups and nut butters! No signs of ripping off either. These are great spatulas and the variety of shapes and sizes is great!
"Good quality and work great. They aren't silky smooth, they have a nice non-slip texture making them easy to hold onto. Nice rich color that is consistent throughout, I'm not expecting them to fade. Haven't had any problems in the dishwasher. I would purchase them again and recommend."
love these. the variety of shapes is quite handy. they fit comfortably in my hand and clean up easily.
"I was surprised. It's a basic item that sold for just a couple dollars. I expected it might literally be disposable - work a few times and then I'd have to throw it away. Not claiming this is top anything, but it's much better than I expected it to be.  I'm sure I've used them at least twice a week in the last couple months for baking projects without issues."
"These are reasonable quality for the price and helpful to have on hand. For some reason the narrow scrapers are hard to find. Further, the rubber on the traditional Rubbermaid scrapers becomes hard and consequently unusable. The business end is soft silicone and hopefully will last and not deteriorate with time."
"Replaced my original pair of these spatulas after a decade of use. They may not have a trendy design, but they do as they're asked and their rigid hard plastic handles are slim and smooth - they don't interfere with with the other cooking utensils in my stove-top caddy - making their removal and return a one-handed operation."
"I needed to replace an old set of spatulas that I have had for decades . Some of the other spatulas on the market were just too flimsy, but these are perfect. I actually ordered 2 sets, one for baking and one for meat (think tacos) and they are great at both tasks."
"I cook heavy stews and soups etc. and I want every bit. These are ,thick, sturdy yet pliable. The handles seem strong. I tested them with scrambled eggs and they were good in the hot pan. They are a beautiful true RED and a perfect match in my kitchen. Great for the price."
"Very nice spatulas, especially fond of the smaller one as it is a handy size for cleaning out cans and bottles. Good price and seem pretty sturdy so far."
"These silicone spatulas are firm but still pliable enough to scrape out any type of can, jar or plastic container. They are heat resistant, easy to use and clean, and make old rubber spatulas obsolete. With proper care, they should last a long time. The purchase price is good, also."
I bought these spatulas merely for the narrow one to clean out jars. They are great quality spatulas. Not only am I using the narrow one for my jars I am also using the wider one in mixing. For the price you won't find better.
The product is as advertised. Color is accurate. Durability is great and easy to clean by hand or in dishwasher.
This product is what was described. It holds up well to heat and dishwasher.
"The price is good, I like the color, and it does exactly what I need."
These are nice and sturdy. I love the two different sizes.
"Works well and easy to clean. You could probably find similar in the dollar store, but these will probably hold up longer"
Like the handles they're easy to hold for small hands.
"If you're looking for a couple of regular / small sized spatulas don't look any further, this is a great product. 100% satisfied with it."
use them every day
Love these. They are well made.
Needed to get into baby jars. The little one did perfectly. The bigger one I use for everything else you would need one for. Great product..not cheaply made. Easy clean.
"LOVE the spoon one, the blade not so much, too flimsy."
Ordering more!
The small ones are so hard to find. I had to buy the set but I'll find a use for it. The price was great.
I love my new spatulas. They work the way they're supposed to and they are wonderful to use. I have arthritis in my hands and I am able to use these spatulas with ease. I would recommend these to anyone
Easy to use work great not to stiff I would recommend them
These are heat resistant! Easy to clean. Flexible. great to use.
Great for my candy apples!
"These are great spatulas. Very heat-resistant and easy to clean, great product!"
replacement for misplaced similar ittems
"After finally tiring of struggling with two very well used spatulas, we finally purchased Good Cook Classic Set of 2 Silicone Spatulas and they perform flawlessly. The blades disconnect for ease of cleaning and the red color is appealing."
Just as soft and flexible vs stiff for heavy batters etc
"No problems at all. My only complaint is that which I have for all this type of spatula, which it that the 'blade' part can be pulled off the handle ie it's not attached, and water and other things can get in there. Requires diligence in cleaning every once in a while."
I bought another and will keep for myself as I am really pleased with product and price
Just perfect and I love the red color too.
"Makes baking easy, mess-free. These are of really good quality and are inexpensive."
I looked long and hard to find this pair that matched what I grew up with in our home. The silicone heads are just the right stiffness and the clear plastic handles make the easy to use. Highly recommend.
Better than the dollar store ones.
"Nice, and feels like a good quality. Does a really good job and easy to clean,"
"The smaller spatula is fine, so far. The larger spatula has been a problem from the start; the spatula head slips off which can be frustrating."
These are nice for the price and haven't melted. At least the red part is heat resistant the clear handle is not. I left it in the oven by accident and half of it started to melt. But they still work nicely.
Excellent value
Great spatulas. Very flexible and easy to clean.
Good quality
Used these for soap making. Wanted to keep my soap instruments separate from my cooking stuff so got this set. Worked perfectly and price fit well with my budget.
"Mixing, cooking, good price."
Good strong
Like
My mom loves them. One of hers broke so I just ordered these and they arrived in a day.
"I have nothing bad to say about these spatulas. They do just what you want baking spatulas to do. They are firm, but flexible enough to easily scrape batter out of a bowl and they are easy to clean. Good purchase."
"Nice color, spatula seems secure and the color is nice. No complaints here. I've been surprised at how useful the small spatula is for cleaning out things like blenders."
A size for almost all occaions. Can use in hot foods on the stove without fear of melting to the smaller one for getting into and reaching the bottom of the jar.
I ordered these to use with making soaps and other cosmetics. They worked great for these tasks and cleaned up easily.
These are spatulas! lol. They work and do their job.
Easy to clean and use
Do what they're supposed to.
"Accurate description, happy with purchase."
"Perfect size, just what I needed."
Very nice set and good sizes for different size containers.
These are to replace some we had purchased years ago from a local market. They are just like the old ones and just what I wanted. Work fine and can be used on hot pans.
These spatulas are sturdy and not flimsy. They work perfect and the little one is great for cans. I use these for mixing instead of spoons.
"Sturdy, colorful and flexible--am satisfied with purchase and easy to spot in the storage container"
"These are really nice spatulas,great price fast ship, holds up to hot wash in dishwasher. great price."
My wife loves these spatulas almost as good as the old Rubbermaid ones from the 70's and 80's.
She loves them. They are well made and handle the dishwasher with no problems. Would recommend to anyone. Great product.
I love these and use them everyday
Loves these spatula .. I use them for frosting cakes spreading cool whip great kitchen tool also.
"Really good product, flexible enough to clean bowls thoroughly"
"They work well, soft enough, but not too soft. Comes apart for cleaning."
These are the most useful spatulas I have. The other flimsy one I will be giving away.
I use these all the time and are very sturdy. The heads come off for easy cleaning but stay on when you need them too. At just over $5 these are a great purchase. Would buy again.
These arrived as promised. They work well and go through the dishwasher well.
"Nice sturdy spatulas, do the job nicely, will most likely order a second pair. Strong enough to scrape the gooyest recipe"
"This item is exactly as expected. The size and thickness is about what I thought it would be. The edges of silicone are a little sloppy on the sides and top where it meets the handle, but it doesn't hinder the use. The bendable tip has a clean edge so that's what matters.  I definitely can't wash this is the dishwasher. In Arizona the water is so hard that it leaves permanent water marks and odor on plastic or silicone. I made that mistake on other full silicone utensils I bought on Amazon so I don't want to risk my more expensive OXO cooking utensils.  This spatula/turner is my new go-to cooking tool for making eggs. It works really well for fried and over medium eggs. I have an almost identical rayon spatula I've used for years and this silicone one works much better."
"Everyone equates quality and innovative design functionality with OXO products and for good reason. This silicone spatula is no different. I purchased this one because I was so tired of the nylon plastic spatulas. The edges melt if you use them in a pan that's too hot and then you can't flip an egg and you're wondering how much of that is now in your food.  The great thing about silicone is that it can handle the heat. You know the old saying, if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen! This baby belongs in the kitchen and the more you use it, the more you'll appreciate it's simplistic design and functionality. The silicone can be dropped into boiling oil and never flinch.  It's flexible, which is great when trying to get under something you're cooking. Plus, the edge is tapered, so it's easy to get under a fried egg or a pancake, but is reinforced with a piece of steel inside the silicone, so it can also dish it out. Literally. I know it won't last forever, but it's sure making a run for it. This spatula is the first one I reach for when I'm cooking and has easily outlasted all the other's I've purchased for cooking in my non-stick pans. If it ever wears out, I'm running to Amazon and ordering another one. It's that good.  ***UPDATE***  Well, it's been 1 year since I purchased this turner and it finally broke. Almost a year of daily use, so that's not bad. I'll definitely be buying a new one. Not sure how they could resolve the issue, but it's exactly the same problem I had with my original purchase. There is a piece of metal (it's actually the entire turner) which is covered in silicone. This keeps it from damaging your non-stick cookwear and the silicone gives it the heat protection. However, there is an additional edge, along three sides, where it's just tapered silicone. The metal underneath the silicone eventually breaks through the silicone and starts to come through. I took a couple of photos to show, but can't find a way to attach them to my review. If you know of a way, let me know!"
"I searched through amazon for hours looking at the spatula line up, and ended up buying some others with thousands of 5 star reviews. They were garbage. Eventually I found this one, and let me tell you, its the best one on the market by such a huge margin, its not even close. I ended up buying another small size one, and the large size one too, since I use these every single day, sometimes a few times a day. This thing is built solid, and is study enough to flip heavy steaks, and smooth enough to flip omelets. I cook a lot of food on my Lodge cast iron skillet and this spatula holds up, not a single sign of wear, damage, or melting from heat. I've even used this spatula to scrape out burnt on stuff from the skillet while its still on the stove, and it was fine. Every other non-metal spatula I have is melting, peeling, or chipping a little bit at the tip, but not this one. It can handle high heat without a problem, and can handle high heat in the dishwasher without warping. I strongly recommend you buy this spatula, its the best one out there by far."
"Excellent spatula. Most importantly, both handle and business end are silicone, which is great if you are like me, and tend to leave it on really hot surfaces from time to time.  I would also note that it is larger than I had imagined, which for me makes it great for larger pans/dishes, but a little bit tricky for making a bunch of sunny side up eggs in one medium sized frying pan. Check out the picture, I provided beer for scale üòÑ  Overall I highly recommend it."
"Bought mine in January 2017 and the silicone has finally ripped around the corner of the metal insert. This is an excellent flipper, but a scrapper it is not. Treat it as it was designed and I assume it will last longer than 1 year. Go buy a wooden spoon to scrape and use this to flip.  I use this on my Le Creuset skillet, which you cannot use metal on. The silicone outer shell combine with the strength of metal in this product did the trick. I'm buying another one right now, but don't use this to scrape your pan and this should last."
I used this turner with care and liked it a lot. But the silicone part chipped off after only 11 months of use. I didn‚Äôt expect to replace a $10+ turner once a year. The lack of durability is disappointing.
"I bought this is September 2015 and just threw it out in June 2020, only because the silicone on one corner tore and the metal was exposed. I didn't want my non-stick pan to get scratched up. The tear did not affect the usability of the the spatula otherwise.  This is essentially a thin metal spatula covered with a thin layer of silicone. This construction makes it extremely thin, yet sturdy, and highly heat resistant, unlike all silicone spatulas or plastic spatulas. Like all OXO products, this is very well made and super functional.  Since the day it arrived, I have used it every single day for either chapatis (type of flat bread, like a tortilla), parathas (stuffed flat bread), omelettes, pancakes, etc. Anything you need to flip, this works. This thing is a monstrosity, size wise. The extremely thin edges combined with the large size makes it perfect for flipping large but delicate items such as pancakes, omelettes and frittatas, without destroying the dish. I also have a smaller version (or rather normal sized) of this for smaller pans where this doesn't fit.  It lasted almost 5 years. I would 100% recommend."
"Was looking for a spatula that could both flip pancakes and scramble eggs. I love this spatula and am tempted to buy another. The surface area isn't really large (like the stiff, larger spatula I have that is specifically for pancakes), but it's perfectly adequate for 95% of my cooking tasks in nonstick pans (which is 95% of my cooking, tbh). And I like it so much that I use it for pancakes over my other spatula, anyway.  The tip and edges are flexible enough to slide along the curved surface of skillets, scraping up all the bits of egg or whatever. But it's also sufficiently stiff that it is still effective on more stubbornly adhesive foods, too. The very tip is cut at an angle so it can easily slide under foods. It's a breeze to clean up and hasn't warped or melted against the edge of the pan when I accidentally rest it there for several seconds. Would definitely buy again."
"I accidentally melted a 50 year old nylon spatula. I bought a new turner from Amazon that says it is nylon but it has a rough surface that is hard to clean and the edge of it is already frazzling away, with exactly the same use as the old one.  I had avoided Silicone spatulas because I needed a stiffer one, and one with an edge that could get under stuff, yet I have a nonstick pan.  I bought this one and it is great. it is very smooth and easy to clean. It doesn't scrape the hardening drippings while cooking quite as well as my late, lamented nylon one, but if I turn it to one side (but not the other) it scrapes well enough. (I still have the slotted spoon from the ancient set, so I can compare the two directly.) it gets under the onions that need to be turned better than the Amazon-purchased nylon one does, but not quite as well as the ancient one. It is a good size and is well-balanced."
"We cook a lot, and when our last batch of spatulas finally gave up the ghost it was time to look around for new ones. We cook so much that our utensils become kind of like old friends, and once we discovered we had to pick a new brand (our old one was discontinued) the search took us through 3 different styles and makes. This one by far is the best- its got a great sized head so it can be used for eggs, potatoes, pancakes, you name it. It‚Äôs very sturdy. The handle is very comfortable. It‚Äôs easy to clean and it holds up to high heat. What more could you ask. We will be buying a few more."
"Beware, the handle is made of plastic, not silicone. It melts immediately on contact with a hot rim."
"I should have taken a closer look at the dimensions of this spatula before ordering. I thought I was getting a typical average sized silicone spatula, but this one actually has a HUGE paddle. It‚Äôs fantastic for flipping over a whole omelet or crepe without breaking it; the only problem is when you have to use it on something smaller without disturbing everything in the pan - then it‚Äôs tricky to maneuver. And it barely fits in my small drawer. But otherwise we make it work and now have lots of perfect omelettes so I‚Äôm not rushing to buy another one."
"I have generally had great experiences with OXO products, but this turner is an exception. After less than a week of use, the silicone outer coating has split, revealing the metal underneath. Now there is a tear and hole that will trap water and food and grow bacteria. I am very disappointed. Also, this product is not available for a refund, according to Amazon, so I would have done just as well to throw away $10."
"This is an amazing addition to our kitchen! I love the OXO brand to begin with and this product didn't let me down either. The silicone is on the spatula and the handle (making it easy to grip AND clean). I've found (by accident) that the silicone on the spatula part is fairly heat resistant: My boyfriend accidentally left it in a searing hot pan after cooking, and it didn't even change shape or melt away... but that doesn't mean I would recommend doing that! The only hard part was removing the sticker from the metal in-between the spatula and handle when it first arrived. Other than that I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I have replaced all our plastic spatulas with these (different sizes) and haven't regretted the decision once."
Have had the ‚ÄúSmall Silicone Flexible Turner‚Äù for 10 years and the silicone finally gave way. Came back to purchase a replacement and decided to give the ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù Turner a go. Love the size - it is a nice set having both the Small and Large for various fry pan cooking activities. The spatula itself has a thin metal inner covered with silicone so it does not scratch your non-stick pans but offers great function - holds it shape when you are flipping things. Great product - the fact that I searched to purchase the same one again after 10 years speaks for itself!
"When I first pulled this turner/spatula out of the box I had 2 thoughts: it's very heavy and it's way too thick. I didn't think there was any way that it would work very well, but I've been pleasantly surprised. Despite it's heft and seeming thickness, it works very well, easily slipping under foods (I've used it for frying eggs, scrambling eggs, making hashbrowns, and browning hamburger, to name a few). I'm hopeful it will last a while, too, unless other plastic-silicon turners that eventually get hard a brittle. Definitely recommended!"
"I purchased this Turner, or what I refer to as a Spatula, more than five years ago. I'm not one of those people who post a review after a couple of days and can only provide superficial first impressions. I want to use it for a while and find out how truly durable it is.  This spatula has given me great use over the last five-and-a-half years. I bought two of them and alternate using them, which means I don't have to keep washing a single one before using it again. It's comfortable to use. Plenty big enough to pick up a large pancake in a pan and still able to pick up smaller items though a little more effort is required.  I haven't tried to deliberately use this spatula on hot surfaces. I end up touching hot stuff accidentally enough. That being said, it seems very resistant to heat.  Of the two spatulas I bought, one looks unscathed. The other accidentally rested against something hot recently and it deformed the plastic and exposed the metal plate inside the spatula. Once that happened, water would collect inside the spatula when I put it in the dishwasher. Time to get rid of it. It took more than five years of almost everyday use for that damage to occur, which I consider amazing.  I like this Spatula (aka Turner) so much that I'm ordering another one and hope that it too has a long useful life."
"I purchased this spatula 4 years ago this month. It looks as new today as it did the day I received it. The quality of this line of products is impressive. The spatula hasn't faded, melted, become brittle, chipped, or had any other defects. My husband and I are so impressed, we have since switched all of our kitchen utensil needs to this brand.  It doesn't stick to any food items, and is easy to use as well as clean up. I don't have a dishwasher, so we hand wash everything. I can't say whether or not that has made a difference. I can say, we are OXO customers for life."
"This spatula was used for one year for daily breakfast ( eggs/meat) prep and other evening meals. All who used it really liked it. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end and so it is with my spatula. The right front corner silicone tip split and broke exposing the metal about 1/2"" : ( But I liked it so much, and it only cost $10. that I thought I would buy it again. I contacted OXO after searching for their contact info. OXO (not Amazon) stood behind their satisfaction guarantee and mailed me a new one! Great customer service, thank you OXO! Now I will just spend that saved money with them on another utensil : )"
"I've had many of these Oxo silicone spatulas, both the large and small ones. They work very well, super easy cleanup, and they'll last a good few years before the silicone eventually will split somewhere. I think my last small one (the one that sees the most use) went about 5-6 years before I had to replace it. Doesn't retain stains or smells. Highly recommended for a basic no-frills spatula that gets the job done.  The only thing it doesn't do well is break up ground meat when frying it up. For that I recommend, if frying in nonstick cookware, a good wooden spatula."
"I've been using this spatula for a little over 3 years, and it's still going strong. No broken parts, and it's very easy to clean. The only downside is that because of the thickness of the edge of the spatula, it can sometimes be difficult to slip it under the edge of items. My previous plastic spatula worked better in that respect, but then I realized I didn't want to use a material that could melt and get into my food."
"I‚Äôve bought a total of 3 of these, not because they quit working but because I wanted one everywhere I am! We have a lake house and I needed one for inside and it works awesome for the grill. I‚Äôve recommended this product and another size (that I will leave an identical review for) to everyone who talks about needing a spatula. They don‚Äôt melt or turn hard. They are flexible and sturdy at the same time. To say I love this is an understatement."
"My second purchase of this item did better than my first one...... because..... I didn't leave the second one laying in a hot pan when done. Letting it stay in the heat while the pan is cooling down I think is a bit much for this tool. On my stove I have a small center plate that holds spoons, forks, etc that are used for cooking. Put this OXO on that instead of leaving it in the pan and yours just may last like mine -- 2 years now and doing excellently! No deterioration anywhere. Be kind to it."
Nylon and plastic spatulas pit fine scratches on my nonstick pans. This spatula is a silicone encased metal spatula. The super soft and bendy silicone does not scratch. The metal inner spatula gives the whole thing strength. The spatula's thinness makes it relatively easy to slide it underneath delicate foods like fried eggs. Great spatula.
"Bought this to use on microwave crossing tray for crossing up/cooking meats and fried potatoes and the strange vegetables I've had to substitute for more favored ones during the Pandemic food shortages, this doesn't scratch, long enough to reach inside the microwave when its door is open and its ""off"" to flip over cooking foods, good grip, extra sturdy and easy to wash in hot soapy water then finger to air dry. Would recommend, just a bit overpriced in my opinion."
"I have had the larger version of this OXO spatula for my regular-sized pan, which has lasted over 2 years. I loved it so much that I had to get a smaller version of it for my personal-sized pan, which turns out to be the perfect size. Food does not really get stuck on it and I can flip my eggs/pancakes perfectly with this spatula. I believe the secret of having silicone spatulas that last is not to abuse it (Not leaving it in the pot/pan while food is cooking, no aggressive brushing). Definitely one of the best spatulas out there."
"I have no idea what a spatula is. I don't think anyone else does either. There are sort of a baffling number of kitchen implements colloquially referred to as a spatula, and they all have different functions and different shapes. When I was growing up, it was a device that followed this general purpose and form factor that I knew as a ""spatula,"" but these days seems most commonly labeled a ""turner."" People who do a lot of baking have a radically different idea of what a spatula is, and those tend to be more akin to a putty knife or a paint stick. And then there are the utensils with a soft rubber or silicone spade on the end that serve best to mix and scrape batter and dough. It seems that most of the time you need to refer to the types as a genus and species; spatula-scraper, spatula-turner, spatula-spreader. Or else inspire that moment of terror and confusion in your kitchen when a friend is helping you cook and you ask them to hand you a ""spatula"" and watch as they try to determine which implement you actually want.  That introduction aside, this is a great spatula (turner). The turner part is flexible, yet firm, and the silicone is slick enough to easily slide under anything you need to turn. It is also more ""non-stick"" than a standard plastic affair. It does a very good job pressing food into the griddle to get a good sear, and then lifts the morsel back off the pan to flip. The very wide base means you can pick up pretty sizable portions. It won't support as much weight as a more sturdy turner, but then again you probably have a more sturdy turner for applications like that. This works perfectly for what I usually make; things like fish, hash browns, fried eggs, burgers. Plus the handle is fat and rubber so it fits in the hand well and doesn't threaten to slip even if you have wet or greasy hands. Great purchase."
"I have no idea what the naysayers are complaining about. This product is positively splendid. I cook a lot of foods especially a 12 egg omelet over some olive oil. The previous spatulas used would bend and burn to a point of leaving plastic in the pan. This product does no such thing. It flips those very large omelet's with ease and clean up is a pleasure, no sticking eggs. Like I said previously, those naysayers must be flipping bricks or using the wrong tool for the job."
"Oxo makes very good products which I have used for years. I have used this spatula for years, but bought a second one because we needed on although still using the first.  This has gone through years of use, and dishwashing on occasion so it does last. Worst part is I have dented the silicon slightly if left on the stove directly and not realizing it, and the handle it not silicon so if you leave it on the pan with the handle on the pan side, this will melt through after some minutes. But being plastic, that is perfectly expected.  Otherwise, this is a first-class product. I ordered the regular size and this is just about applicable for every application. A necessary tooling the kitchen."
"At last, a spatula long enough to turn a stupid egg! My last one this large melted at the end...red plastic in your egg is not good. Oxo did not have the gumption to ‚Äòfess up and say what temperature this will handle. But Oxo has been good so far in other products, so I‚Äôll take a chance. It is flexible so don‚Äôt order if that bothers you. Just be aware that they did not say how hot. I‚Äôll be watching the edge for roughness. But I seldom fry eggs at 600 degrees, so we do have a fighting chance..."
"So far this is working great. I got it specifically to use with my electric griddle. Normally I use cast iron, so I am always using metal utensils. Now I needed something for a nonstick surface. After reading reviews and understanding that it's metal underneath the silicone, and it can be prone to breaking through the silicone, I am only using it for my electric griddle and treating it very gently. I'm hoping it will last. So far so good. It's a great size for pancakes. I'm glad I got the larger one and not the smaller one."
"I use this spatula every day on all my cooking projects. It is very flexible and can be used for a variety of functions (scooping diced veggies in a pan, stirring, serving, etc.). It is easy ‚Äî so easy! ‚Äî to clean and immediately ready to go back to work. The small size (there is a larger one) is the perfect one for my needs. It is indestructible (so far) and I expect will be an important part of my kitchen for years."
glad i finally woke up and quit buying those plastic spatulas. they melt so easily and are a pain to clean. These silicone spatulas are great as nothing sticks to them and cleaning is as easy as running water over them and wiping with a sponge. And so far NO melting so they truly are very melt resistant.
"We have tried many different turners and this is hands down our favorite! It easily gets under eggs - which are, in my opinion, one of the hardest things to flip - to turn them. I highly recommend this kitchen tool!"
"This is exactly what I've been looking to find for years. Why did I waste so much money buying nylon turners? I didn't believe it could be so thin at the edge from the pics, but it is. Sturdy, just the rignt amount of flexibility, and it doesn't melt on a hot pan like the nylon ones do. I have seen that some people have had them deteriorate, but I have another silicone utensil I've used for years without damage, so I have hight hopes for this one. I'm so mad that I wasted money buying nylon, when I could have had this silicone coated metal turner. The edge is even thinner than the nylon turners."
"I've had this for 3¬Ω years now and it's still going strong. I use it every morning for breakfast and 1‚Äì2 times a week for dinner as a general purpose cooking utensil. I had had problems with non-stick-compatible spatulas deforming, so was looking for something more reliable. This item hasn't failed me yet. As well as the heat resistance I was mainly after, this is flexible enough to maneuver underneath things, sturdy enough to hold them, and I've never had problems with food unduly sticking to its surface. Totally worth the investment.  It's bigger than most spatulas, as it promises. I find this to be really useful for the kinds of things I do with it (think fried/scrambled eggs and pancakes), so to me the large size is a bonus.  One thing to watch out for: the handle is not silicone and will melt on contact with a hot pan, so be careful not to leave it sitting like that. But you can leave the silicone spatula bit itself in contact with the pan and it'll be fine."
This seems very sturdy. The handle is a bit short but the spatula part is very long so it makes up for the shorter handle. Only put it in the dishwasher once so far but it seemed to hold up great. Good spatula and OXO products usually are quality if a bit pricey.
"This is the second of these turners that I've had. I loved the first one, but messed it up by banging one of the corners of the end on the bottom of my frying pan to get food off of it, so don't do that! I bought another one because I love it for just about everything. It's the only spatula I have that's fit for use with non-stick surfaces of all sorts, that doesn't stick to eggs and other foods. I was tired of being frustrated with turner/spatulas that stick to eggs and pancakes, etc, tearing them and breaking yolks I wanted to keep whole. This one is great that way. The only down side is that you have to move food to the plates carefully or it slides off, but I'll put up with that happily in order not to have a breakfast that plates up like a yellow-blooded trainwreck! Definitely recommend this product."
"I have only had my turner for a few weeks, but it's been used almost every day and so far it's as good as they said it would be. No more melted turners!! I paid almost this much for a ""heat resistant"" big name turner at a BIG retail outlet, it melted and bubbled and was unuseable from the first time it was used. Decided to try this one and boy what a difference. Great Turner. If it breaks, I'll replace it. I don't have a badly bubbled, melted turner after the first pancake. I've used it for fried eggs, turning pancakes, removing cookies off a hot cookie sheet and other tasks and it's performed beautifully. It takes a little getting used to, learning just the right angle to hold it so that the edge slips easily under the food, but I've quickly adjusted and love it. I'm ordering another one and one of the other turners in this series. I've washed it by hand (very easily done) and in the dishwasher with NO issues whatsoever. As another reviewer said tho, probably washing by hand causes less wear and tear on the turner. I would recommend this turner to anyone. It's well worth the price."
"I love this spatula!! It's sturdy enough to use with almost everything and can't damage my non-stick pan. Not good for use with a cast iron skillet though, go for metal there. After quite a few years the corners can eventually bend enough that the metal can poke through, which is why i've had to replace one. However, The last one I bought is still going strong and I just ordered this so I have an extra for when the other is dirty. I don't recommend the larger size cause it's easier to wear the corners and it's actually super awkward to use and the food slides right off cause it's bulkier."
As stated this is our 2nd time purchasing - this one for the family mountain house. It‚Äôs perfect for fried eggs in particular where you need something delicate but wide enough to flip without destroying the yolk. It‚Äôs also quite capable of picking up much heavier pieces such as chicken without damaging your pans. Cannot recommend enough. OXO has become my go-to as far as kitchen accessories go.
"I‚Äôve been slowly replacing my kitchen utensils with silicone products. Slightly flexible with beveled edges, makes it easier to slide this under whatever you are trying to pick up in a pan. Silicone won‚Äôt dry out like rubber will over time and can withstand much higher temperatures, so you won‚Äôt scorch the edges of these and they won‚Äôt start to crumble after years of use. Like rubber products, definitely a safer option to use on Teflon (or similar) coated pots and pans.  The official cookie baker at my Lions Club events, I already use silicone mats on my cookie sheets. This spatula was purchased specifically for cookie removal, finding that it works better than a rubber spatula, especially with the beveled edges. And the cookies slide off the spatula a little better. But since I have it, I use it to remove or flip anything smaller from a pan. I use the 5‚Äù wide Oxo Grips spatula for larger items like pancakes.  The grip is both comfortable and resistant to heat."
"Mine lasted about 3.5 years with almost daily use. Mostly over medium eggs in the mornings. The edge where the metal ends finally started to crack. While still usable, I worry the metal could scratch the pan if pushed and angled just right. I just purchased a replacement."
"It's an OXO 600-degree (F) silicone spatula, but because I'm single and generally cook small quantities of food, I don't find it as useful as most of the other OXO silicone spatulas. However, for those times that there is a need for a large spatula (holiday entertaining or cooking for ""potluck"" church dinners, etc.), this is the kitchen tool that will prove to be invaluable. For those who cook with non-stick surfaces, including seasoned Calphalon (TM), it's an absolutely no-mar device, and will tolerate any reasonable cooking temperatures without melting or deforming. I've gifted several of them now, and the consistent comment from the recipients is that it's become a go-to kitchen tool - it will spoil you."
"If you cook eggs very often and use a nylon spatula, you know that the eggs are practically plastered to the spatula making it almost impossible to get clean. These are wonderful and eggs do not stick to the spatula and of course they're safe for your non stick pan."
Love this - had purchased a small and a larger before. The larger was too flexible‚Ä¶accidentally ‚Äúspronged‚Äù food from my pan all over the stove when trying to stir and scrape the bottom. The smaller is short enough to be stiffer yet still easily slips under the food so purchased a second one smaller one
"I got the smaller one, which was kinda too small for eggs, but great for cookies, etc. Then I got this one, since there is no ""medium"" sized one and it is way too big to flip a few eggs in a small pan. Nonetheless, it is a great, well made spatula and I will use for for lots of other things! I could also use a larger egg pan, I suppose. Maybe I will try that."
"I love this thing. I am an avid omelet maker/consumer and this spatula is exactly what I was looking for in my morning routine. It flexes quite well near the edges so you can press it to the sides of a pan easily, but the center is firm enough that you can use it to flip quite a large omelet (mine weigh about 2 pounds). Cleaning is a breeze as well, only requires a couple seconds in the sink. The durability got 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to properly evaluate that. The versatility got 4 stars because it is quite large, so it perhaps would not be as good for frying say, 4 cups of spinach, I know, because I have used it for exactly this and it is just a bit large - unless you use the corner.  Overall, I love this spatula, and I am a bit of a spatula aficionado."
"This is my second OXO small, flexible turner. I have a huge kitchen drawer with all my utensils in it and I constantly grab this one. I bought a second one so I wouldn't have to dig for long to find one. The first one, which I've used constantly for two years, looks practically identical to my brand new one. These are well made, clean up easily, and are easy to use. These smaller ones are just right for smaller & larger frying pans. By smaller I mean standard size. The larger model is a bit too big if you are using a 8"" or 9"" pan. These are just right & you can still easily turn things in a larger pan. Great buy!"
"Another quality product from OXO, the size of this Turner/Spatula is perfect for turning larger size items such as fish or eggs. The silicone is very flexible and this has a very nice overall design, well engineered like the rest of the OXO products I own."
"Bought this 10 years ago. It‚Äôs been one of the most used utensils in our kitchen and I‚Äôm back to Amazon for a replacement. Sure, the handle got marred because we left that leaning on the side of a hot pan over the years, but the working part of this tool never gave up til the silicone covering finally wore out. Great turner - does its job well and holds up to the heat in the pan - unlike its nylon counterparts. we highly recommend!"
"Silicone is what I wanted, and it works like a dream. No melted edges. Nice weight and size for traditional flipping duties. Will scrape some fond off a pan with liquid but I'm trying not to scruff it up. Scrapes the sides of pots well, to get that last bit of goodness. Hole in the handle is nice to have but I put everything in a drawer except the big spider scoop. This spatula nests nicely with the larger one in storage."
"I've bought two of these for myself and countless as gifts. It always seems like a weird gift but the recipients generally end up buying at least one other size. Two things make these special. The silicone doesn't melt and it's thin enough to go comfortably under pancakes or eggs. It also has a metal core which makes it strong enough in case it's something a little heavy like a hamburger. The only downside is that if you leave it in the pan with the black plastic handle touching the side of the pan it will melt a groove in the handle.  It feels a little odd to be so in love with a turner, but I have about 15 silicone spatulas so obviously got an obsession with kitchen gadgets that work well and I'm too lazy to hand wash them between uses. I'd actually like to have a couple more of these but it's easier to get these safely clean than than wooden handled scrapers."
"I love this utensil, my last one started to break and expose the metal so I had to be careful not to scratch my pans and woks and got to the point where I couldn't live without it so I bought another one. I'm not sure how they could improve the durability since the point is to have as fine an edge possible for getting under whatever you are flipping, but I'm only taking one star away because it's not poorly constructed I just use it a lot more than flipping some over easy eggs once a week. I love to stir fry and wok every night. Last OXO I had lasted 3 years."
I love you friend and I‚Äôm very impressed with the nonstick function on it however it isn‚Äôt as sturdy as I‚Äôm used to from oxo. the tips why I make the omelette and put the omelette seem to be almost melting a little bit already which is very unusual for this brand . Still so much better than what I‚Äôve had in the past at least I am not scraping off the eggs wipes right off nothing sticks
"LOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEE these spatulas. Much better than the plastic ones we had before. The leading edge is flexible and slips right under fried (no grease) eggs and pancakes. It also helps to scrape out food when serving so less waste.  12/19/19- These are still working great and look like they did on day one. We cook a lot at home too. Note: On the same day I ordered these I bought a set of Di Oro Spatulas that had a pancake, fish turner, and standard spatula in it. The standard spatula looked exactly like these OXOs. They worked side by side day by day out of the same drawer. The Di Oro spatula's silcone cover came undone and broke off a week ago and now is in the trash."
"My turner started to break on the leading edge after 5 years of using once or twice a week. I reached out to Oxo, sent a picture, and a new one arrived in a few days! Great customer service. I have several Oxo items but this is the first problem."
"I've only used this once, but I can tell it is exactly what I wanted. The big problem I have had with ""no-stick"" spatulas is that they do not seem to slide under eggs, (for instance), rather, they seem to want to ""push"" the food regardless of how well I have lubed them with cooking oil, no-stick spray, or anything else. Of course I don't yet know how this will hold-up over time, but I can always return and report any disappointment."
"Trusty silicone turner! Durable too! Don't let its big turner and seemingly short handle fool you! It is actually the perfect size! My mom borrowed it for some intense use (saute vegetables, fried rice, and even grilling salmon) and she loved how it held up. Definitely will get it again!  EDITED: I noticed some reviewers saying how the handle/silicone melts. The silicone/handle are not meant to handle high heat for long periods of time (i.e. letting it sit in the pan or letting the handle sit on the edge of the pan), so of course it'll melt that way. Smh."
"This is the best turner money can buy. The Silicone turner is flexible enough to slide under just about anything no matter the pan shape. Compared to other plastic type turners I have, food sticks to this one a lot less. The metal plate inside the silicone gives a great level of support and strength. This thing is very heat resistant, you could leave it touching the bottom of a hot iron skillet and it won't melt (something I have had a problem with before).  These do eventually wear out, especially if the edges get cut. I wouldn't recommend putting this is the dishwasher against a knife, for instance, and you shouldn't cut directly on the turner. This is my second one, the last one I had the handle eventually got some melted spots on it, so it is worth noting the handle is not able to stand 600 degree heat."
"I bought this turner to replace an old, battered, plastic spatula that we had had for about fifteen years. I've always been more than happy with the Good Grips products we've tried, so we purchased this one. So far, it's been great! It hasn't scratched any of our pots and pans, is as heat-resistant as it says it should be, and cleans up easily (food seems to wipe right off and not get caked on it, even if the food has dried a bit).  I actually purchased both this and the ""small"" Good Grips turner, thinking that this one would be more ""normal"" sized. It turns out that when Good Grips says ""large,"" they definitely mean LARGE! (Silly me for not looking more carefully at the dimensions on this.) This is one large turner, and so far has served us best in serving up pizza slices, flipping quesadillas, etc. The smaller-sized one is more of the go-to turner we use for everyday cooking."
I've had one of these for years and the silicon coating finally broke on me. I've dishwashed it since I got it and never had any problems until recently when the silicon cracked (no proof that was the dishwashing but seems like there was something I'd read about not dishwashing but I dishwash everything... Anything that can't do it I won't use).  This is my favorite spatula I've ever had and works great because it isn't super rigid like every plastic or metal ones I can find and doesn't melt like plastic ones do.
Just replaced the one we had for about 10 years- used the last one multiple times every week- washed by hand at times but also put in the dishwasher. Held up a long time and immediately ordered the exact same spatula when the tip cracked.
These are the perfect mix of being hard enough to pick up food but soft enough not to scratch your coated pans. The weigh is just right as well. Being easy to clean seals the deal.
"Most people know the kind of quality OXO products are and this is no exception. Dishwasher safe, heat resistant, and ergonomic. It's really everything you want and nothing you don't."
This is my go-to when I'm cooking using a non-stick pan. I cook a ton of omelettes and this is thin enough to slide underneath them and has a big enough surface to lift and flip the entire omelette without breaking it. If it ever breaks then I'll definitely buy another one. Highly recommend it.
"I have been searching for months to find a smaller spatula, i have ordered and retured lots of them. I cam across this thinking that is was going to be another large spatula, but it is a great size, it is perfect with out being huge. east to clean, sturdy and is comfortable in the hand."
"I simply love this spatula those compassion mark It feels really good in my hand. I also have a much easier time turning pancakes, hamburgers, or any other food that requires flipping over. This is very well made and it is rated the number one spatula in my kitchen. I'm so happy I made this purchase :-)"
"It‚Äôs good, easy to clean too. I ordered this to replace my previous one which I had been using for several years. But compare to the old one, this handle is a bit shorter. I prefer a longer one!"
"Received this in a timely fashion, and I am so pleased to add this to my kitchen arsenal for great cooking experience. My sister had this and I had purposed to get myself one because I was frustrated with my tools melting at the edges even with keeping burner and pan temps down. The highest temp ratings on reputable tools I could find were 450 deg F, and the edges were already gnarling with just a few uses - and I am not rough on my tools! Short of filing the edges of my spatulas each use, I didn't know what else to do. This spatula is rated up to 600 deg F, which is way more hot than I go on stovetop. It handles really really well, and from a great manufacturer that produces thoughtful and innovative tools. I am a happy camper!"
"this is what i thought/hoped it would be. it's what i want out of a simple cheap plastic turner. perfect for eggs. if i could change two things, i'd get rid of the metal spacer and endcap (possible point of failure/rust), and give it a little more flex (is a little stiff for my taste). but, after a few uses, it's good for what it is imo. would buy again assuming it lasts a while.  will update this review if/when anything changes, but so far this seems to be a decent standard plastic turner."
"You can't go wrong with products from KitchenAid. I was searching for a spatula to use with my non-stick cookware and was quick to choose this one when I saw the brand. I was not disappointed as the spatula is sturdy and well made. The end is not flexible which is a good thing, in my mind. I had another rubber spatula with a flexible end and it was nearly impossible to stir food in the skillet. This spatula cleans easily and is an asset in my drawer of cooking utensils."
"I am constantly looking for a spatula that is firm yet flexible. I had one for years but eventually it wore out. After going through many, I stumbled on this one. It is perfect, slim enough to flex around my WOK but sturdy enough to flip large things without bending. Ordered another to hide in my closet when this one wears out."
"I know it means you're old when you have a favorite spatula but it is what it is. This is my favorite spatula! It is just great. Not floppy, holds up to heat and you can throw it in the dishwasher. What's not to love?"
"I am an Executive Chef. And I use this in my house. Not sure about the other reviews, I love it. Length is just right, stiffness too. Heat resistance has been fine, no issues there, but then I don‚Äôt leave my spatulas on a burner and walk out of the room, so there‚Äôs that. All in all, this is exactly what I wanted and I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase."
"I‚Äôve been searching for a durable and solid spatula, and I‚Äôve finally found it in this one! Super happy with the quality and weight. I‚Äôll be ordering extras for when this one is in the dishwasher."
"Nice and sturdy. Easy to clean. Compared to our old KitchenAid turner which was hard to part with, I have noticed a marked improvement in pancake flipping performance. We are very please with our investment."
"Great turner overall, rigid enough to even cut cakes in non stick tray (using on non stick was my first reason to get it) for the price it‚Äôs a very nice turner. Feel‚Äôs very solid."
It‚Äôs so hard to find a none silicone one and this is perfect and exactly what I was looking for
It has a long handle and a medium sized blade. The blade is think and flexible enough to get under eggs. The handle doesn't trap water like some others.
Very sturdy. Able to flip pancakes and eggs easily. Cleans easily. Best one I have had so far and I am a senior! Yay! Would definitely recommend it.
"I really enjoy it. Has a good weight, very firm and easy to clean. Good ergonomics in the grip."
"Exactly what I was looking for! If you are looking for a spatula that has little flexibility to it, this is the one!"
"This is a great spatula. It's a good size, made of solid materials, feels good in your hand, and does well in the dishwasher. I ended up buying a second one. I regret wasting money on a cheap rubber set before I found this one."
"Nice upgrade from the Dollar Store one, only complaint is there isn't a hole to hang it up with."
Solid and well made
"I love this! It is sturdy in the hand and easy too clean. Feels durable for the long term. Best with larger pans, than small pans. No problems with heat so far."
"It won‚Äôt connect to my WiFi, but it does a good job flipping my eggs in the morning..I recommend it!!"
The product is well built with a thin edge at the end that makes cutting and browning hamburger an easy chore.
This spatula saved us from certain cancer. My husband had insisted there was nothing wrong with the mutilated spatula we had. This spatula came in a timely manner and works great.
"Sturdy with a surface part which makes slipping under eggs, grilled sandwiches and cookies very easy!"
Very thick & sturdy. Strongest and most heavy duty spatula I've ever owned. Definitely recommend.
Works well. Sturdy and should last a long time.
Love this spatula! I cook every day with it.
It‚Äôs sturdy and skeek
This is a very good product. My only complaint is that the handle is too long.
Great value and sturdy. It‚Äôs slightly larger than I expected but turned out to be just right.
I like the quality of this spatula. It is easy to clean because food does not stick to it easily.
This is the perfect sized spatula!!
It's very sturdy and handles heat very well. Handle feels great as well.
I was actually surprised at how heavy and durable this felt. Would recommend!
Feels like a solid quality kitchen tool. Nice feel in my hands.
Very nice and solid!
Well Made Sturdy And Easy To Clean
"This is great! A lot sturdier than I was expecting. We wanted one without slats, so it‚Äôs super easy to clean."
Great spatula!
Perfect size and heat resistance. Just what I wanted
"It‚Äôs a very sturdy, easy to hold spatula. Would recommend"
"I feel like you cannot go wrong with Kitchen Aid. Solid turner, does exactly what I need it to."
"Perfect size, easy to clean and lightweight get heavy duty"
Very good spatula. Much easier to clean than my last silicone spatula.
great price.
"It‚Äôs thinner than our other spatulas for nonstick pans, and yet has held up very well."
Spatula didn‚Äôt hold up for even one use. Turning eggs caused it to melt on turning edge. Now there is no longer an edge to get under things.
Just what we wanted
This one seems so far so good.
Great turner.
Quick delivery. Item as described.
Works well for cooking. Has gone through dishwasher many times without discoloration.
GOOD SURFACE AREA
Great value and quality
Love it and use it every morning!
Not disappointed
Very durable
Great spatula
perfectly weighted. not too light and not too heavy. easy to clean because it's solid.
Nice size for everyday use in the kitchen.
"very thick and sturdy, kinda hard to maneuvre with in a smaller pan"
THANKS
Works great!
Wife uses it everyday!
Just what I was looking for
"Its sturdy, you don't get burned holding it, and it's easy to clean"
Good looking and sturdy
I love the kitchen aide tools.
very sturdy spatula. does not melt even with extreme heat. would recommend to anyone. :)
nice product.

"I purchased KitchenAid because I thought it was a quality product, but it is made in China."
"I was hoping a brand name like KitchenAid would provide me with a turner that would not flake when used with my nonstick cookware. Unfortunately, after only about 3 uses, it's already starting to show wear! Very disappointing."
"For those with silicone spatula experience, you will know that silicone spatulas can vary greatly in flexibility. Some are not sturdy enough, and some are very stiff, designed more for doughs and very dense batters. These spatulas are perfectly in the middle of the range. They are not at all flimsy. They have a heavyweight core and feel very sturdy/quality. However, the sides of the heads have just enough flex to bend to the shape of whatever bowl or pot you are using. I've been enjoying them for several months now and still have nothing but good things to say. I am always hesitant to purchase this sort of thing without seeing it in person, but in this case, I'm very pleased with the outcome - to boot, they are a great price. Win win!"
Exactly as described.I use the product now for a few weeks. The spatulas have performed perfectly. Very nice clean edge and has been working perfectly with my nonstick cookware.
Perfect set of 3 spatulas with sturdy handles in a variety of sizes.
Just as advertised.
My none stick pots.
"Sturdy, easy to clean"
"Well-made, seems like good quality, good length, good weight, the steel inside gives the spatulas a stiffness which is useful for cooking and stirring but maybe not so efficient when scraping clean the sides of a pot. I like the higher temperature rating for peace of mind but haven't actually tested it for anything over 450 F. I find the handle length is long enough to keep my hand away from the splatter of hot oil or sauce but not so long to be unwieldy when cooking with 7 to 10 inch pots and pans. I mainly use the large spatula for cooking and the small spatula for scooping and spreading things like peanut butter."
Highly recommended; I would definitely buy these again.
"Was not expecting them to be so high quality, do not feel cheap what so ever. Extremely worth the price!"
We bought this because we were in need of a new small spatula. The price was great so we purchased. When received it and used it was blown away from sturdy they were made and how comfortable it was.. this not cheaply made product but a great one!!
Great price for the quality of spatulas and high heat resistance compared to other options. Very sturdy in the handle through the spatula part.
"These spatulas are quite excellent. Much better than the spatula that came with my Cuisinart food processor, which broke under relatively modest pressure. These spatulas seem indestructible, practically. They have a little bit of flex, which make them very effective removing food from containers while presenting no risk of damaging anything. Strongly recommended."
"I am very happy with these. They are solid, like metal, but are covered with a nice silicone material. Very tough but will not harm your non-stick pans or Ninja Cookers."
"This is the first time I have used silicone spatulas in fry pans and pots. They are so easy to use and hold up to everything I have needed them to do. Sturdy, flexible and incredibly easy to clean. I have even used them to flip an omelette."
"I've used them daily for a couple months now. Always clean up easily with no hints of wear. Sturdy, and doesn't melt when left in contact with a hot skillet."
These are our new favorites. I've already tossed the old stuff into the give away pile.
Just what I was looking for.
"Great sizes, flexibility and won't scratch your pans like metal or plastic."
"Seem very sturdy and durable, yet they are flexible enough to do the job. Others I'd purchased were very flimsy at the top."
Great product. Exactly what I was looking for. Old spatulas we leaving particles in food. These are great.
"It is perfect for this baker. one tool to scrape, stir, fold and wash."
Sturdy and great to fold dough etc. Replaces the plastic ones that felt vulnerable with larger volumes of dough (upward from two cups of flour).
The build is solid but the end spatula part isn't sturdy enough and bends.
Nice quality and good sizes.
"Poor design. The steel shank in the handle extends just a few centimeters into the silicone spatula heads, so if you press on the spatula head with any force it immediately begins to cut through. I opened the box, gave them a little test flex, and immediately sent them back."
Spatulas are really practical because you get three different sizes that you can use for different sorts of food and different size pans. Good on nonstick especially ceramic. I was happy to find them.
"These were a few bucks less than a better known brand. Until I got to use them, I was concerned with stiffness or flexibility. They are PERFECT! Super happy w these."
Just what I hoped for.
They were perfect and three great sizes for various use in the kitchen when cooking or even when baking !
I bought them for flipping eggs; they do an excellent job.
"Sturdy, washing well and doesn‚Äôt scratch pans. Great price!"
I like how sturdy these are. Used for baking and I non stick skillet. Pleased with this product.
Very nice design and manufacture
Great spatula! Only Complaint is the handle shafts are to short.
I purchased this set based on the reviews even though it was more money than the others. I thought i would spend a little more and get a better quality but after I had used the longer narrower one a few times I notice my expensive non-stick pan was scratched but couldn't figure out how until I looked on the bottom the the spatula and noticed the metal was exposed on each edge and scratched my pans. The warranty on it is 30 days and i didn't notice this until 3 days after they would take it back. Buyer beware...
Just started to use them and so far so good.
Came quickly very well packaged and well worth the money. Used one to flip burgers last evening Spatula did its job well.
Like the sizes and how sturdy they are.
Handy item
Just as described.
Love it !
I had purchased a silicone spoon spatula many years ago and have loved it and used it up! I'm not sure that the one that I had purchased years ago was heat resistant but I used it trying to get every last little bit out of a hot pan. I definitely have enjoyed it but it was time that I get a new one and so I opted for this set these are so much sturdier than my original and the handle is definitely longer. The short handle had not been an issue with my last one but it will be nice to have that extra length. For the money this is really nice. And I would definitely buy it again
Very good value
"I love these turners as they have just enough flex, don't scrap nonstick pans, easily slide under anything I'm turning. Would have been 5 star if the middle turner were longer."
"Robustesse, qualit√©. Tr√®s satisfaite."
Happy with products...
"I enjoy using these because the tip is slightly flexible which makes it easy to scoop up food at the edge of the pans. This is my second time ordering one, the metal underneath the silicone wound up piercing through the silicone tip however it did last at least 5 years before this issue occurred."
"I wasn't happy with my old spatula - it's too thick, too narrow, and annoying to clean - so I gave this a try.  Already they've been a huge improvement over what I had. The spatula 'blade' is thin and flexible enough to easy slip under food, and its smooth enough that thus far nothing has stuck to it. I bought this set expecting to use the wider one, but discovered that the smaller one was already a huge improvement over what I had. Well worth what I paid for it.  That said, I've only used this in a nonstick skillet - I have a seasoned cast iron skillet, but haven't needed to use it lately. One downside of the thin and flexible spatula 'blade' has been a near-complete inability to scrape anything stuck to the pan off, and that may become an issue when I next use the iron skillet. I'll update this review once that happens."
"This seems to be an excellent product. I purchased this set to replace a couple of plastic spatulas that slowly melt each time I use them with my cast iron. These not only don't melt, they do the job very well. There is thin metal inside the silicone, which makes them plenty sturdy for picking things up, but also flexible and able to slide down the edge of the skillet and get under things."
I wasn't expecting much the the cost but these are very nice. They are perfect for non stick
"I bought these about 5 months ago and they were lovely until recently.  The silicone coating eventually wears down and begins to peel up, it isn't entirely stuck to the metal spatula inside. As the metal bits begin to poke out they easily scratch at non-stick pans and the silicone easily lifts up as you turn any sort of small, granulated or soft food like scrambled eggs or ground meats, allowing food debris to become trapped INSIDE of the spatula rendering it impossible to clean without peeling off the silicone(making it useless) and largely unsanitary and unsafe otherwise.  They work so well up until they break you'll probably notice your pan scratched up by the exposed metal before you notice the little bit of broken silicone.  Unless mine was faulty, they only seem to last 6 months tops with normal use."
"Bought these to replace cheap nylon spatulas at our rental cabin. These don‚Äôt have holes in them like many nylon spatulas do, and which renters frequently fail to get clean. These are flexible, don‚Äôt melt, and are easy to wash."
"This is a great combo pack, because both sizes are very useful. The high temperatures they can withstand make using a stress free experience- because no worries of chemicals melting in your food! The only slight downfall is the tips are not reinforced with a stronger ‚Äúinner plate‚Äù and because of this if you were to be scraping something off your saucepan, example: burnt cheese, the end/tips flex and thus cannot scrape, as a harder plastic spatula would (and would probably be melting too lol)... there are other ways around this, but is slightly annoying because less tools to clean in the kitchen is always better!"
"After looking at a number of other options at retail stores and even cooking specialty stores, I could not find a good spatula that was both flexible and sturdy. I wanted something that I could use on both non-stick or stainless steel pans, heat resistant and with enough flexibility in the spatula area that I could press it into the pan and get a little flex if I needed to get around the edge of pan. These are exactly that... The silicone over stainless steel makes them largely non-stick while cooking but also allows for enough flex to get around the rounded edges of a frying pan. These are the perfect size for general cooking and flipping. The large one should be suitable for pancakes (have yet to try). They clean up well. The handle is silicone over stainless steel as well."
"These are THE best set of flippers for non scratch cookware - very sturdy both in the handles and silicone ends and comfortable to hold/use. They easily get under the food to lift or turn. Especially for eggs, and other delicate foods as well as heavier food items that need a strong control while cooking. These spatulas are able to maneuver easily around and under to gather in the object being cooked to prevent tearing or burning and to to maintain cohesion and control over the food item. Rated to 600 deg F, there is no concern about the silicone tips melting or detaching into the food. I am very very impressed with the quality of the utensils, they are well worth their price.  UPDATE: After 8 months of use the smaller spatula has begun to separate in a front corner. These apparently NOT as good as I thought and I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Will no one rid us of this imported junk!!"
"FINALLY, EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR. Until these I have been very disappointed with every silicone spatula I have purchased as they are never firm enough and the ends are too thick so I can‚Äôt pick up food or scrape the frying pan. These have none of the usual problems. Also, because they are not slotted, food doesn‚Äôt get stuck between the slots. I believe they have been constructed with a piece of metal inside the silicone which has created some firmness to the spatula. Also, food doesn‚Äôt get stuck between the slots like others since they are a solid piece. I haven‚Äôt left them in a hot frying pan ‚Äúyet‚Äù so I don‚Äôt know if the handles will melt when leaned against a hot rim. However, there is the long piece of metal on the handle between the ‚Äúflipper‚Äù and the upper part so one should be able to avoid leaning it directly against a hot pan."
"These seem like a cut above your typical plastic spatulas, even well-known ones like OXO (which I have and has definitely melted on the edge). They seem really well and solidly made. High quality, sturdy stainless steel handle that goes all the way inside the spatula head. Most importantly, the rubber spatula head seems very high quality. Not flimsy at all and is not melting at all in the slightest so far. I like that it's tapered at the end to get under things easily.  The only thing to be aware of is that the large one is pretty large. Good for something sizable like a fish fillet. Too large for me for regular use, but handy if you need it. The smaller one is perfectly sized for typical needs.  Edit: I just visited their store page and they offer a 2-pack with smaller sized spatulas. I would have gotten that had I known"
Best set of spatulas I've ever had. I have used and ABUSED these suckered for 8 months. I do a LOT of cooking for a lot of folks and I'm extremely hard on these guys. The smaller one started to break down and separate at the tip. The failure is 100% my fault because of how I use them. Honestly suprised it lasted this long. 6 months in I was starting to believe it was indestructible. Worth evey penny of the $10 I spent. Ordering a new set right now.  Thanks the our former vice president the inflation on these now the price is nearly $13. Buy them before they cost $20.
"The small one is the one I wanted, and it is actually thin enough to actually slide under cooking and flip it, not just push it around the non-stick pan like every other spatula I've tried. Looks cool, too and washes off with a soapy sponge. I haven't had it more than a couple of weeks, but it looks like the plastic / rubber part is going to hold up well, and it does not scratch a non-stick surface. Whoever put it together did a great job of balancing the internal metal support with the external surface. It actually works to slip under light stuff like frying onions and flip it, and it can be used for heavier stuff like hamburger without bending."
"I absolutely love these. Super easy to clean and obviously won‚Äôt scratch up your frying pan. The larger of the 2 was much larger that I was expecting, but that wasn‚Äôt a problem, just thought I‚Äôd mention it."
"these things are awesome! flipping everything has become easy-peasy.. they are obviously flat, but have a special front addition, which is very sturdy, but flexible, that can easily slide under ANYTHING!! i mean, anything! especially eggs that have to be perfect sunny-side up and not runny! or other things that might not be generally easy to flip or get under.  they are well made and just awesome. i'm super picky about spatula's, as my other ones are too small or not wide enough.. these ones are both wide and larger and have a reasonable handle size that is sturdy and not crazy long!  worth it! will be buying more!"
"We have used this spatula for over 4 years. It is heat resistant but the handle did slightly melt when I placed it on the edge of a hot pan so just be careful ie it's not heat proof. I love that it's non stick which makes it easy to use and very easy to clean. The edge is thin which is good for getting under food. I made the mistake of putting too much pressure on the edge while cleaning so after 4 years of use, it slowly tore where the metal ends. I emailed them about getting a replacement and they sent it right away! An amazing company that actually stands behind their product. I am thoroughly satisfied. The replacement spatula is of the same quality. When I clean the spatula, I now place one hand under the edge while washing it with the other hand."
"Don't judge me I tried to get your attention.  These are good, I'm happy with them use them frequently. they haven't fallen apart in the dishwasher and they fit in my drawer which loves to get stuff stuck when you're trying to open it. My drawer likes these as well, they are all friends.  Enough said"
"EDIT: June 2022: Both of these failed around the same time, after slightly more than 2 years of daily use. The silicone started to tear and, while it was still working, I didn't feel that I was able to clean it sufficiently. I have purchased two more as this seems like it lasted a reasonable amount of time for the price.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had one of the smaller sized ones before and I loved it. The best part is that you can cook over high heat in stainless or cast iron and it won't melt and poison your food unlike the other plastic junk out there which melts at 400 degrees. I like the springy, flexible metal but my wife prefers a more rigid and heavy spatula for breaking up meats in the pan. This won't let you cut up meat in the pan or anything like that, but for turning it's great."
"I had a similar Oxo product which is my usual brand of choice, but that spatula broke long before I would have ever expected. It had a weakness on the front corners where the metal ends and only the silicone exists and the silicone cracked to reveal the metal.  This brand was cheaper than the Oxo and I thought it looked very similar so I doubted if it would be any worse and maybe even better. The quality seems fine and so far so good for how it's holding up. The overall flexibility of the shaft is less stiff, but I feel that's just a difference and not a flaw."
"These are perfect for non stick pans. I personally prefer a sturdy steel blade, but not on a Teflon pan. The only place these fall short is in the edge, you can't scrape. Last set lasted me a few years, but the steel spine will eventually cut the silicone cover. Until then you will like them. Make sure you buy the silicone spatula and not the plastic. The plastic ones are sh17"
"I hated my spatulas where the plastic would melt off on the edge after so many uses. Not these! They‚Äôre very durable. I love the sizes. One is huge which is great for grilled cheese and pancakes. They‚Äôre easy to clean (I just use the top rack of the dishwasher). I‚Äôd buy them again, but I probably won‚Äôt have to!"
"I really love these spatulas. I thought I would only use the smaller one, but I have found lots of uses for the larger one too. I read other reviews about the metal breaking through the silicone, but I have used both of them ALOT and have not had that issue. One issue I have had with the spatula, is that the handle is not heat resistant. So the handle has multiple melted marks from setting it against hot pots and in turn my pots ended up with melted black plastic on them. This is why I knocked down the rating on heat resistance. This is the only negative in the product."
"I like these spatulas. They are unlike any that I have bought before but, I'm happy with them. I like the way the metal runs almost all the way through the silicone. I also like how heavy they feel in my hand. They are thin enough at the end to get under the food without tearing it up while being plenty strong enough to carry food from the pan to the plate. I do not own a dishwasher but these were very easy to clean by hand. I am happy with this purchase."
Corner broke off after fewer than a dozen uses and just 11 days after the return window closed. üò¶ü§îüò§
"So far we‚Äôve loved these. We love using our nonstick pans, but we‚Äôre always afraid to scratch with metal utensils. We‚Äôve melted a few hard plastic spatulas over the years and get tired hand washing wooden spatulas. These things are amazing tools, and so far have been a dream to clean. Haven‚Äôt tried washing in our dishwasher yet, but hand washing them has been so fast and easy. Will update with any issues."
"Unicook 2 Pack Flexible Silicone Spatula have been a great purchase. My husband never liked my small one I had so this one looked like I would like it and he could have his big one too. I like that they have a thin tip to easily get under your eggs. These withstand heat without melting, that's nice for using on the grill like my honey likes to do. I think it's cause the metal grill ones are soo dang hard to clean. These are breeze to clean and store. Glad I found these."
"Nice silicon spatulas. The ends are thin so you slip them under anything you'd want to flip, they have just the right amount of flex. They're reinforced so they are strong enough to flip heavier stuff. I like having two useful sizes, the larger one is good for nice large pancakes.They seem great, if anything odd happens I'll update the review."
"Perfect egg, pancake, French toast, and soft foods flipper. It does lack in things like chopping hamburgers but that isnt why I bought it. The flexible edges will act like a squeegee for sides of pans when scrambling eggs. Best compliment I can give them is my wife actually said she liked my impulse buy. The yolks doesn't cake up on these and are by far the easiest spatula I have to clean. I highly reccomend this product."
Received these today and put to immediate use. The edge is thin and flexanle to make it easier to turn over food open a pan. These are well made with a stainless steel shaft making it easy to clean. Very happy with the quality of the product and quick delivery. These are a excellent buy for a week made product
"Initially I read the reviews on this product‚Ä¶they convinced me to try them bc we were in desperate need for new ones. My hubby (our family cook) loves them and uses them daily actually. They‚Äôre solid but flexible and heat resistant too. Overall, they‚Äôre wonderful so far. I‚Äôm just hoping they will sustain for a long while?!"
"I have been trying to find a turner that won't mess up my carbon steel and cast iron, is stiff enough to actually turn things, is flexible enough to get up under eggs, and won't melt when I crank up the heat to sear something. Guess what, the small one in this package does all of that. The bigger one has a little to much flex in it for most of my applications, but for this price it was just an extra anyway."
"I bought these spatulas to withstand high heat ( without melting on the edges like so many other products do :-0 I am delighted with this product...it works well on all sorts of hot pans, doesn‚Äôt melt or fray on the edges, and feels much healthier to use than some of the standard ( even high-end) competitors. I will buy more, and highly recommend it to other cooks."
"I love these. They are super nice! All I had left in my kitchen were these bendy awful old things that were half melted and ancient as the hills. These are very lovely and sturdy, with easy to grip handles that are cool to the touch. They clean very easily. Highly recommend these if you need new ones or if you‚Äôre setting up your kitchen."
"I waited a couple months before writing a review because I read from some others that the spatulas didn‚Äôt seem to last long. I think they‚Äôre good quality and they work so well with nonstick pans. I treat them gently and have not had any issues so far. Hopefully, they will last long, long time."
"I finally decided to replace a pliable spatula that my cousin gave me that was burnt, and had a crack in it but was so good I had been holding on to it. Not only do I love the size of these I love the feel and pliability. These are like those spatulas you use to scrape batter out of a bowl and a spatula combined. They are perfectly thick and feel like they are sturdy and well made. A huge plus, will definitely be recommending."
"So far, no complaints. In the past I had an OXO spatula that finally needed to be replaced. The silicone started to rip, exposing the metal spatula in the middle. This set was more reasonably priced and I don't notice a difference yet. Time will tell to see if this is as durable as the OXO spatula. This set comes in 2 nice sizes. One is a standard spatula size and the other is oversized. Would highly recommend! Great to use on non-stick cookware,"
I was in need of a spatula and found these on Amazon. I ordered them hoping for the best. When I receive them they were beyond my expectation! One was pretty big and the other one was just right. They are flexible enough to slide under pancakes but sturdy enough to lift heavier foods. Great addition to my utensils!
I like how thin and flexible these are. My only wish is that they were slightly slicker. You how silicon tools have just a teeeeeny bit of texture? You can over come that by putting a bit of oil/cooking spray on the Spatula first
"These spatulas are solid, professional construction, have a nice weight to them, a perfect angle for lifting food off surfaces, and easy-to-grip handles. The difference in size between them is perfect. Very happy with this purchase. Would recommend to friends."
"I love these! The large one is EXTREMELY large - like comically large. At first, I was like ""I don't think i'll ever use this because of how large it is!"" but as it turns out, I actually love having the large spatula. It's fantastic for flipping omelets and pancakes, and for getting multiple cookies off the tray at once."
"I collected non-stick spatulas over time, each purchase intended to overcome the deficiencies of its immediate predecessor. Over time they have lost their edge, literally; been burned when resting on the edge of pans, or simply never did the job very well. This pair seems to be the best I have bought so far. The metal shank reduces the probability of being burned by the edge of the pan."
"It‚Äôs a nice, sturdy spatula. However, I bought it to use for lifting and turning delicate items, such as eggs cooked over easy. It‚Äôs look is deceptive, as it appears to be thin and flexible, but the business end is a bit too thick and firm to be gentle enough to perform such a fragile task. Kinda like when you go to a new gynecologist because you heard that he‚Äôs just a little guy, so you think all is well. Then you meet him, and you notice that he has hands like Andre The Giant. (That egg is gonna get some damage). Would not recommend for jobs which require a tender touch."
"I purchased these spatulas for flipping eggs, and they are great - as long as you are aggressive enough to get under the yolk sufficiently. The first few times I wasn't, and the eggs slid right off, but afterward, the eggs stayed on just fine and flipped well. I am happy with my purchase."
"I love how these spatulas stand up to the heat. They don‚Äôt melt or break into the food, it‚Äôs great. Finally after daily use (I usually cook three meals a day for my family of 6) the spatula metal pierced through the rubber. So, I cooked approximately 2,000 meals with these before they broke. Definitely worth the money and buying my second set today. I also gifted these to family members that love to cook."
"I bought these to use to keep from scratching non-stick pans, and I think they're great. They're sturdy, but not too stiff or soft.  I did have one handle melt a bit, against the edge of a hot pan, but other than that I like them, especially for the price."
"I've been hanging on to a broken spatula (with no handle) for a couple years because I didn't want to ""put the time in"" researching a silicone replacement. With two sizes per set this is all I need for my non-stick needs. Love them!"
"Very well made, high quality material. Having been irritated with inexpensive no-stick spatulas that had flimsy handles which loosened up and blades whose edges melted at high temperatures, I overrode my thrifty wife and purchased these. Apparently she also was impressed because when I surreptitiously tossed out the others she didn't comment. After some months' use I now suspect we will never have to purchase replacements...bad for the manufacturer but good for us!"
These spatulas are just what we needed and a great value! My husband who never comments on kitchen utensils mentioned how great they are as he was cooking his eggs just this morning. Would definitely but again.
If I could buy a million of these and give them to everyone I know I would. They are the best spatulas I have ever used. I was doubtful of the shape of them at first but they did NOT disappoint. They are amazing and I use them almost every day!! I have other spatulas that will be clean and these two will be dirty in the dishwasher and I will literally get them out and clean them to use them before I use another type of spatula. Worth every penny.
"Never ever have to look for another spatula, because these will not burn up, melt, or chip away. I, unfortunately, cook on high heat and will melt any other kind of spatula. This is perfect. Don't think of another kind of spatula (except of course metal for cast iron) for your skillet needs! Highly recommend."
These are great spatulas. They don't scratch and they glide across a pan with ease - even a foil covered pan without tearing it. The two sizes have been very convenient for different tasks and I've actually made pretty fried eggs instead of the crumpled egg balls I'm usually known for. Inexpensive and pops into the dishwasher with no fuss.
"Just admit it, you hate a favorite spatula and this one might just be mine! It‚Äôs great on my (very expensive) le creuset nonstick pan and it washes up well in the dishwasher. What more could one ask for?"
My previous spatula began giving of tiny speckles of plastic. I never knew why anyone would spend more for a spatula until that happened and then I discovered that the plastic was not developed to use with high temperatures so I bought these and am very happy with them.
"My plastic spatulas were literally falling apart so I decided it was time to get new ones. These feel well-made and it's awesome that they come with two different sizes. They feel like they will last a long time. The silicone part is pretty slippery, so watch out while cooking eggs... I've had some slide right off, but makes cleaning very easy!"
"I only wish that the handles were a little longer. While using a large skillet my wrist is right around the edge of the skillet, that's where the most heat is, especially while using a gas cooktop."
Very well made. Been using for awhile now and hasn't fell apart not rips or tears. Just don't set handles on the pan they will melt don't ask how I know.
"Can you ever have too many nice spatulas in the kitchen? Almost everyone in our home cooks or bakes, so we are always competing for them. They are well made, hold up to the heat, and have a nice combination of flex and firmness."
My dad loves having his own spatula set. They work great and haven‚Äôt burnt up or been ruined by his cooing yet. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a plus and that they do indeed work well.
"These were ordered as a gift for a relative. She uses them almost daily and says they are just the right thickness, whether for pancakes or fish. They are sturdy and do well in the dishwasher. Highly recommend."
"These are thin enough so it is easy to slide under food in the pan, they are rigid enough you have good control even when they are loaded down with weight, these are the best spatulas I think I have ever owned"
"I like these a lot. They are flexible, main reason I bought them. They also have a handle that DOES NOT fill with water after cleaning them. That was was wrong with many of the other spatula's I had purchased. So I really like these a lot."
"Just enough bend and flexibility in the silicon and great support inside it. The shaft is a bit thin at first glance but, seems to be working great. The curve in the metal giving the right strength but just the right give as well."
""
These spatulas are great for getting under the food you are trying to flip. The larger one worked very well for turning the egg over the toppings and cheese in an omelet. Flexible enough to get under and gently flip fried eggs too.
Bought these to replace some more expensive silicone spatulas that I had gotten damaged after a few years of use. So far these are exactly the same and have held up for a few months so I would say a good purchase and great value for half the price of what I paid for the others. Nice and flexible bouncey silicone style that won‚Äôt scrape your pans.
I absolutely love this product! It may seem crazy to get excited about spatulas but I was so tired to teflon designs that can't old up to heat and scratch up/therefore stuff would stick in the scratches and you couldn't get them clean. This silicone design is really heat resilient and the thinness of the tip allows perfect egg and pancake flipping. Very easy to clean and doesn't scratch like teflon ones. The handle is comfortable too. I recommend for anyone who enjoys a good hamburger or fried egg!
"Especially like the beveled edges and how relatively easy they are to clean in the dishwasher. Work fine in all temperature ranges we have encountered so far. They are heavy duty enough to handle all our flipping needs so far. The two sizes supplied add to the versatility.  Hands down, the best spatulas we have had in our 53 years of kitchen accessories."
"Best spatulas ever. Almost got ripped off at the grocery store for one small spatula that wasn't even heat resistant for a higher price. This was a 2-pack. Large one is a really nice large size - great for my cast iron skillet. The smaller one is more of a ""standard"" size you'd get with a utensil set. Very happy with this purchase."
"Needed something that would flex under objects in frying pan. These were the best. Pancakes, eggs, saute onions-mushrooms-peppers, hamburger. You name it, you can get under it and flip it. The BEST. Sturdy, strong, and easy to clean."
These silicone spatulas are holding up well after several weeks of use. I find the larger one works well flipping omelets and turning over grilled sandwiches.
Weird thing to review because it seems such a simple kitchen tool but it is actually better than any other spaghetti spoon I‚Äôve used. The reason is the material they use. It seems to be some sort of glass reinforced polymer. I‚Äôve had other brands that turned chalky white after washing or get soft when scooping hot pasta but these don‚Äôt have that issue. You wouldn‚Äôt think you need to review a spoon but this thing works so much better than the others that I decided to tell people about it
"The spaghetti server that came with the utensil set I got as a wedding gift many years ago finally broke recently and I needed a new one. I have had a great experience with OXO products so I ordered this expecting it would be no different. Indeed it has done its job well and seems sturdy and well made. I like the material of the handle and the length of the wand. I like the shape of the basket as well as it is wider and not quite as deep as my old one. That enables it to scoop up tortellini or ravoli in addition to long thin pastas like angel hair, spaghetti and linguini. Let's be honest though, the best part about any kitchen utensil is the ability to throw it in the dishwasher! This bad boy is not only dishwasher safe but is heat resistant to 400 degrees. What more could you want out of spaghetti server? Short of being made of gold, this is a fine and sturdy kitchen instrument that does its job without any fuss! What more do you need to know?  I did NOT receive this item free or at a discount"
"We needed to replace an old melamine ladle on which the surface was finally becoming pockmarked and started to feel rough -- meaning it was wearing out. I was reluctant to replace it, though, because it always seemed to be the PERFECT size scoop. Well, this one exactly matched the size of the scoop, and although it's slightly longer than the melamine one, it's only just barely so, and it was exactly the replacement we needed. It holds about a half a cup (4 ounces or so) -- I had to make sure of the volume so I could make my risotto!"
"I get this almost childish sense of giddiness whenever I order an OXO kitchen product. Probably because all of the OXO products I have ever owned have lasted years, and functioned above my expectations. It's a kitchen ladle, so it's probably hard to mess up, but this one scoops and pours well and washes no problemo. You of course will need another kitchen implement (a spoon or spatula of sorts) to get all the yummy soup/ stew/ whatever you are ladling out of your pot, seeing as a ladle simply doesn't have the angles to scoop the sides of the pot. OXO will certainly have a product that can meet that need as well. :D It makes cooking more fun to have kitchen tools you enjoy using, and that's why I am willing to pay a bit more for OXO brand. Also, as an aside, please tell me I am not the only one who gets thinks of the children's song ""Aikendrum"" every time I use a ladle!"
"Bought this bad boy in 2015, and it's had a long life of soups, chili's, crockpot mashups, boiling water, even went though an old dishwasher that cooked other plastics alive. But it took a Tumblr, fell off a counter and landed on something unexpected. Broke the poor thing in half. We would never be the same.  I emailed Oxen support, and they send me a new one, even after all these years. it came in a nice boxen straight from the mail. Couldn't even tell them apart, my old Scooper was back in my pail!"
"I would not hesitate to say this could be used to spank the kids if they are bad and are trying to get into the food early. It is strong, good price, and also scoops soup, salsa, taco salad, and chicken and dumplings into a BOWL!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a sturdy masher. It easily works through the large batches of potatoes when we make them for family events. Not flimsy, does not bend or deform when used. But the magic is that without a shell around the bottom, the cleaning is as simple as rinsing under the running faucet. The only caveat is the edges for the masher part are sharp - as they need to be, so take a little care around them. If you have this in a drawer or in a crock you can scratch your hand if not careful. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to recommend."
"These lasagna turners are great, but I don't really use it for lasagna. I tend to use it as an all-purpose spatula and turner. It is very sturdy and solid, not flexible like most spatulas. This means that it can be used more like those metal turners cooks use on flatop griddles, but it is nylon so it won't damage your non-stick coated cookware. It works great for stirring thicker foods, or even chopping up things like ground meat in a frying pan. It's also easy to clean and seems to hold up to the heat well. Overall a very versatile kitchen utensil that can do the job of several others."
"I was just trying to scoop a piece of pot pie out of the pie tin when... *snap* the spoon crack in half, a piece when flying across the room somewhere I can't find it, and the sharp edge gouged a chunk out of my finger. Not cool oxo. (Picture of the spoon, pot pie (cooked) and finger attached)"
"This is, hands down, the best nylon masher I have ever used. Yes, the little lumps can be hard to work smooth, but isn't that part of the charm of real mashed potatoes? It works fast and is incredibly easy to clean. If anyone ever asked me to recommend a nylon masher, I would suggest this one without a second thought."
"Just got this spoon and I prefer to use it to ladle out stews and soups over a traditional ladle. It is so satisfying to use! The bowl of the spoon is just right, and it scoops out a healthy portion of whatever it is that you are serving. I find the handle perhaps an inch too long, but that isn't such a big deal. Maybe people with larger hands or who are taller will find it just right. It is light and very easy to wash. I've used Oxo spoons, ladles, and silicone spatulas for decades and unfortunately, they don't last for decades. Given that there is a seam in this spoon where it goes from nylon to silicone, I know years down the line it could come apart. However, I've also seen Oxo designs improve over the years and some tools last longer so I am not too concerned. Highly recommend this spoon for daily use."
Not too resistant to heat. Thought it was a larger spoon to heat my ‚Äòstuff‚Äô up with. So flic went the bic and I wish I was off on a trip man. Needles to say. Lol. Get it!  Guess it works. It ladles my soup! What more of a review do you need!  2 thumbs up
"I‚Äôm very picky about kitchen implements, particularly things that should be so easy to get right. However, I‚Äôve bought and used so many bad spoons. I therefore launched an effort to find and buy the best kitchen spoon. I ended up buying this one and the Tovolo Silicone Spoon. But this review is of the OXO one, so I‚Äôll stick to that for now.  Too many kitchen spoons are either a flat paddle, or a deep ladle but this one is in the perfect middle ground. It is also sturdy enough to stir and lift without excessive bending, and the handle is nice and comfortable. If I could change one thing I might make the handle just a little larger in diameter, but that is a very minor quibble. I also like that it doesn‚Äôt have any little crevices (like so many others) that food gets stuck in making it unhygienic.  You have to know what you are getting here, it is a nylon utensil, so it is cheap and if you leave it propped up on a searing pan you can melt it, but that feels like a user error and not a design flaw.  I put this in the dishwasher and unlike some other nylon utensils, I don‚Äôt see the material graying over time so kudos to OXO there.  All in all this is the best of the cheap kitchen spoons and is nice enough you don‚Äôt mind serving with it."
"Looking at different spatulas, I realized that some were not made equal to others! (Big surprise there!) This spatula fit my needs just fine: sturdy (the tip of the spatula slips under the food to be turned or moved and doesn't bend), the handle is one piece (water doesn't get into the handle and slowly leak out), it cleans easily and doesn't melt even in hot oil. The price is right and I'd buy this again in a snap."
"My gf was looking for a large spoon one day, and I admitted that in my bachelor days I never needed one, so why spend the money on it? But I realized that I too was looking for one, one day, and so here I am, reviewing, of all things, a large spoon. Oxo hasn't let me down in the past so, I bought theirs and 'surprised' my gf when I was able to present her with a large spoon. She jokenly said, 'your so adulting hard now'. I am, admittedly, reaching towards mid-life soooo, yeah, I've finally 'made it' haha"
"When non-stick pans arrived, there were wooden forks. I had one for years. Lost it recently. Guess what? Not only are the wooden ones not available, nor are there any forks for non-stick frying pans. I hate tongs for everything. They are cumbersome. This one arrived today and even without using I know I'm going to love it. I'm a good cook and have cooked for 50 yrs, I know my utensils. It is long though so I'm going to look for a shorter one to go along with it. I two sizes of everything. Highly recommended."
"Boy howdy! This will scoop the ever-loving soup out of your soup or soup like product. Every time I need some soup scooped I reach for this ladle. All jokes aside, its a ladle and will do what you need it to. Nice comfortable grip with just the right amount of grip where you need it. On the topic of heat resistance, probably shouldn't be left in a boiling pot, but I feel like you shouldn't do that with anything. If for some reason my mother breaks these, I will be buying these as replacements."
"We had an identical ladle for many years. Then it broke in half. It was inexpensive, utility was a 10, and 6-8 years of service. So went to order another one here. One of the prior feedbacks was OXO has a lifetime warranty. So I went to their website, found the contact link, and sent a message saying mine had broken. Attached a digital photo of the two pieces. I told them I had no idea when I got it, no receipt, no sweat they said. And immediately shipped another one FedEx. Better two than none, I completed the amazon order for a new one which we have already and have used. And the free replacement is due is several days. Just sayin'............"
"I have looked everywhere for this! Can't find these in the store anymore, i think people thought it was for use as a meat fork, like the metal fork that you use on the grill. This is an absolute necessity for cooking with non-stick pans, as any metal contact ruins them. I use this for stirring rice, pasta, scrambled eggs, or anything you don't want to displace in the pan while you're stirring. I also purchased the Calphalon Nylon Fork, but this one was a good 4 inches longer than that one, and has a more solid feel to it. Highly recommended!  EDIT: Dec 2012: i measured it, this one is only 2 and 1/2 inches longer than the Calphalon brand, it just seems longer. However, this one is rated for up to 400degF; the Calphalon fork is only rated for 250degF, and the tips of the Calphalon's tines/points have begun to bend upwards. The Oxo is still in great shape though after months of regular use."
"All my old forks just faded away - I don't know where - to be replaced by tongs. I must have a dozen pairs of tongs which I never use, all different lengths, some metal, some rubber-tipped. Some even have fingers, and they're useless, too. Food falls out of 'em, or you smash the food, there's no controlling a pair of tongs. You can't even set them down - they just flip over or roll away. I think I just kept buying them in hopes of finding a pair I could actually USE!  I was going through my utensils the other day and I thought, ""I have all these tongs, but I don't have a single cooking fork.""  So I came looking for one, but I couldn't find any. Which really ticked me off. Did you know that, if you search for ""cooking fork,"" Amazon doesn't have any? Neither do those folks over at Google - you have to look for a BBQ fork just to get in the right section. You can forget about your local grocery, Target, Home Depot, or other department store. They have NONE! (Where did they all go?)  When I got to this section, I found all you cooking fork connoisseurs debating the fine points of stiffness vs. flexibility, the number and the spacing of tines, and judging them based upon the Bacon Scale (who knew there even was such a thing?). I just wanted a fork that was long enough to let me spear my food in a hot pan without burning my fingers.  So I just ordered this Oxo, cause it's a name I know. I don't know if it's any better or worse than any other cooking fork out there. But when I took this bad boy out of the package and used it for the first time, I said ""This is what's been missing from my kitchen all these years!"" I could see my mother, my aunts, and both grandmothers at their stoves, forks in hand. I could envision the first cave woman who tied a couple of sticks together to make herself a cooking fork, because one HAD to be made! And I knew I had made the right decision and I am so happy with my new cooking fork! Just jump in and get yourself one - you know you want it."
"Spoon section shallow and small; handle very long. I should have paid more attention to length measurement. I find the handle length more for very large pots, which I no longer cook with now. Hard to tell by photos how deep or large the spoon area is. Not what I was expecting. I wanted opposite...shorter handle and deeper, larger bowl to the spoon. Seems like a well made utensil so will keep as a spare and order another one to see if I can eventually get the size I want. Again, the item is just fine; just not what I wanted."
"For young, middle aged (mine) and senior hands, nothing is as well designed and made than OXO Good Grips products for the kitchen. My last pasta server was a rather small traditional white plastic molded gismo that became brittle over time and the tines began to break off in our food! The handle was flimsy and awkward in my hand and did not really scoop enough pasta. The OXO Good Grips Spaghetti server is wider to scoop plenty of pasta in one swoop and the sturdy but soft grip is so easy on the hand. This is a wonderful product and I think others will agree. Lisa - Las Vegas, NV"
"Got this and it completely elevated my mashEd potato games! Gone are the days where I had to mash my potatoes with a fork. Can you imagine how tedious and long mashing potatoes used to take me? The worst part is that after spending 20 minutes trying to mash 2 potatoes, there will still be uneven chunks in my mashed potatoes. This potato masher cuts my potato mashing time down by at least 75%. Yes, I can mash my potatoes in 5 minutes now and the finished products is just so fluffy. Love this product!"
I've got 2 of these spoons already but it seems like I can never find a clean one when I need one so three is the magic number for me! I LOVE everything OXO. Price isn't as important as the way these products feel in your hand & the ease at which they can be hand washed. I wash them by hand. They're the perfect size for cooking.
"I'm a little picky about kitchen utensils so I bought this one to test out the brand. I am happy with my purchase. It works well, handle has not melted (I tend to forget utensils in the pots at times) and cleans up easily. It also has not scratched any of my nonstick cookware. Also happy with the length of the spoon itself as some brands have been weirdly short and I don't want my hand directly in a hot pan. Good buy, will be getting more from this line for sure."
Exactly what I wanted sturdy enough to flip quesadillas as I put in my photos but also deep enough to reach into it a lasagna or casserole as it‚Äôs advertise for. Really like the look simple and sleek. Easy to clean as well.
"& this one fit the bill! We moved into a new home about 6 months ago & I seem to have misplaced my old ladle during the transition. Every time I cooked soup or something really saucy I thought to myself ‚ÄúDang it, I forgot to buy one at the store again!‚Äù (Go figure) So I finally got an amazon and bought this one! I liked the price and it works just great! This is all you really need, and I don‚Äôt see why I would need a fancier, more expensive one."
"I had leftover broiled salmon and decided to make fish cakes with it. The basic recipe is, for 1.25 lbs of meat, a half cup each of chopped onion, cooked to they're soft, fresh bread crumbs and chopped parsley; salt and pepper; and to hold it all together, a raw egg. You want to use as gentle a hand as you can to form the fish cakes. The cakes should be just holding their shapes. So I formed the cakes on a small cutting board and decided to use the new spatula to (a) transfer the fish cakes from the board to a butter-oil combination that looked to be just right in the pan; and (b) turn the cakes over half way through the cooking (three minutes per side).  You can guess from the five stars, the Oxo spatula did a fine job. These are delicate fish cakes, and it's not uncommon for them to fall apart during cooking. A crude-edged spatula can make a mess of things. For me, cooking fish cakes, the edge was fine enough to do a stellar job, as good a job as the small metal spatula that I use for very gentle turning."
"Both sides of our families like potatoes. I bought this one whe the cheaper one I had snapped on Thanksgiving. When you hold the masher it feels substantial, but not heavy and uncomfortable. I like that it is not metal so that we can mashed potatoes right in the pressure cooker (doesnt scratch). I wish I had this masher years ago."
"As usual with OXO products, it‚Äôs an excellent product. An important feature for me is that the handle is long enough to dip to bottom of large stock pot that I use to make large quantities of soups and chili yet isn‚Äôt so long that‚Äôs awkward to use with other larger pots and much smaller ones. It‚Äôs been washed in dishwasher a half dozen times now and looks as good as new. If you are looking for a sturdy, practical, easy to clean ladle, I highly recommend."
"This is nice and FLAT. You can actually use it for fried eggs and omelettes. It cleans well. Yeah, gunk gets stuck on the edge. It‚Äôs NYLON. That HAPPENS‚Ä¶you scrape the edge off on the edge of the skillet and you will be fine. Do NOT leave this in your pan while your pan while the burner is still on. You will get melty-melty. The turner is NYLON. DON‚ÄôT DO IT. Be good to your turner. Also: you don‚Äôt need to crank up the heat to high. Most chefs say to use medium to low, and if you have a good pan, it will heat up just as fast."
We love this brand and have good luck with most of their products. We don't mind paying a little more for the piece of mind that a product will function well and be easier to use or at least more comfortable and easy to hold onto. The spoon is a great size and does the job. It is nothing fancy but it is a spoon so I don't expect fancy. The handle has a nice grip to it.
"I've been on the hunt for quite some time for a cooking spatula that has a flat end. I ordered this with high expectations that it would replace an older, smaller version that is on it's last bit of usefulness. This spatula is great! Nice, flat end makes breaking up hamburger meat in the pan just as easily as my old favorite one. Love this one is way bigger and is quite sturdy. The holes are a bonus in that I don't have to worry much about the hamburger grease as I'm browning it in the pan. I've only used this for hamburger cooking thus far, but I am definitely going to order a couple more!"
"You know how waffles sometimes cling to the iron and by the time you get them out they've broken into many pieces? This fork fixes that condition (and it's why I bought it). Run one of the tines along an edge or two of a sticking waffle and then poke it into an edge just a little and lift gently and the waffle will come out in one piece. And, added bonus, because the fork is nylon there's no damage to the surface of the waffle iron."
"I've been using plastic cooking spoons, etc for a long time, because I don't want to scratch my pots and pans. So, I expected this to be the same bendy material that all my previous ones have been, destined only to eventually be melted by my husband when he forgets to take it out of the pan during his rare cooking efforts. But not so with this one! This is a super sturdy material that still doesn't scratch the pans. I really enjoy these, and will absolutely stick to this brand in the future."
"This OXO cooking fork is just what I was looking. It is getting used primarily for scrambling eggs. The durable nylon is sturdy, easy to hold and a nice length to cook with and mix with. It has held up well through multiple dishwasher cycles as well. I have used this for plenty of other things in the kitchen and would recommend this for just about anything you‚Äôd want to use a cooking fork for, with maybe the exception of BBQing or flipping a 2+ pound steak."
"I really never thought I‚Äôd be reviewing a potato masher yet here we are. Adulting is fun, isn‚Äôt it?! But seriously, this works so effortlessly it really is great. It‚Äôs much better than the kind with the grid/ holes."
"I like the handle on this ladle -- it's not bulky and rubbery like a lot of other ladle handles out there, so it fits well in the kitchen utensil container. It's also a sleek & good looking handle design.  The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to a personal preference. The spoony part of the ladle is shallower than I prefer -- this ladle holds a 1/2 cup, when the farberware ladle I have (and like) has a 2/3 cup capacity.  1/19/2015 UPDATE: There's virtually no signs of wear on this ladle, after almost 2 years. That deserves an upgrade to 5 stars, in my book. (I like it enough to buy another one on clearance from Sears for $4.50)."
"I have to hand wash this tool so it doesn't gray over time with the enzymes in the dishwasher's soap. I have used it for years for spaghetti and getting boiled potatoes out of a pot. **** I bought a second one for my toiletries--I found it is an excellent back scratcher with rounded prongs, so it doesn't dig into my skin. Weird, but it is a great scratcher for the back's hard to reach areas!"
"Well, I've been looking for a spatula that was solid and not with the slits in it. they are hard to find. so I thought I would try oxo's since I love most of their products. These are really nice. Sturdy, easy to hold and I do have to say I haven't used them yet, but I'm sure they will work fine. If not I will rewrite my review."
"So far, I have used this to saut√© onions, flip fried eggs, & make burgers. I liked this square one so much, not only did I buy an extra but also bought the round one which is great for flipping pancakes, English muffins & shoveling cookies off the sheet. I have had NO problem with any sort of melting at all. However, I NEVER leave my spatulas resting in a hot pan, nor do I scrape the bottom of my pan with the edge of the spatula. I love that it does not have a weird, severe angle to the handle. It is relatively straight. It is lightweight but sturdy."
"As usual, oxo provides another great product. I needed a masher to use with my new nonstick cookware! This product fit the bill perfectly. Mashes up potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, cauliflower with ease! Easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I seem to be always happy with oxo products! Also, I thought it was a great price!"
I use this here ladle to scoop up my delicious fish skin soup. This ladle is good at trapping all the fish scales so you get plenty in your bowl. It works good for smacking people on the back of the head too! It gives a nice rebound feel to a quick rap on the noggin. I highly recommend this ladle it‚Äôs sturdy and rugged it serves your soup and smacks those that ridicule your good cooking!
This masher is great for whatever needs mashing and it is so easy to clean with just a quick rinse when you are done with using it. It's sturdy and fits well in your hand. its heat resistant plastic so you can use it with non stick pans without fear of scratching them. well worth its price. Well done OXO!
"It does not flex, which i really appreciate. And the edge is sharp (for a spatula) and cuts through lasagna or whatever with ease. When I held it in my hand it was larger and more substantial than I expected, but turns out, it's the perfect size. Been using it almost nonstop since it arrived. I love this item and all the oxo good grips utensils from this set (the ones having same handles). Of course do not cook with this, use the regular shaped spatulas instead."
""
"Does its job well; easily scoops out strands of long pasta. (I‚Äôve never tried it with smaller pasta noodles.) I gave 4/5 for sturdiness because if you scoop a lot, you can feel some flex. But it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôll break, and in every other regard, it‚Äôs 5/5. Cook‚Äôs Illustrated gave this pasta server the win in their testing."
This is my go to everyday spatula. It feels so comfortable in the hand. It has a nice flat edge which makes breaking up previously frozen minced meat super easy. It's not too narrow and not too wide. It washes well either by hand or in the dishwasher. I personally use it so often I end up washing it by hand. It's sturdy and well made as most OXO products are. I highly recommend this spatula.
This is a little bulkier than I expected but maybe that's the nature of potato mashers? I decided to go with nylon rather than metal hoping it will hold up better. I have a set of OXO spatulas I really like and this doesn't disappoint either--very sturdy and nice quality.
"This is a good sized spatula for flipping eggs, hamburgers, serving hot dishes. I love the many holes that strain juices a bit before plating. You don't want to leave this in a hot pan, but if used quickly for flipping, stirring and such, it will not melt from the hot food."
We recently started doing one of those weekly meal services and I needed a hand mashed for mashed potatoes. I picked this one because it was plastic and felt it would be safer on my non-stick pan than the metal ones. It works great. Super easy to clean as I just put in the dishwasher.
"I didn't realize how much I needed a ladle until my old one bit the dust. OXO products never disappoint, so finding this one at such a great price I hopped on it. it's solid (all one piece) with no obscure seams and the perfect length -- especially for avid Instant Pot users."
"My old ladle that I had used for many years broke recently and I had to buy another. I purchased a metal one that I thought would be sturdier and last longer than the old plastic one, but the quality isn't what I had hoped for and it isn't good for scraping along the bottom of pots. So, I returned to my old faithful in kitchenware - Oxo - and realized that I should have stuck with them in the first place. Even though it is made of plastic, it is very sturdy and well-made and should last for many years. I have never purchased an Oxo product that I didn't like."
"The plastic is not heat resistant. See the attached photos.  I bought one and liked the feel and overall design. So, I bought 2 more. Everything else seemed to be going to silicone, which doesn't work well as a spatula because they are either too thick and push the food around or are too thin and flimsy. I specifically bought this because it was ""old school"". Unfortunately, this one didn't hold up. It remains to be seen if the other 2 will hold up. They haven't melted yet. But, I am pretty sure they will now.  These melted areas didn't occur due to abuse. They just started appearing. What I mean, I didn't do anything that should have caused this. All I used it for was to turn eggs. I normally have good luck with OXO products. They dropped the ball on this product."
"Needed ladle for ages, just kept not finding good ones. Found this and for as little as it cost have been very impressed by it. It‚Äôs well balanced, sturdy, handles heat well, so easy to clean. Buying a few more for kitchen gift baskets."
"The thing I love is being able to use a masher in my non-stick pots without a care. This thing hasn't melted, warped, or had any issues in the year or so I've had it. It doesn't cause any kind of damage or marks on my pans. It does a thorough job of mashing and is easy to hold/use."
"There's nothing negative about this ladle. I use it with my stainless steel soup pot. No parts or pieces to come apart, nothing to rust or leak. Washes up fast. The bowl part holds just a little under a half cup. I use several OXO kitchen items and they're all quality pieces."
"I‚Äôve used one of these for years and wanted to buy a second one but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere . Finally found it on Amazon. I like the round holes - they drain easily and food doesn‚Äôt fall through like can happen on slotted spatulas. Dishwasher safe, sturdy, safe for nonstick pans. Glad I now have a spare one."
Most spatulas have a flexibility to them. Been looking for a while now to find a sturdy one with no give. This one is perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend.
"I needed a flipper for eggs and stuff since buying quality pots and pans and not wanting to scratch them up with my metal flippers. This does a good enough job. It's plastic though so it's definitely not as thin or as good as metal but of the plastic spatulas I've bought, this is by far the best of them. It's thin enough for most everything. Some items require a little but of work and being careful but it does the job. It's really nice quality and hasn't melted or warped yet."
"I liked the square turner so well that I bought TWO of them. I bought this one for removing large gingerbread man cookies off the baking sheet. I find them heat resistant -- to a point. They are best for quickly flipping things but NOT good for continual scraping back & forth on the bottom of a hot pan, nor leaving them resting IN nor on the side of, a hot pan."
"I love this ladle. The handle is very long, I can reach into my very deep stock pot easily. I was worried there would be a lot of bending with the long handle, but it's very sturdy! Good ladle capacity and you can just throw it in the dishwasher!"
"It's a ladle not the cure for cancer but it's a nice ladle. The angle on the handle and the bowl is much more comfortable for me to use than a standard 90¬∞ ladle. The materials are sturdy. I can honestly say this is the best ladle I have used. After using this, my other ladles went in the trash."
"This purchase experience was very Good! The item shipped quickly, it was packaged professionally. The item is very versatile, useful, easy to handle, washes well, turns food beautifully. It is of professional grade like the Chefs use. I will be ordering more for my family members. I love this product, the price was great the value. You will definitely get your money worth with this item. It looks good, it feels good in the hand and it is very attractive in the kitchen."
I gave this 5 stars because it is a well built functional cooking fork. I chose to return mine because I needed a fork with sharper tines. Oxo was very responsive and returned my money instantly with no fuss. I enjoy purchasing products from a company who values their customers.
"pretty straightforward- we needed a big spoon to cook with, and OXO makes very well designed tools for the kitchen. as it is with all their other products, this is well designed, well made, and i'm happy with the purchase. you will be too. obviously if you're working with very hot foods, consider a wooden spoon. Nylon is still nylon and can melt if you're subjecting it to high heat."
"I bought my sister a set of pots and pan several years ago and it comes with a black turner for her non stick pan. After using it a couple of times, she told me her spatula is melting. So here I am buying another turner for her to replace the garbage ones that she have. I owned two of this turner and have been using it a lot over the years. It is still as good as of today. I highly recommend it. I vouch for it's durability and performace. The price is very affordable. You can't go wrong with OXO product."
I admit I am hard on my utensils. This one has just the right amount of flex to break up clumps of hamburger. I clean it in my dishwasher and use it daily in my non-stick skillets.
"Our favorite cooking spoons finally gave out after 15+ years, and we were not able to find others with the right shape and size to the bowl in the spoon, a good handle, and durability. Wooden spoons sound nice, but they are really hard to get clean enough and they are not durable when used for braising, etc. I really like Tovolo's silicone spatulas and spoons for cooking in high heat, but they can't have the thin structure and shape of a good spoon.  I saw one of these in Target and the shape was perfect. I took it home and tried it and it was great for cooking a stew, then a good soup. Absolutely perfect, for stirring and dishing out. Every OXO Good Grips utensil we have purchased was well designed for ergonomics and ease of cleaning; this one is too. I ordered several from Amazon."
Silicon turners separate at the shank inside the base. After I threw away several silicon I retuned to hard nylon material. This is perfect for anything that requires a turner. I may need a second to replace one falling apart.

I love these utensils. I have a variety of Oxo utensils that I have for last 20 years. They are well made. I cook and bake a lot. These are great because I love that fact they are stainless steel with a nice grip. Easy to wash by putting them into the dishwasher. Great gifts for family and friends.
"I was tired of the flimsy spatulas I'd purchased from other stores. They bend, they rust & eventually they separate from their handle. I didn't want to pay more for a spatula but in the end it's actually worth it. I went with OXO because everything else I've ever owned from them has always been high quality & lasts a long time. This spatula is solid. I can't ever imagine it bending. I liked it so much that I bought another one. They'll probably last me a lifetime."
"We spent A LONG time looking for an agreeable ladle. I'm trying to weed the plastic out of our lives, so went looking for a metal ladle. It's a good argument that an all metal handle could get hot. We looked in SO many stores and they were sharp, or the angle stunk, or they didn't have the little pour spouts, or were all metal or all plastic. I'm not fond of buying without touching but we were at our wits' end and so I had seen this brand in the MANY stores in which we searched and knew that this company made sturdy product (just hadn't seen a ladle!). Worth the risk. It's pretty straight and as folks on the shorter side, it's not as easy to handle as one with a slight angle to it... but for what we got it's a great product. (I won't take stars just because we're not tall!)"
"I am left handed and have arthritis in both hands so this is perfect for me. The double pour spouts show consideration for lefties, the handle and balance are good for arthritisies."
I have bought several ladle's and darn if they didn't get rust on them and No they weren't cheap. They just don't make things like they once did and most things come from China. This is a nice size and NO RUST after washing!
"Bought this one and I wish I had sooner. Good weight, easy to use and it's not likely to fall apart. I just have to be mindful of not scraping any of my good pan surfaces. I'd had a plastic canning ladle for a couple years (the red and white one you can find on Amazon) but it cracked fairly early on at the join of the two parts. I put up with it a good long while because I'm stubborn, but eventually it had to go."
I am not sure exactly how to rate a turner because they all seem alike. The thing that stands out on this one is the price. I have a stainless steel indoor griddle and constantly have dirty turners so I bought these to make sure that one is always clean. It serves the purpose and is holding up to constant use and dishwasher cleaning.
"I tried to buy a cheaper one of these and after spending lots of time looking around (wasted time) I got what I thought would be great but wasn't! This one was reviewed by the cooking show as their favorite (I knew it, and still blew it!) I got this one because I still really needed one for canning. I was tired of dipping my hot jams our with a cup and spilling all over. This one is nice looking enough to use for daily service and also built so it has smooth surfaces and it easily cleaned. I am sure will last for years longer then I will! Do yourself a favor and just get this one first!"
"Never thought I would say I love a ladle.... but I love this thing! I bought it because I make hard tack rock candy and I bought silicone molds to pour the candy into the mold. This ladle is so frigging awesome! It is extremely sturdy, i know it withstands at least 300 degree temps. I love how the spout is on both sides. I could pour out of the other side without burning myself. It is large and holds a lot of candy. This is a lifesaver!"
"I bought these to replace a missing old echo carving fork. These carving forks are not just for carving, but are also great for turning meat over in the frying pan. Also used to flip a roast in the oven."
Not sure why it was so hard to find a decent ladle. Wasn't sure about this funky design when i first saw it but wow---works so much better than other ladles we have had. Plus it's super sturdy. Imagine it's indestructible. Feels great in the hand. Another great design and quality product from oxo. '
The spatula is comfortable to hold. It's thin enough on the end to get under whatever you want to flip easily (including pancakes). It is flat across the end (not rounded like some) so it works great for chopping up burger when you are frying it up. It was more expensive than many spatulas but I believe it was worth the extra cost.
"I had purchased OXO stell turner years ago and loved it. I still have it. So I purchased this one for a friend who had been using a cheap spatula that really could turn anything substantial. This spatula has a big steel head that easily turns pancakes, hamburgers or anything else that you are cooking."
"I've been looking for a new spatula for a long time, but when I come across one in a store, they all seem to be ultra-flexible, which wasn't what I wanted. A few reviews of this one said they were stiff, so I thought I'd take a chance on it. And yay!, it is stiff! Just what we wanted! Will buy another!"
"I hesitated buying this bc the price made it seem like a ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù deal. But this is a very sturdy, nicely made product. I use it mostly when I‚Äôm using my cast iron cookware and I love the long padded handle. It‚Äôs easy to hold & the length prevents me from getting splattered by hot foods. Liked it so much I bought a second one as a gift."
"I was lucky to find this that is long enough, sturdy and the correct angle for me. I will be buying a couple more so they will last the rest of my life time. You dont know how long I have been shopping to find a good one."
"I‚Äôve had an old fashioned soup ladle that was always awkward to use, but not bad enough to replace. Then a friend sent me this one and it‚Äôs a wow. The spout is perfect for a right hander and it‚Äôs so sturdy and one ladleful is almost one soup serving."
"Needed a new spatula, whoopie. This one is good though. Very sturdy. It's not super long, so it fits in a drawer well, but long enough to flip a burger on the grill. OXO makes quality products and this is certainly one of them."
I bought it to help scoop stews and soups out of my pressure cooker and transfer them to serving bowls or storage containers. It's very easy to use and it can pour easily out of the spout on either side of the ladle's bowl..
"Whenever I need a kitchen gadget, I look for the OXO brand first. I've never been disappointed! So recently when I could not find the old kitchen ladel anywhere, I jumped on the opportunity to get this one! And it's awesome for ladeling soup. In fact, I think I'll go have some soup right now, just for the chance to use this fine OXO product."
The best spatula I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶
We needed a large fork to hold the turkey while carving with an electric knife. This met the requirement.
Needed to replace a meat fork that broke. This one is excellent .
"Excellent quality. I would buy again, but given it's build quality I don't think that will be necessary for a long time."
"This is just the right length and a very good weight for stirring heavier meals like goulash, etc., that I make in Dutch ovens frequently. I love this spoon and grab it first."
"This is a basic, sturdy ladle that is strong and cleans up well. Contrary to the others I've purchased, this one cleans easily and food doesn't stick to it like the plastic ones. Very happy with this purchase!"
"As I've upgraded or replaced old kitchen tools, I have exclusively bought OXO brand items because they are always good. This is no exception. It is big, sturdy and very well made. I'm thrilled with my new soup ladle and will continue to buy OXO products."
"I am left handed and often have a difficult time using most ladles, as they only have a pouring spout on one side. This one is perfect for every family member since it can easily be used with either hand!"
Just got this soup ladle today. I already love it and have not used it yet. Comfortable to hold. Sturdy. Nice looking. Nice stainless steel. Great for left and right handed people. Highly recommend it. The ladle size. Thank you
"I had a ladle melt the other day, ruining my dish. This metal ladle was my response to that melting episode, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  Would recommend!"
Good quality well made ladle for a good price. Like the large bowl on this ladle and the long handle which is excellent for scooping into large soup pots.
"I love it and I am sure that it will last me a long time! Everyone should have this in their kitchen, makes serving certain dishes a bit easier"
Everything about it is great especially digging out noodles that like to sink and stay at the bottom of the pot of soup. LOL!
"The metal used in the construction of this ladle is actual steel. I use a magnetic utensil holder and this thing sticks to it like glue! Other, cheaper and thinner ladles are made of something else but it is not steel. I have only washed this item in my dishwasher twice but I suspect it will hold up well over time."
"I love all OXO products! This is by far my favorite set of cooking utensils. I had the silicone set and enjoyed using those, until I upgraded to this stainless steel set. These IMO are much better to cook with. The stainless steel utensils clean so much easier. These are very sturdy and are also a joy to cook with."
"Sturdy, attractive and well made. I only purchase OXO as they wash well - dishwasher too. Last forever."
"This is a great little meat fork. Decently long tines, sharp enough to easily pierce even a tough cut of meat. The ridges in the handle make it easy to hang on to even if your hands get greasy. I also love that you just throw it in the dishwasher for cleaning."
"I have missed having a sturdy ladle. I have broken so many nylon or plastic ladles by using them for soup, gravy or sauces. I think for the price this is one of the better ladles on the market."
"Like everything that OXO makes, this is a high quality item that will last forever. A proud addition to any kitchen."
"The ladle is a generously sized, sturdy, and has pouring spouts on both sides of the bowl. Works great for either right- or left-handed users."
My old ladle gave me a burn on my hand...so I got the OXO ladle asap. Now it works even better than any ladle iv ever used. Good for pouring for lefties too. Nice padded handle...no more burned hands!
"This is a wonderful spatula. Heavy duty, well made, and quite sturdy. Definitely recommend."
I like that the metal is all one piece so no fasteners are required- makes it more sturdy and easy to clean
Exactly how I wanted it to be. Goid quality. Sturdy and easy to clean.
This flipper/turner is great. Works very well on everything so far. Cleans up easy and is sturdy.
The ladle was designed well! It has a long handle for deep soup pots and it‚Äôs very sturdy. I broke my other plastic ladle and ordered this one - I am glad I did! This one will be around forever! Easy clean-up! Highly recommend!
I had to replace a slotted spoon that was passed down. It had rusted. This spoon is a great replacement. I hope it lasts as long.
"This ladle is one piece of metal--not grommets or seams to loosen or rust. Well made again, OXO. And it's almost twice the size as our previous ladle."
"Fantastic fork. Sharp, sturdy and just the right length. Perfect for lifting roasts out of the pan and onto serving vessel. Great when carving."
I had been looking for a spatula to take camping for our grill. My husband didn't like the large ones made specifically foe grills. This one works great and doesn't take up as much room.
Exactly as described and can be used for other sauses as well. Clean up & time saver!
This is a good spoon for cooking lots of dishes.
Only serving fork that DOESN'T slip out of my arthritic hand! Excellent tool.
I like this flipper a lot. It feels good in the hand and things like eggs don't seem to slide off. It has a good angle.
"Like the thin edge, the grip, the sturdiness and quality."
I needed to replace a basting spoon with sturdier material between the handle and the blade. This was it. I hope it lasts.
"I can't believe I am so excited about this turner, but it's awesome."
Lightweight but very strong. Nice balance between handle and tines.
OXO has never disappointed me with their tools. This spatula works very well for the cast iron skillet that needed the right tool for flipping.
"Fork is very sturdy, fits my hand with confidence, and looks great!"
Another excellent product from Oxo Good Grips
Just what I have been searching for. Would have liked the handle to be a bit shorter but this spatula works just like I needed it to.
"I'd been searching for a good quality, strong and easy to clean cooking/turning fork and this one fits the bill to a T. Good product!"
My new go to ladle. Oxo delivers again.
Well made construction. Solid. All I need for the grill. Easy to clean
This is a sturdy ladle and I like the size of this. A couple of scoops and your bowl is full. I would purchase again.
"It was exactly what I was looking for. Good size, sturdy and easy to hold"
"What can you really say about a ladle other than it's sturdy, cleans well, and helps me live my best soup life."
"Me encant√≥, excelente calidad."
Very sturdy.
"A++++ Firm, sturdy, and easy to clean. That‚Äôs all I needed. Also something large, for bigger dishes (i.e. pizza/ lasagna). Served it‚Äôs purpose. I‚Äôm sure you could find cheaper options, but from my experience, you get what you pay for."
"Finally, a spatula edge that does not disintegrate when it gets hot. You can still get it underneath an egg to turn it..."
"For the price, I would not have expected this good of quality. It's really a nice set."
They work great and clean up nice and aren‚Äôt to big
Great quality for the price.
So fancy and work great!
Surprising level of quality for the price!
Sturdy
works good while cooking
Very good
"The mini spatulas are surprisingly very useful--I thought I was just going to donate them. The four larger pieces seemed like a good enough value to order this set.  Fit and finish was not impressive out of the package. But after a few weeks of use, everything has held up well to cooking and the dishwasher. And again, I've already used the mini spatulas many many times. I had to lightly peel remnants of silicone from most of the spatulas after unboxing. The remnants were barely attached scraps from molding of the spatulas. No evidence these scraps existed after the first run through the dishwasher. This is a no name brand but so far comparable to other tools as offered by brands like OXO."
the one-piece design makes these spatulas super easy to use and clean. I didn't know how many uses I would find for the difference sizes until I had them. I would recommend to anyone who cooks a lot.
"I don‚Äôt know why they are called spatulas,the biggest one is shaped like a spoon and the largest flat one is petty sad. I would return but probably make stocking stuffers.Merry Christmas"
"Forc Silicone Spatula Set is absolutely perfect; materials, usability, multiples and performance. They just endured a marathon prep session and we have nothing but praise (still three unused!). All of the pieces are substantial; obviously created with adult cooks in mind. The edges are thin enough to scrape residue off our baking mat without force or damage to the mat. Major plus: Nonstick- all pieces clean up easily. Perfection."
"I like that these are one piece, they are not very firm though, so scraping a side of a bowl is difficult because the spatula just bends over the frosting or whatever you are mixing."
I love these spatulas because they are one piece and easy to clean. No more food stuck in crevices. They are very strong yet flexible. And the variety of sizes is great. They did not come with the Forc name on them so not sure if they are genuine but they are great nevertheless.
"These are sturdy and comfortable to use, with a size/shape for most purposes. I find myself reaching for them more and more often above my older ones, and I'm using ones I didn't think I'd use as much. These are a great bargain."
These are very sturdy and the length and size of them are good. I‚Äôm a man with large hands and these are very well sized. There is a assortment of sizes and lengths for every use. From small bottles and jars to large mixing bowls. I think they are just great.
These are nice sturdy spatulas for a good price. I like all the different sizes for different applications. I got the red color and it looks great. So far they are holding up nicely.
I am returning these. They are far too big and clunky for my pans and they feel heavy in my hands. And I‚Äôm not sure one of the pieces won‚Äôt scratch my nonstick pans.
"they are too small and very flimsy looking. A regular spatula is about 3"" wide. The largest of these are 2"". The tinny things - some are 1/4"" wide - must be for arts and craft. I couldn't find use for them..."
I love to bake. These silicone tools helped make that job easier! I ordered this set for the mini tools and have yet to use them!
"SHIESTER!!! bad product that breaks in less thatn 2 months. but i cant return????? thanks for stealing my money,."
I don't use all of them and as I am curious as to what to do with some of them but I reach for them all of the time. I love them and they clean so easily!
"I washed them upon receipt, and have only used 1 so far. Worked fine. Washed easily."
"Awesome combination of pieces. Makes life in the Kitchen so much easier. Throw away the old wooden spoons. These are my new, go-to cooking utensils!"
The smaller ones started to melt. The pan was on a LOW burner & I was stirring. It wasn't even high heat or just left sitting. I don't believe the small ones are really silicon probably just basic plastic. The larger ones have worked okay so far.
"Just what I needed, small ones for the coffee grinder. All others replace the overheated bent ones."
Like that it is one molded piece and food doesn‚Äôt get stuck in the groves
I'm 69 yrs old and have used alot of different spatulas in my time but these spatulas are the BEST EVER!!
"These arrived exactly as described with no missing items and they work as expected. In short, no surprises and no regrets."
"This is a perfect set of spatulas, extremely sturdy and a size for each need. The wife loves them!"
Very good quality.
"I use these things all of the time, live them."
small ones are very small and you dont need this many smalls
The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it shows a bit of a white film from running in dishwasher
I absolutely love these and especially all the sizes that come together. I've used them almost daily.
"These are great. Bought 2 months ago, holding up to daily use/dishwasher cycles"
I like the size of all the pieces. Especially the thin ones to get into small bottle opening. And I use the small thin ones for my face cream jars.
Have only used 1 spatula so far & it was sturdy and easy to clean. I'm looking forward to using the jar spatulas to see how effective they are to use. I like to get every drop out of a product given the price of merchandise.
Great product and very happy with it. Fast shipping and great company!!!!
Different sizes. One for almost any size jar.
I really like this set! It has a spatula for every need! They are very sturdy and heat resistant. Also they are all one piece so they are very easy to clean.
Slightly disappointed as actual spatula's that we needed are not part of the package we received.
The spatulas are a little flimsy making it hard to stir heavier foods.
"They are the best! They are made very well. Easy to work with, especially because they gone in different sizes."
Perfect !
Works great and love the different sizes
Just what I needed for my non stick pots and pans.
I have not use that much yet
This set is so nice. I love it!
Love them. I would suggest these.
Great utensils especially for baking.
Perfect for my needs! Easy clean up and great quality!
Really sturdy
Purchased in August 2021 and the small spatula fell apart December 2021
Love the durability and different sizes
Very versatile and useful! Niw I can get every last bit of Dijon out of the jar!
"Why should I rate for an item that I didn't receive. I received the Crystals for Beginners book, nothing else."
Love these medium hard rubber spatchulas! I would buy them again or for a present!
Very well put together but for me items were too heavy. Sounds weird but when you get older ones hands don't have the strength.
Great spatula set. If I needed more I would buy them again.
Right for the price.
The product quality is better than my expiration
Long spatula to clean jars
Not impressed
The silicon spatulas are to thick and the bigger one is totally not useful for me
Items were much larger than anticipated. I will be returning
This product arrived with water inside the packaging. Gross.
"I mean, what's there to say about a silicone spatula? It's one of my most used kitchen tools, safe for all cookware, heat resistant, and great for scooping every last bit of a sauce or batter out of a bowl, making clean-up easier and ensuring there is no waste. There's nothing not to like. They are easily my most used tool and I especially like the small ones, they are just so handy. I already have a few in other colors but over time the pastel versions tend to get discolored which is not an issue with the black ones! Great value getting 4 in a pack, I took 2 to my office and kept 2 at home."
I really enjoy using these spatulas. It did take a little bit to get use to how sturdy they are. Because they in one piece they do not bend as easy as traditional spatulas. Once you get use to them they are wonderful.
"Perfect sizes for bigger jobs and smaller tasks, great one piece construction. great to just throw in the dishwasher and replace the spatulas I had that had wooden handles that I couldn't do that with. Will definitely buy again when these wear out."
These spatulas made outstanding replacements to one's we had for years. The single piece construction is really nice- no handles popping off when you stir or scrape something thick!
Love the mini spatulas! I have 2 others (di oro and Sweese). These are in between those others- softer and thinner than di oro but sturdier than Sweese. I usually use these to scrap the bowl clean and they work very well. Haven‚Äôt cooked with them yet. Very affordable too!
I bought two sets one for my sister and one for me and we use them every day. We are both cooks and these fit into our arsenal of must have cooking utensils
These are great if you're looking to have clean cookware. Spatulas that have 2 separate pieces get grungy quickly. I don't want to have any hiding places for bacteria & mold. These are very pliable one-piece silicone spatulas that are comfortable and nice looking next to all my other black pieces of cookware.
"Solid, weighted, good quality tools. A bit stiff for complete batter scraping. I use them for most duties in my non-stick cookware. I hand wash them, because my dishwasher leaves mineral spots on the black."
Great value! So far so good using with hot and cold items. With them being black there is no worry that some foods might stain them (as has happened with my white spatulas)
"Love the flexibility of these spatulas. Can clean out jars, scrape sides of pan and mix cake or cookie batter with ease."
I love that they are one piece! No more tops coming off or food getting stuck in the cracks. Various sizes are great and they‚Äôre very sturdy. Easy to clean.
So durable and flexible and heat does not phase these spatulas. Also great colors that don't fade with use.
Great quality and will enjoy using them for many years.
I am pleased with this purchase and will recommend to friends.
Spatulas are great. They‚Äôre actually better than the expensive Crate & Barrel versions.
These work very well for what I need. I like the one piece construction.
I love these!! No problems using hot or cold.
"Excellent product! Washes well, sturdy, durable"
Use it on my non stick pan. Good so far!
Glad to have purchased these!
These are bright and strong and versatile! Love being able to find them easily and they‚Äôre strong and can scrape the tough stuff. Love that there are two sizes.
Happy with product.
It's one piece. So when you're using or cleaning it the spatula end doesn't come off.
They are sturdy and the two sizes are good for a wide range of uses. Good price
Just as described.
Best ever love them all
Great product
Durable and flexible. Love these!
"These spatulas are a ""Must Have"" in my kitchen! I have replaced so many of them over the years due to them melting, falling apart or breaking. I finally found a set that can handle what they're supposed to do. They're not flimsy either. I could cut a cold, hard stick of real butter in half with ease and saut√© some veggies in a Wok. I used them to spread some icing on a dozen cupcakes too! Not to mention how easy it was to wash them. Unlike this name brand spatula included in my pictures. It can't be more than 4 months old and it's already coming apart. If you're a skeptic like me and unsure, I highly recommend them. I am very happy with their versatility."
Yeah very well made. Some of the best ones that I've used in some years. Nice to get a spatula that's got a lot of umph to it when you're working them hard. I don't believe the average homeowner could go wrong with a set of these Good design and well made.
"We've had these for a few months and use them daily. I ordered the set primarily for the two larger spatulas, but I've found I actually prefer the smaller ones for my scrambled eggs every morning. They still look brand new after daily use - no stains, misshaping, or any issues in the dishwasher. Great product!"
"These things are tiny. The little ones are hardly useful. And there are only 2 sizes. Not sure why you need 2 of each size... Unless you‚Äôre doing fine cake decorating, I‚Äôd look for a larger sparula"
"The best Spatulas I own! I am obsessed with these. They are amazingly heat resistant, I have mistakenly left one of these in a wok while stir frying some veggies and it didn‚Äôt melt or was hot to the touch when I finally realized and took it out. I wish there was a whole line of other kitchen utensils like these. I wish I could give this 10 stars."
"Compre dos pares, uno para m√≠ y mi t√≠a, el m√≠o la uso para sartenes antiadherente y no se han derretido funcionan de maravilla aunque me hubiera gustado que fuesen m√°s grande, no vi las medidas lo compre pq se puede utilizar para antiadherente ya que andaba buscando algo en madera. Con mi t√≠a ella la necesitaba para resposteria."
My only complaint is the end of the smaller spatulas is floppy and i have to change my grip lower when using it. Overall they are sturdy and stiff and highly recommended for the price.
What's not to like? These are essential in any kitchen. Since they're silicone they are heat resistant so they won't warp like cheap plastic when used in hot pans. They are sturdy. And the colors are cheerful. A+
This product is more so intended for baking mixing up batter/though but it isn‚Äôt sturdy enough it is too flimsy and bendable so if you have a super thick batter you‚Äôre going to be struggling because it has no resistance it doesn‚Äôt break but it‚Äôs hard to stir because it is just flimsy the handle has nothing hard inside of it to keep it sturdy
This was a inexpensive purchase. Product holds up nicely. Haven't stressed the heat resistance to the max but not an issue for using during stovetop cooking.
They were so inexpensive that I was skeptical about the quality but decided to try them. The quality is excellent and in fact of better quality than some that cost more. They're very sturdy.
Sturdy and holds up to heat while cooking. Love the smaller ones for scraping out that last bit of peanut butter in the jar :)
Very good spatulas are very sturdy and they aren't falling apart every 5 minutes
Sturdy but scraper part gives in the right way to scrape bowls clean!
"Bright colors, sturdy and work well."
I'm not really a cook but these set of spatulas can be handy when the need arises.
"These silicone spatulas are great. The different sizes make them versatile kitchen tools. They‚Äôre heat-resistant, and won‚Äôt scratch your pans."
These are durable and the different sizes allow for versatility of use. Fun colors too!
"I like the firmness, easy to clean."
Wish I‚Äôd had these years ago. Perfect sizes for all uses! Love these!
Looks good
I love these Spatulas. They're perfect and the price was good! I've used them with high heat and they're holding up great. They havent melted or deformed at all!
Just Awesome for my treat making business..
Great set of spatulas. I have been using them for a month and have no complaints. Saw a review about spots after dishwashing and I haven't had that problem. Highly recommend.
I likes
I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
The 2 bigger ones are just the right size the 2 smaller ones probably just suit for use like a spatula but they are quite sturdy
Great!
Great kitchen tool! No worries about melting. Not flimsy.
These are really nice spatulas. Love how heat resistant and sturdy they are. Happy with my purchase!
Use them daily.
"we like the way it feels in your hands, sturdy and up to the kob"
These are great! I'm so glad I purchased them.
Love my spatulas. Perfect for every last use!
"Love my newest s addition to my kitchen! I wish the smaller ones had a little longer handle and there were more color options, but luckily they worked well with my kitchen colors!"
My new favorite kitchen tool!
"Great quality, getting another set"
"Is as described I just thought would be flatter for like turning eggs, ect. This is not negative review, I just did not look closer at what I was ordering"
I only got three not 4
"I ordered 4, I only got the two large ones. 50% is a failing grade"
"These silicone spatulas are quite nice. They're rigid, but not hard. They're not flimsy. These work well for stirring in a hot pot because they won't melt. I stirred some spaghetti sauce, that I was thawing in a pot, w/the bigger size spatula. The sauce did not stain my spatula. I used the red one just in case, but there was no sign of staining. These also work well for folding/mixing, spreading, and of course scraping a bowl clean. I used the smaller size to mix up a batch of garlic butter. I spread the garlic butter onto the bread and then scraped the excess into a container for later use. I didn't notice any lingering garlic smell either. I washed them in my dishwasher. Overall I'm quite pleased w/this set of silicone spatulas."
"These are fairly soft and very flexible, perfect for most batters and doughs. These could be a little to soft for very heavy thick mixes. The handles are nice and stiff, they flex somewhat while I am using them but I really think they are about right.  I wish this set had 3 different sizes, it really needs a medium sized spatula instead of just small and large. Instead there are 2 small and 2 large. For us, 2 of these are either going to end up being a gift or pushed to the back of a drawer.  Overall these are good quality and if you need extra's this set could be perfect, if it was 1 small, 1 medium and 2 large this set would be ideal for a lot more kitchens. But the quality easily deserves 5 stars."
"Purchased these to use with a Camp Chef 600 outdoor griddle. They seem to be well made and sturdy. The largest and smallest spatulas have good cutting edges on the sides and end. The other spatula has a rounded end and a nice edge on it. There is a small amount of flex in them that feels as if it's just right for most uses. Handles are comfortable. The scraper has some interesting features. The bottom and one end have cutting edges. One side has length and depth in inches and the other side is centimeters. The centimeter side also has a cup measure equivalents chart on it from 1/16C to 1C to ounces,tablespoons, teaspoons and milliliters! Only really minor negative and it's really just my preference, I would have liked a hole in the scraper for hanging. Expect these to last a long time even with being store outside with griddle"
"I needed this since buying my flat, stove-top cast iron griddles for my home. These tools are amazing! The larger flat spatula is so perfect for my hashed browns, and the dough scraper is amazing for measuring out cuts and making perfect pizza dough; or, they are just fantastic for making the dough needed for my awesome sourdough bread!  10/10, and I'm going to have to find more by Anmarko, as the quality here is insurmountable! You will not be disappointed."
Ok so I don't usually leave reviews but the customer service that I was given was truly amazing. One of my spatulas came slightly bent (probably in transit) and I mentioned it to the company just for future precautions because I had already given them to my father in law as a birthday gift. They were so kind as to send me a new spatula even though I didn't ask them to. This was truly refreshing and I am very happy with this company. The other spatulas were very sturdy and great for the price. Would definitely recommend.
Nice quality for a new griddle range top! Very pleased!
"I must have ordered these in error. Was going to return them, but hubby saw them and said ""NO"". They're really nice. So we're keeping them."
"To be fair, I‚Äôve only used these half a dozen times but they are great! They feel like they‚Äôll hold up to many uses! I only use the scraper and the large spatula but it‚Äôs nice to have the others.  They make cleaning my flattop so simple and I feel like a line cook and it‚Äôs awesome! They wipe down super easy and make cooking a breeze. These are a must have if you have a camp chef or other brand griddle flat top!"
"The tools are much more robust than I expected for the price. Very strong and pretty comfortable to use. They've been a perfect companion to my new propane griddle. And the edges are unexpectedly sharp, which came in handy for chopping some veggies while they were cooking the other day. And when I'm done, I just toss them in the dishwasher and they're ready for next time. Great purchase, for sure."
"This is the best and handiest 4 piece set I've ever had. Appears to have excellent construction, flexibility just right and good weight. My 1st order arrived as an incorrect order and I emailed the seller and he immediately had a new set shipped to me and it all appeared to be no fault of his. This company does take care of their customers."
"Love these, it makes it so nice with the sharp edge all the way around, I could easily cut my chicken smaller right on the griddle, I like the hole in the handles for hanging too, very convenient tool in many ways!!"
Love using these at my griddle. Makes cooking easier.
Nothing not to like! It arrived earlier than expected. A very well made set of tools. They will last forever. Used them once already and they are perfect to use on the griddle. Couldn't be happier!!
Great ensemble of spatulas. High quality and now I have everything I need. Great choice for my outdoor cooking on my grill an stainless cook top!
What a great set like the qaulity great value for your dollar. Work great on my grill from breakfast to dinner meals would buy for a friend.
We got a Blackstone grill & use these on it. We love the set. We just finished cooking breakfast using them. They clean up nicely also
"I once had a lovely spatula from Pampered Chef, study, wonderful and easy to use. The handle somehow got bent in the oven....................so now I have these lovely spatulas!!!!!!!Highly recommend"
Easy to clean and they are very sturdy. They were also very sharp
Work very well on our new griddle. Designed so your hand doesnt het to close to the hot surface.
I really like the quality of each spatula as well as the variation of sizes.  Price point was good and delivery was quick.
I would buy them again
Great product for the price!
The large spatula allows me to turn heavier or multiple objects on the grill and the more agile narrow Hague spatula handles lighter items like eggs and fragile fish products easily. The scraper is rising enough to easily clean any flattop grill with ease. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe.
This product is just like described. I'm very happy with my purchase.
"Three out of the four spatulas/scraper have started to rust after less than two weeks of use. Always used indoors and washed immediately. One spatula (the shortest one) is particularly bad. Never left in water. If you want to keep these, make sure you wash and HAND dry immediately. Otherwise, they appear to rust from hand washing and rack drying (one was put in the dishwasher, but that one is still fine, besides these weird water spots I cannot seem to wipe or scrub off). Something is clearly wrong with the coating or the metal composition for it to rust so quickly and unevenly.  I do like the variety of sizes and they seem very sturdy. Handles seem fine and well-attached. I would have kept them except for the rusting. Really liked the bench scraper. Used that one a lot. It was the main reason I ordered the set. It has very handy markings on it which I used to measure my dough while rolling out. I am sad to return these."
"best product, easy to use, low value"
very good But be careful they cut!
Just got seems to be a nice set haven‚Äôt had a chance to use it yet
"These items are exactly what I ordered--they are heavy duty, well constructed, and should do very well in my restaurant environment."
"Nice & sturdy, great for cooking on a grill"
I was very happy with the quality of this set. Just what I was expecting.
Mainly I bought to use for giant pizza slices with a 16-inch pizza.
Very happy with these commercial grade spatulas
"Looking for a straight edged spatula? I got two here, not counting the straight chopper! Great plastic handles, too."
Used the utensils today and they were excellent.
Very sturdy set. Nicer than I even suspected.
I love the flex in the spatula and the quality in all the products. I feel like a chef in a 5 start restaurant.
This is a quality set of spatulas and great price.
Love this set
Excellent quality. Was very happy and using immediately
Great great great product love this product
Love them. Used them on my new Blue Rhino Flat top grill.
You will fee; like a chef using these spatulae.
"This set was a gift, to be used for a new griddle."
Excellent
As advertised.
Better than expected. No worries here.
Great set
"Great quality, great price!"
Works amazing for my cast iron!
Love this set.I put them to use the very same day they got delivered and the quality of the spatulas are great. I am glad that I purchased these.
Well made... good price
"These are as sturdy as I hoped they'd be. There is a time and a place for the thin, flexible spatula, and when when it's the wrong time and place, then these will do the trick."
"I just received and received them twice so, so far so good."
High quality
Great
Nothing
I have only used the set a couple times. It seems to be very well made and restaurant quality. I am very happy with my purchase!
works great and fun to use on a big flat top
"Very nice quality, handles feel good in your hand Looking forward to cooking with these"
I was expecting a professional grade set of kitchen tools...and that is exactly what I received.
Appears to be heavy duty and well made. Quality product. Only time will tell.
This product is everything it advertised it was. All pieces were sturdy and well-built. They delivered in a timely manner and I have no issues with them.
Great set for making tacos. Heavy duty durable metal spatulas.
"Great Griddle tools for the price!! Sturdy, sharp edges for scraping/chopping and mixing Delicious foods on your griddle and easy to clean! Make sure to dry them off, they will have small splotches of rust if you don‚Äôt take care of them! Otherwise, they are great! I use them everyday with zero problems the past month. Hope this helps!  PS: I‚Äôve now used them over a year and the tools work just as they did when I bought them. The plastic handles are still tightly bonded to the metal shanks of the tools. Tools will NOT rust is you keep them clean, dry then lightly oil them if not in use for two weeks or longer. This was a great purchase for the $$."
We really love these tools!!
Pretty great kitchen aid.
"I had ordered these to go along with my recently purchased Camp Chef Griddle for our camping trips. I've only used the largest spatula so far, but after using it this past weekend on our trip, I love it! I used it for cooking pancakes and eggs both mornings and hamburgers on the second night. The large spatula is a perfect fit and it works so well. After cooking I was able to use it to scrape off the leftover bits on the griddle before giving it a thorough cleaning. All the spatulas feel very durable and seem like they will hold up for quite awhile. Would definitely recommend!"
Sturdy and still flexible. Better than the Blackstone set which was too flexible.  Wider spatula is great.
I bought a set for me and my brother and we love them. They are great!!
This product is exactly as advertised.
Very impressed with the quality vs the cost.

"I needed a non-metallic spatula to saut√© mushrooms in a Teflon skillet. This was the cheapest high-temp set. The top utensil, which I call a 'spoon-atula', was perfect. It did not melt, and allowed me to flip or taste the mushroom pieces nicely. From the top of the photo, there is also a jar spatula (think mayonnaise), a mini-spatula, and a traditional spatula for scraping mixing bowls or whatever. I like the color, they are very flexible, durable, and won't melt."
"They have a sturdy interior - might be metal - so they don't overbend. They have just enough spring to clean a bowl well. They are heat resistant so I use one for sauteing in a fry pan. Nice color, not too big sizewise and I use them a lot. They go in the dishwasher with no problems"
""
"I love to cook and I love having nice things to cook with. After a short period of time, most of my spatula heads don‚Äôt stay on. So annoying. So my husband purchased these (because if the head falls off, it‚Äôs broken) and I love them so much! Great variety of sizes and shapes. It would be a great starter pack for someone just moving out into their own place."
"I recently bought this set of spatula and have absolutely fallen in love with them. They are durable, heat resistant up to 600 Fahrenheit, non-slippery, dishwasher safe, and the best part they do not retain odors or colors. They have good quality and come in the perfect size too.  I love getting in the kitchen with my kids and my toddler was my fascinated with this set as they are not as big and heavy as other spatulas from different brands we have around. Love the variety of colors offered! 10/10 recommended."
I own several ‚Äúname brand‚Äù spatulas but they are two separate pieces and food residue gets into the area where they are joined and it never looks completely clean. I haven‚Äôt owned these long enough to rate the durability but they seem to be very sturdy. I also like the different end shapes. Very satisfied with this purchase.
I've spent too many years melting cheaper spatulas. I suspect that these will last longer than I will ! One piece without joins or cracks to wonder what may be growing in there. These will last so long I consider them; GREEN (even though they are a pretty blue ; )
"The large one has a slight spoon shape, which is good for stirring pots. The long narrow one is good for jelly jars. and the others are good for mayonnaise jars. Super easy to clean."
They are phenomenal!! My mother got some and after using hers I hopped right on here and got some for myself! They are so easy to clean! And work great with all our pots and pans. No longer worried about scratching them. They are great! Will probably buy more as gifts throughout the years.
I like the size and how easy they are to work with because I have arthritic restrictions affecting my grip. Love the no slip handles and the heat resistance features. They mix cooking bowls/pots ingredients while you‚Äôre stirring things very well. Hated to give up my other spatulas but these have been a great replacement.
"I really was drawn to these spatulas because they are so heat resistant. I also really like the fact that the spatulas are easy to clean, and have a stainless steel ""spine"" inside the handle and part way into the spatula itself. I have always used wooden handle Rubbermaid spatulas, but they are not heat resistant and these are far superior to my old standbys!"
"Heat resistance, durability and just the right amount of flexibility allows for a wide variety of uses: scraping out cold and hot containers, frosting pastries and cakes, and stirring/folding in ingredients. Single piece structure eliminates crud build up at connecting points and the chance of separation. Easy to clean and sanitize; I put them in the dishwasher. The different shapes in this set cover all of my spatula needs‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt need 10 spatulas, but I do need a few different shapes. My only complaint is color. I wish they came in more subtle colors."
I like the fact that these spatulas are all one piece so there is no way for mold to form in the seams. I feel they are much more sanitary than the two piece. There are a variety of sizes to meet all my cooking needs.
Ordered to use just for baking and they work great. I worried the silicone would hold smells from the food they touched but these do not. They are a little shorter in length then I was expected but I should have looked at the measurements.
"This is my 2nd set, I use them for everything from baking to cooking. They are dishwasher safe but clean up easily. They're very sturdy but I like the flexibility over a wooden spoon. I would recommend them."
"My niece is an executive chef and she recommended these silicone spatulas. I ordered them and they are great! They are an excellent value, too! One of the things she liked about them was they are all one piece, so can be put in the dishwasher."
I used these to make chocolate pies which requires a very high temp. They were perfect. I love the color & it hasn‚Äôt faded. Easy to clean.
"I really like these. There are no nooks or crannies for ""icky"" stuff to accumulate. Easy to clean. They're a good size and very usable. I have purchased two colors. I would recommend!"
"Works great, easy to clean"
"I love this set! I am almost certain I haven‚Äôt gone a day without using them. I have had other silicone spatulas that inevitably have their heads come off. These are great. They go in the dishwasher, there‚Äôs no discoloration from tomato based sauces, and they each serve the purpose they are meant to. I love these."
I have other spatula sets that don't compare to these. These are outstanding. I don't worry about putting them in hot soups or items on the stove or in the oven to stir. Beautifully made.
I have used these to fry bacon and sausage. Also use them for eggs. They really don‚Äôt melt. So easy to use and clean. I‚Äôve got an extra set for myself and one for my sister.
"Love the texture, the sizes and the color. Highly recommend."
"I love spatulas, those are sturdy and well made, and on paper, they seem to be safe to use since they are LFGB approved. I have yet to use them. No updates from me means no problem with those."
"While I haven't had them long, I used one to stir fry rice and vegetables and they handled the heat with no problems. Lightweight yet strong rubber."
"We have been looking for some good spatulas for some time, I believe these are it. So far all they claim to be."
"Love these so much. Used last night, honestly could probably buy one set in each color. Love them that much. Thank you for a great product v"
These are quality spatulas! The different sizes are extremely handy and useful. They make life in the kitchen much easier.
Was looking for some solid spatulas that were easy to clean instead of the old two piece. These are great!! The old ones in the trash
I can tell these will be around much longer than my old fashion plastic on wood stick versions. Very pleased.
I love these spatulas so much I own two sets in different colors. I use one set for savory dishes and the other for sweet. They are very sturdy and heat resistant. I make candy that cooks to 300¬∞ and these are perfect for stirring. Easy to clean too
"Haven‚Äôt used yet but seem sturdy and look nice. Dishwasher safe, handle high temps according to product info."
"I just purchased my 4th order of these spatulas because they are so sturdy, scrape the side of the bowl really well without folding under and they are very easy to clean. As these spatulas are one solid piece, there are no nooks or crannies for bits of food to hide. One spatula that is long, rectangular and narrow will be very useful for spreading icing. The price makes these very affordable. They are a very good value and I bought sets for my family members who love to cook. I just purchased them so I will see how well they hold up. For now, I am very pleased with this purchase."
"These spatulas are just what I've been looking for - strong, easy to clean, attractive. These are all one piece so no problem with molding headpieces. Yay!"
Many uses for these great spatulas. I especially like the one solid piece design and they clean up well in the dishwasher!
Excellent quality. Solid. Good shapes for different kinds of scraping. Better than anything else at cleaning out a blender.
"The spatulas feel very study, easy to maintain a good grip plus so easy to clean and keep bacteria-free since they are one-piece procucts."
So easy to use for baking and stirring Cleans easy and is dishwasher safe
This is a very high quality spatula set. Came nicely boxed. Would make a great gift.
"I like everything about these spatulas. They fit the bill. My daughter is a chef, and she applauded."
They are exactly what I was looking for versatile and one for every need.
This set is the best. I have replaced all of my old spatulas and these are fantastic.
I've learned that having one piece instead of having the spoon attached to a handle is best.
Best thing is flexibility and dishwasher safe. Also love color.
"Does exactly what I need, stir ,scoop heat resistant and cleans up easily."
I really liked the quality and fast shipment!
solid and comfortable and works as it should
Product is well made and extremely functional. I would recommend them.
These come in handy and are professional tools.
These are great silicone utensils. The color goes really well with my kitchen.
Wish I had them years ago..
So far it's great. Works perfectly and cleans up easily.
It‚Äôs a good product highly recommend it.
"as advertised, good stuff"
I Absolutely recommend this product
I'd buy these again and recommend them to everyone. Very sturdy.
The long spatulas are great for getting inside peanut butter jars and spreading mayonnaise
These are great
They work beautifully and are durable. I love the assortment in size & design.
Items are as described and arrived on time
Really good product
A very good product
Baker goods are fattening lol
Fast shipping excellent product
"Multiple uses of different sizes! Sturdy,clean easy! Heat resistant is a major plus!"
Great so far
All the sizes you may need
"Love these spatulas, especially the slim one. The slim spatula fits into thin jars that the larger ones can't. Nothing sticks to them. The color doesn't fade. I have the blue; very nice."
Definitely recommend. Easy to hand wash but also dishwasher safe too.
"Just about perfect. Better than any other I've tried. For people that are having trouble with egg yolks breaking, three things:  1) Be sure to get BOTH sides of the flipper coated wirh grease before you touch an egg with it.  2) Make sure the egg has cooked, on the bottom, sufficiently before trying to flip it.  3) Give the pan a little jiggle to make sure the eggs are moving easily in the pan and have some grease under them.  Then, gently slide the flipper under the egg and turn it over. If you're trying to be healthy and not use grease, forget everything I've said and scramble your eggs."
"This turner is perfect for any level of cooking. The product arrived quickly and has served as the grilled cheese god! It‚Äôs not only a turner but a thin nylon flexible spatula as well. I‚Äôve used other good brands of cooking utensils (T-Fal, Martha stewart etc.) and paid an arm and a leg for my last thin non stick spatula and this oxo one is a a steal. You can see the size in the images. It‚Äôs small, flexible, and hangs up nicely. This is by far my favorite brand cookware as a novice cook and wife of a chef. My husband and I both use oxo as it truly is a neutral brand for all ranges of cooking expertise. It‚Äôs affordable and their utensils last forever. Plus cleaning = easy.  If you‚Äôre tired of surface damage to your food caused by not having the right non stick tools you need this product in your kitchen. Now I have a reason to brag, I have The best grilled cheese on the block. This has been a life goal of mine, I think we can all agree it‚Äôs hard to master a good grilled cheese.  If you want to make your spatula last - even though it‚Äôs dishwasher safe I recommend hand washing it. I also recommend using it with only high end or oxo brand pots and pans. When I use my oxo products together they never get scuffed up.  The stainless steel metal bar connecting the head of the spatula to the firm grip absorbs the heat excellent. It can definitely handle temperatures over 400 degrees but if you want to keep it from damage don‚Äôt go over 400 degrees. It‚Äôs safe and doesn‚Äôt overheat.  this tool is perfect for cooking and baking and the thin flexible nylon turner head turns hard to flip foods into works of art. No broken eggs, crepes, pancakes, or cookies! Right around the holiday? This is a must for baking.  I did use it on a non stick pan and it didn‚Äôt scratch my pan but given the feel of the nylon spatula head it probably would have scratched it if I wasn‚Äôt careful. Again it‚Äôs easy to clean and maintain, I personally recommend only using brands like oxo In your kitchen, I‚Äôve found cooking food with all the cookware from the same brand increases the quality of your food and preserves your cookware for YEARS. This brand is high end but also extremely fair on price.  + fast arrival + thin and small, comfortable grip + no surface damage to your grilled cheese + Grilled cheese master + small with comfy grip + heat absorber so it‚Äôs safe  Besides the stickers on the product being hard to get off, this product is a must for everyone in the kitchen."
"I am very disappointed. The edge of the turner has melted even using in a nonstick pan on nothing more than medium heat (and melted material got into food). Also, the handle began to melt when briefly in contact with pan edge. The turner is flimsy and food sticks to it. It is not easy to clean. I expected better quality from OXO as previous products were good."
"I have used dozens of non-stick spatulas over the past five decades, and this is by far the best. a dog literally chewed up the one I've used for 15 years now, so I bought two to replace it in case it ends up no longer being made. even with the dog chewings, it was still the best one.... my 80 lb chocolate lab chewed and chewed on it and deformed the middle of it a little bit.  I point that out because this is the only spatula, aside from the larger version of the same one, that wasn't eventually deformed or chewed up on the end by hot griddles, as has been the nearly immediate case with every other non-stick spatula brand I have owned. so, it has been the most consistent egg flipper.  that's really a huge statement given that it is thin enough to actually flip an egg, and more durable than spatulas three times as thickness"
"I have a number of Oxo grip equipment already in the kitchen. I like them for their handles and over all quality. When my old spatula had got to the point it had seen better days it was a no brainer to choose this...Not only was it an Oxo grip by the price on it was very fair...I received it within 3 days, (with prime shipping) and used it that night with some fried mushrooms and onions, as well as the next morning for breakfast. Though it makes a very nice spatula over all, I do have a couple of things that I noticed right off. One is it being really short. Probably not the best choice for a spatula or anything kicking up a lot of grease. Also, the actual spatula part is very thin...You can easily bend it and its not thick at all. But its strong enough for you to easily use on most fried things, and, its thinness is actually an asset for really getting underneath something thin, or stuck on. And one last thing...This was curved a little to much for me on arrival...I mean the bend in it was so sharp it made it a little too much for me being so short. Fortunately you can just get a good grip on it and bend it straighter which made in my opinion made it better...Overall a nice, quality spatula that carries a very fair price. Maybe a little thinner and shorter than I expected but its turned out to well do the job its supposed too...Recommended.."
"This is my second one, first one cracked after more than a decade of near daily use.  It is made of nylon, so it will melt at high temperature (but scrape the melty gunk off the edge with a sharp knife and it is fine). I have only run into the melting issue a few times, always with much higher heat than I normally use (searing steak, making smash burgers). It is something to be aware of, but it does not come up in 99% of situations.  It is very flexible, wide enough for big things and has rounded corners to use on little things. Does not scrape non stick coatings too.  Handle is comfortable, material and shape make it easy to clean.  I have used silicone spatulas as well and they don't stand up they way this one does (start to develop small cracks at leading edge). So I am not even sure a temperatie resistant non scratch version can be made. There is one with exactly the same shape but the turner is a flexible metal."
"I saw this spatula highly recommended by TheKitchn.com, and it was cheap enough that I thought I'd give it a try. I was concerned with how short it was, but it got such a glowing review that if nothing else it would make a good backup spatula. It turns out the shorter length makes it easier to use, especially with the metal rods connecting the handle with the spatula itself. I can control how I pick things up and flip them better with the shorter length, although I've noticed a few times I had a little trouble getting a burger turned over but that's probably more to my own dexterity. I've dinged it for cleaning because a couple of times I've washed it and noticed grease left behind. I'm not sure why that happened, but it wasn't a big deal to give it a second washing, and that happens all the time with my glass lids."

"Pros: 1. Thin spatula so you‚Äôre able to get under your food better for flipping. ie: over easy eggs, pancakes, etc. 2. Because it‚Äôs thin it‚Äôs more versatile 3. Heavy duty Handle w/ metal body makes it more sturdy  Cons: None  I personally buy several and cut them so they are more pan/food friendly: Little pans 8‚Äù I like a smaller spatula so I cut with scissors the same pattern only about 1‚Äù shorter. Not necessary. I just personally prefer to flip eggs when the spatula part fits in smaller pans or bigger ones that are the size of the product I am flipping."
"When it first arrived, I thought the handle was going to be too short. However, this little spatula is perfect. The head is narrow and slides easily under food and is non-stick. I did order this following Cook's Illustrated recommendations, and I am very happy with it. I would order it again or even as a gift for a foodie who cooks. Only caveat -- It could melt if you don't treat it responsibly so don't leave it sitting in a pan when the stove eye is on. Use that spoon rest. Trust me!"
"Regardless of pan-size, THIS is the tool I prefer for cooking FRIED EGGS. I do prefer to use small pans for frying 1 or 2 eggs and I might have more than one pan going at the same time. SO, with the small pan-size in-Mind, the blade is the perfect size for the job AND its THIN, heat-resistant material glides right under the egg making it easy to pick-up and flip or simply serve it/them to a plate. I just can't seem to flip eggs IN THE PAN, so I gotta have a tool that works for me. THIS IS IT. Now... a word about HEAT RESISTANCE... the blade resists the effects of heat very well, HOWEVER the HANDLE doesn't resist as well. Note that it advertises that its heat resistant - hot heat PROOF. I've melted some spots on the handle because I wasn't paying enough attention. OOPS! I gladly ordered another one so all's well again. SO, just be careful... don't lay the tool in the pan so the edge of the pan can melt the rubber handle material... and YOU'LL LOVE THIS TOOL! Enjoy."
One of two of my favorites! It is 100% everything they said it is. It has flex it can lift a heavy burger and yet get under a fried egg and flip it without breaking. It is easy to clean and nice to hold. The length is long enough and creates a great balance in your hand to make cooking easy. The rounded edges are tapered from the center to the edge making it simple to scrap around the pan or dish. I can easily get under bacon and flip them too.
"Another great product from OXO! It's my new favorite, easy to use and clean.  I see, that, there are several reviews complaining about it melting - ludicrous!  It's made of NYLON you can NOT leave it your pan because it will melt, duh!  Use it and remove from your pan, if you can't do this, then I suggest you purchase a metal turner."
"I had this product for Year's! The spatula part is red. It is still as nice as the day it was purchased and that was 18-19 years ago. It gets every day use. I am putting together a "" my first home package"" for the kitchen. I am buying all the item's I feel a starter cook need's for success. This is one of the item's I feel will help with that success. Eggs, omelets, burgers. If it needs turning or lifting, this spatula holds up!"
"Great turner.... very small size compared to the one I bought in the store.  I have a turner that looks and acts just like this one, except that the one that I bought in the store is about twice this size. I will keep this turner as this size might be very handy, but truly I didn't even know they made this size. I have reread the product description and I don't see any measurements. The size of this was a surprise. Still I really like the larger one and am assuming that that this will work just the same."
I came to Amazon to replace these spatulas that I bought at the grocery store several years ago. Very easy to clean (dishwasher safe) and great on non-stick pans. I bought two because I use one nearly every day for everything from scrambling eggs to serving baked chicken breasts. My daughter left one on the cooktop too long and the edge melted. Then I noticed the other was showing wear. I had them probably 5 years so I consider that a reasonable lifespan for a plastic spatula. Just remember not to let them rest on the cooktop or in the pan.
"Recently both my husband and I had been struggling flipping over easy eggs w/out breaking them and we were simply getting frustrated with ourselves. This didn't use to be an issue. Anyway, we moved, thought we lost a spatula so I bought this one. Told my husband it was supposed to be ""made for"" egg flipping. You should have heard him scream with excitement when he first used it. Needless to say, it works beautifully and we're back to perfectly flipped eggs. Now we find ourselves trying to understand why this utensil works so much better than the last. (smile)"
"I basically use this for fried eggs and have tried many spatulas over the years, but this is the best by far. Because of its thinness and flexibility it easily slides underneath even the most delicate food items without causing crumbling/breaking or folding of the food. Another great feature is the short handle which helps to control the flipping and turning over of eggs, pancakes etc. The spatula is also very easy to clean and is the second one I bought because if two people are cooking at the same time, they both want this particular spatula."
"I've used this several times now and like the flexibility of the blade portion and that the handle can rest on the side of the pan without melting. In a standard fry pan, this is the size I keep reaching for because it's just the right size. I did order the larger slotted turner made by oxo as well. I wanted something that would drain oil when deeper frying. Great brand, great tools."
I have been looking for a super thin spatula & this is it. It's sturdy & flexible along with being very thin to get under your food to flip. Other spatulas have been too thick making it hard to get under many types of food. I use it almost everyday & it looks like new. I will purchase again when this one wears out.
"I have yet to be disappointed with any Oxo products that I‚Äôve purchased and this one also gets high marks. They can be a little more expensive than others out there but I think it‚Äôs worth it for the quality. Be careful when you take off the tag that is around the handle as I had to use a knife to get it off. Also, when considering this item it sits a little higher in a drawer than most."
"While I have just used this spatula once so it is improper to say if it is heat resistance, the only way I would know is if I left it sitting in a sizzling hot pan for too long and saw it start to melt! Who does that? It looks strong enough and it doesn't transfer heat into the handle, so it does a good job of turning burgers! I did think it was going to be larger, but it's perfect for burgers on non-stick pans!"
"I am a big fan of this kitchen product. It is great since we have primarily non-stick pots and pans. This is my go to tool when anything needs flipping in the kitchen. I left an old one of these at a vacation house and when I noticed after getting home, I immediately ordered another. Would highly recommend for use on non-stick pans."
"I love that this spatula is thin. It's slightly flexible for flipping eggs and pancakes, but sturdy enough for flipping wontons and scraping french fries from the pan (I bake my fries). I'm so impressed, I plan to purchase a few more. The handle stays cool and the length is on perfect for 12""-14"" pans, not too long and definitely not too short. Strongly recommend as the PERFECT spatula."
"Love it! New, cleans easily, and works great for my Green Pans. Typically, I don't dishwasher pots and pans (washed by hand), but I do dishwasher utensils. This cleans up nicely, and has a great angle--easy to move food. Very solid. It works as described on delicate fish meat (or any other food); salmon fillet stayed together moving from cookware to dinner plate. It has a very fine (thin) edge, which is super when trying to slide underneath food. I will buy some more. I prefer the black, but they have other colors, too. It's be great if they had a larger (longer version) for those larger food items. They might! I didn't check."
"I did not have an electric griddle when I first used this product. I used it for flipping pancakes in a skillet on my gas top stove. Thus, the spatula shows a little melting on the edge. I don't think it was designed for a gas top as my ability to control the temperature of the heat is not the same as with an electric griddle."
"I much prefer the shorter handled flippers and this one from Oxo is very nice. Obviously you don't want to leave the handle lying against a hot pan, it is a plastic product afterall! Nice wide lip, perfect for pancakes!"
"I was hesitant to spend so much on a pancake flipper, so over time I bought two other spatulas to try to avoid having to pay for this, but finally ended up splurging because you can't match the quality, sturdiness, thin-ness, etc. of this flipper. We received our first as a wedding present 14 years ago and it is still going strong. We bought the second for our camper."
"I've pretty much used this exclusively for fried eggs, works great. It CAN have some sticking issues with the edges, but it isn't often. Also, I can't remember if mine had it, but a relative got this same product and it had a sticker on it that took a good 15 minutes of scraping with sticker remover just to get it fully clean. Made no sense why anyone would add a sticker like that to a cooking utensil on a part that is going to be used to touch food. OXO should know better than that in the first place."
"My new favorite spatula for turning eggs. Thin and flexible, can work a little bit like a rubber spatula, but strong enough to get under and lift foods. Not the spatula for chopping things in the pan or browning ground meat, of course. :) No vents or slots means easy cleanup - just wipe it off!"
"Hesitant to buy this even with the quality OXO name because of the negative reviews on melting and weak flipping action. No problems on either account. Some cooks leave the spatula in pan upside down for convenience; not good, eventually even titanium will suffer. It won't flip a 48 ounce T-bone on the grill...wrong tool."
"I really like these thin spatulas. They are great for cookies or eggs. I wore out a pair that I purchased 5yrs ago, and need to order replacements. They clean easily if you wipe them off after use, and wash by hand. I learned it's best not to put them in dishwasher. They are my favorite go to spatula."
I ordered this by mistake but I have to say this turner is great! I had one I threw out because the heat would fry the front edge and wanted a silicone one. So far no crimped edges!! Does have food stick on edge of turner but it cleans easier than the other one I had. OXO never disappoints!!
"This is the third or fourth one of these I've owned - I love them. The size is perfect - not too big, not too small. I like the flexibility of the paddle itself - it's perfect for eggs. I did rate 4 stars for heat resistance - the edges will melt if you don't watch it. However, normal usage, it's fine."
I bought one of these about 5 years ago and it has served me well. I use it all the time. My husband bought me a larger sturdier black spatula because he said we needed two. It cracked after two years. I just ordered 3 more of these OXO Good Grips Spatulas so my husband doesn‚Äôt feel the need to by more that won‚Äôt last. I still have my original one too. They are easy on Teflon and you can flip an egg with ease.
"I use it for turning pancakes. It works great. The blade is nylon or plastic, so I don't leave it against the hot griddle very long, but I've had no problem with it. Like other OXO products I use, it's beautifully made. Looks and feels great."
My cast iron pan that I have used for many years suddenly showed scratches. I discovered it was from my metal spatula. I purchased this shortly after Christmas. Scratches have disappeared!
"I've been looking for months in local stores for these Oxo flexible turners, I've had a number of them over the past 15 years. Very thin so easy to turn delicate things, like over easy eggs, without breaking. I'm hard on my tools, constant use, eventually these can split a tiny bit on an edge if you flex them a lot for a long time. Worth the money, I now have three so I don't have to wash after every use, just toss in dishwasher."
I use this spatula for breakfast scrambled eggs and just everything for turning and flipping food from breakfast to dinner. It has a good springing action and adheres to food to flip it or turn it. Best spatula that I ever cooked with.
Husband doesn't like it's flexibility but I'm the usual cook and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for as all my other non-stick spatulas were so thick and stiff it was very difficult to turn over anything delicate like egg or fish. This is perfect! Would buy again.
"I like the size. It's shorter than what I was expecting. I use it to make pancakes and remove cookies from the cookie sheet. I have noticed it does need extra cleaning when used to make scrambled eggs. Overall, very satisfied."
Good Grips is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù for well made ergonomic household items. This little spatula is be exception. Great for moving cookies from the baking tray to the cooling rack. But also nice whenever I need a small spatula. Well made. Easy to use. Easy to clean.
"I LOVE this spatula!! It is made out of a very thin hard plastic. It is so so thin, unlike many of the plastic spatulas I‚Äôve owned, very easy to slide under sandwiches, omelets, etc. I love that it won‚Äôt scratch my pans but still offers all the benefits of a metal spatula."
"Perfect for pancakes and cookies, my old spatula was so thick it could get under things. This one is perfect. My pan doesn't even move you can perfectly get under cookies."
Bought a really nice pan so needed tools to be gentle on the surface. I can still manage to heat damage any product but really happy with this!!!
"My old spatula wore out and I needed a new one to use with my non-stick frying pans. I needed one large enough to flip eggs, but not too large, and this one is the perfect size. I've used it 2 months now and it is nice and flexible enough for eggs, hash browns or pancakes. Cleans up well and looks like it will last a long time."
"This pancake turner/spatula/whatever you want to call it, works well. It probably will melt if you try to cook it by leaving it in a hot pan or on a griddle, but if you use it as it was designed to be used, you will have no problems.  Recommended"
I like that this is almost soft. It bends easily so you do not think it will ruin the bottom of your pans. But if you are looking for hard this is not for you.
"I just bought this for my daughter because I've had the same one for years. It's my go-to cooking spatula, the one I prefer to use. It's a perfect size. I've had mine forever and it still looks like new."
"This product works well for flipping eggs cooked over easy or over hard in a skillet. It comes clean in the top rack of the dishwasher. I haven't subjected it to high heat, so I can't say how it would ensure."
This is a great little spatula. I just bought the OXO griddle and needed a non metal spatula to use with it. This one is perfect.
It is firm and flexible and works great in tight places and doesn't loose its flex and is the best one I have ever bought. I bought a 2nd one to have in the case I loose the previous one.
"Our old kitchen-aid spatula finally bit the dust, so I was looking for an inexpensive replacement. I'm surprised by how well this good grips performs for the price. When it arrived, it looked very thin, but that actually makes it ideal for flipping pancakes. It seems very durable and has been really easy to clean. Doesn't scratch my pans. I will probably buy 2-3 more of these as I prefer it over the other thicker spatulas we have."
"This spatula is the perfect size for eggs pancakes omelets grilled sandwiches etc~ sturdy, comfortable to hold and just as wonderful as everything I have purchased from OXO~"
Absolutely my favorite spatula. I gotten one almost 10 years ago and fell in love with it. I've had two new ones since because one my son stole from me Lol üòÜ and the other got old.  They are great for getting underneath things and lifting them without interfering with something else in the pan excellent for pancakes eggs etc.
This size skillet is perfect for many different uses. Food slides off perfectly. Uniform cooking. My favorite skillet is this brand from now on.
Best turner in my house now I love how it easily slides under food and and then size is perfect for many things not to small or big.
I would highly recommend this spatula. Purchased two and they are both excellent quality. Hold up to heat well. Flexible and sturdy. Handle seems secured well. It is thinner than any other spatula I've owned so I find it especially helpful in that regard. Washes up easily. Overall great!
"Lightweight and just the right length for flipping burgers, fish, or eggs. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price."
"This is my second one, wore out the first after many years. I love the thin edge on this. It makes for easy slide under delicate things like fried eggs."
"Extremely thin and flexible, just what I was looking for. My mother had some very old/used spatulas that were older than me and after years of use on iron skillets their edges had been honed and sharpened to the point they could cut someone. Seriously. I liked using them in the kitchen, especially with omelettes because they could easily sweep beneath things in a skillet without tearing them like the thick, non-flexible metal ones. These remind me of my mother's spatulas so I got 2 for me (small and large) and the same for her.  Pros: thin (less than 1mm thick), flexible, multiple, sizes, rubber grip Cons: too flexible for some jobs"
"After using this for a few months, I discarded my heavy, clunky spatulas and ordered a 2nd one of these. They are thin and flexible, yet sturdy enough to lift medium pizza from pizza pan. Perfect for cooking and baking, and won‚Äôt damage my non-stick enamel pans."
"My husband & I have three or four of these! They really get underneath food or ingredients very well because it's so thin. Although it is thin it can hold a lot of weight. Browning hamburger needs another tool because it's a little too flexible. Perfect for baking, flipping things in the oven & getting between food and foil."
"Quite thin but sturdy. Flexible, wide enough surface. Good comfortable handle. Seems you could use this in the kitchen....and elsewhere."
"This is my most favorite spatula for most foods. It works well and will not damage non-stick coatings. I've used it for eggs, burgers, cookies, french toast, grilled cheese, etc I like the very thin but relatively strong blade that allows you to easily get under food to better flip it. The only real downside is that eggs have to be hand scrubbed off. It won't clean up nicely in the dishwasher if you make scrambled eggs with it. For me, this is not a huge issue. I would estimate that these spatulas last about 3 years (they get brittle and begin to crack)...this seems about right to me and I would buy a new one every 3 years unless I find something else with better durability."
I love this spatula! It‚Äôs perfect for making all types of eggs! I‚Äôm definitely going to order one or two more!
"Great product! This is my third of this spatula. I love the size and quality of this tool. My first two were inadvertently rested too long on a hot pan and deformed. Not a product fault, my own. It does have a slightly textured surface, so you really have to scrub it to get clean, but it‚Äôs worth the little extra time. It‚Äôs pretty sturdy and just the perfect size for our pans."
"I looked and looked to find a perfect SHORT and thin flexible spatula. I took this chance and have been thanking myself ever since. We actually find ourselves a bit peturbed in this household when we find somebody's gotten it used before we had our go. The good thing though, is it cleans up so easily and quickly, we unbristle and use it for our own purposes in 60 seconds. This is an item you will definitely want to buy in pairs. Thin, flexible yet wide enough for what ever your flippin!! Tip doesn't go all melty even in high temps like deeper fat (like cooking sausage links & patties)"
I recently ordered this product as a replacement and was not sure it was the Small (S) size. Fortunately it is the (S) size and is just perfect for eggs etc... You do have to be careful not to leave it on a hot burner !!! My Bad !!!
Great to use on non-stick pans and everything else. Even my husband commented on how much better it works than our old metal one. Flexibility makes this useful for many applications in the kitchen.
So far they have been cooked with and put in a dishwasher and have made it out alive . I‚Äôm so glad these are not bamboo. They are very very good utensils ...also pointing out in the photos I am putting quite a bit of pressure on this just so you realize they will give but have held up eggs and nice sized omelets so far and I can get them to the plate without dropping them so they have another star that would be added if it was applicable . I also want to notify anyone that is planning on purchasing these that I bought these for my pan set which are 18/10 stainless steel and I have to cook at a lower temp then when I had the cheaper pans. They take time getting used to but again in my opinion nothing should be cooked at a high temp unless your planning on burning or melting your food or utensils. They are Better then I expected.I didn‚Äôt notice a major smell when I opened mine but even if I did no matter what you are using plastic to cook your Food regardless so smells are to be expected. Thank you!!
"I purchased this utensil set when my previous ones were pretty ratty - and I had put the purchase off for far too long because I couldn't find precisely what I wanted. This purchase was sort of last-minute and ""well, let's see..."". The reviews seemed to be good, so I figured it was worth a shot. Some reviewers had mentioned that they were kind of ""small."" I don't find that to be the case at all, but I am a petite person. They are comfortable in my hands.  - Color: As specified. I would suggest to the seller to add more colors! Mint green doesn't really go with my kitchen. I would have chosen something else if there was a choice. Also: tomato-based foods can make it hard to scrub the orange off on such a light color. Still, I'd purchase again even if this is the only color option.  - Size: comfortable, good weight These seem to be sturdy and the handles fit nicely into my hand.  - Clean up: They're fairly easy to clean - except for those brightly-colored foods, like tomato and pumpkin. They seem to try to stain the silicone. I do have to scrub at them a bit for that. I hand-wash these only. I do not want to damage the wood finish on the handles by putting them in the dishwasher.  - Overall value: good These were really good utensils for the price. I would recommend them and I'd give them as a gift. I would purchase again in the future."
"I love this set. I‚Äôve been using these utensils with my stainless steel cooking set and they have not been damaged at all. I generally clean them and dry them right away to prevent cracking in the wood.  I‚Äôve used most of them to cook chili and pasta, saut√© veggies, baking, etc.  My only pet peeve with this is that after I clean (and more than once) they still have a slight smell of the food I had cooked. If anyone knows how to fix this let me know!  But yes, other than that I am still happy with the purchase. :)"
Love the quality and silicone texture of these utensils. Looks Gorgeous in the kitchen!
"The function of these utensils are ok. But the handles are all different colors and textures. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the way they‚Äôre supposed to be, but the main picture doesn‚Äôt make it appear that way. Oh and not to mention the whisk came out of the handle after a week. I‚Äôm attempting to stain them on my own only because I would have returned them had I not thrown away the box."
"I think the product is greatz durable. I did read reviews before purchasing and some did say there was a smell. When I opened the box they smelled like nail polish, it was very very strong. I had them in our basement to let them air out after about a week they didn't smell anymore."
"Love this turquoise set. Color of handles are all the same. Maybe a very SLIGHT difference in some but nothing overly noticeable! I pulled pretty hard in each on and NONE came apart or wiggled in any way, I even hit them against my hand several times and they held up. I have nit used them too cook with yet, as our kitchen is still being remodeled so I can't review on heat or if they stain. The seasoning brush will come off but it slides right back on with ease. The canister to hold the utensils is kinda small for my liking, but everything does fit without hassle."
"Overall this is a really attractive set for the money with some really well-thought-out tools (like mixing utensils with 1 flat and 1 curved side to handle both rounded and straight-edged containers). And it‚Äôs really nice to be able to use them with hot pans without worrying about them melting on the pan edge (like plastic utensils). And while it‚Äôs definitely snug, all the utensils do just fit into the utensil holder, which is surprisingly low-profile for all those items. The only thing to be aware of is that they are hand-wash recommended (because of the bamboo), so that‚Äôs not quite so great, but luckily they are much easier to clean than plastic utensils, since the food comes off pretty easily, even when dried on. So, I think this is an excellent set at a very reasonable cost, considering how much comes with it ‚Äî strong recommend!"
"These are gorgeous and functional! They‚Äôre easy to clean, just make sure to hand wash with a bit of soap and water on the silicone only, or ensuring that the wooden handles are thoroughly dried, never in the dishwasher, as I‚Äôm trying to train the boyfriend!  I love the versatile utensils, and array of firmness of rubber spatulas for multiple applications. The stiffest one is perfect for mixing doughs, or chopping hamburger. I do recommend a larger utensil holder, as the one it comes with is very tight, and I like them loose so I can rifle through them to find what I want to use.  Well worth the money!"
"I just opened my new utensils today and I was so excited!! They were exactly what I was looking for! I have a blue/yellow theme in my kitchen and they fit in great! They are slightly flimsy, but was to be expected. They aren‚Äôt too flimsy that food will fall off though. I‚Äôd say they are perfect! Don‚Äôt get these if you like the traditional hard plastic utensils because the feel of these ones is way different.. This would even be a perfect gift for someone! I do have 2 complaints.. My first complaint is that the description was misleading.. the product was advertised as ‚Äúbamboo handles‚Äù but the box I received said ‚Äúbeach wood‚Äù... they are still beautiful but I would have preferred to been aware of the actual material.. My second complaint is that the color is a bit more dull/dark than the picture advertised.. I still have yet to cook with these, so I will be updating my review when I do"
"I waited to review these kitchen utensils before posting a review. It makes me crazy when people review without doing that. They worked great in my hot pans. Each utensil is a little smaller than what I am used to. As an example, the ladle and spatula are about 3‚Äù across at their widest point, and the ladle holds about 1/2 cup. I don‚Äôt miss the smaller size, I simply do not need larger utensils than this. I am finding all the utensils easy to use, even with my smaller pots and pans. The holder does not take up a lot of space on the countertop and holds all the utensils. The handles are strong, with a nice finish. The utensils wash well. I have been hand washing them to be kind to the wood. The utensils look and feel as if they will hold up well, even with lots of kitchen use. I will update this review if the durability of the utensils does not meet with my expectations."
I had to buy this set on short notice and wasn't able to do much research.. but I couldn't have chosen better. These things look great and more importantly work great. I have used all of the utensils.. even ones I didn't think I would use. They all work great and feel great in your hands. The silicone is good quality. I highly recommend this set. The only thing that is cheap in this set is the cup to store them in if you keep them on your counter. It is too small and too light weight.. but I just put them in something else. Also not important if you keep them in a drawer.
Love love love these! I've recommended these to family and bought 5 sets for gifts & everyone loves them. They do not bend when cooking they hold up to heat the handles dont get hot and don't slide in your hand when your hand are wet or have food on them. They clean up real easy and hold up well in the dishwasher. When people come over to my kitchen they always ask me where I got them. For the price its a awesome deal!
"I purchased this set in December 2020. When I received the product, the wooden handles were all raw, not polished but it takes way too long to return and reorder process since I live in Hawaii usually shipping takes way longer than in mainland. I thought I could just sand/polish and use it. So I did it but it did not last long, I got splinters on my hands whenever I used it. Meanwhile I missed the time to claim for return or refund. I contacted the seller and informed them that I think I received a defected one. The seller emailed me back right away apologized and asked me to send a photo of it so they can share it with the factory also asked me my shipping address to send a new set. I sent photos and received a whole new set.  I contacted the seller almost 5 months after I bought it. The way they deal with this type of issue was proper, accountable, polite and quick."
"I‚Äôm absolutely in üíú love with this set! The colors are bright and the material is high quality. Others complained about a smell, but mine did not have a smell. They‚Äôre holding up well and their color is still vibrant. They don‚Äôt scratch my pots and pans and I like that they are sturdy enough to work like a spoon but also have a little give to them making them more versatile. This set comes with more tools than other brands. Highly recommended!!! Very satisfied customer."
"I got a new set of pots and pans and decided I needed to take care of them, so I bought these to reduce the scraping of metal on metal. I absolutely love them. You do have to give them a little extra love by handwashing them, but it's worth it. The only complaint my husband had was that when cooking meat they are too flimsy to cut the meat in half, so when cooking say beef for sloppy Joe's then you have a hard time breaking it up. Other than this I did receive a box of the utensils without a wisk. But Amazon took care of it right away. They had me send the set I received back and I had the replacements within 2 days. Overall I was amazed at their service."
"I purchased this set of cookware to gift my wife for Christmas. We have a caddy on your counters with a variety of cooking utensils that was beat up and mismatched. When looking for a set, I wanted something with quality, that would look good in the kitchen and be simple to clean. This set meets all of those requirements.  We have used every tool so far since being opened on Christmas day, and my wife is beyond thrilled with the ease of use and quality of this package. We have received a handful of comments from guests about how nice they look. We for once are proud to have a matching set of cookware on your kitchen counter. I may be purchasing another set in the future to gift my mom on her upcoming birthday.  As a side note, the utensils had a mild chemical odor to them upon unpackaging them. After a thorough cleaning, they off gated in no time. This isn't a negative trait, but just wanted to leave a comment to reassure the smell goes away quickly."
"I just received my set and so far I have nothing but good things to say. This product is very sturdy and well build. I'm always worried about bending or breaking my kitchen utensils. These ones seem nice and tough, but also soft enough for teflon coating. I bought this for my future mother in law, and she darn near cried of joy. The free holder that came with it is very cheap, unstable, and really doesn't fit all of the utensils. Doesn't bother me, we are using the old utensil holder for decor purposes. I have not owned this set long enough to rate the test of time and heavy usage, but I will update if anything is wrong."
"The color looks very pretty (got the turquoise set). Wooden handle allows for a good grip. Silicone heads allow to scrape food from pots/pans so that they don't burn on the sides or bottom. Very easy to clean and convenient to use. I got a ""utensil holder"" of the same color, so the entire thing looks like one set.  When I opened the package they smelled like paint. Washing it would not make the smell go away. So I left it out to air for a few days and now the smell has gone. Now I feel comfortable washing and using it. Also, if you cook with turmeric or any other spices that can leave a stain be careful not to get anything on the wooden handle. It will leave a mark. Other than that, product quality is great and they look very pretty in my kitchen."
"We have my old of utensils made with woodÔºåbut as time goes byÔºåthey all become dark and darkÔºåit's hard to clean. Finally this is the start of a new cooking product set. Great quality, I'm pleasantly surprised! These have a nice long handle and the plastic is not flimsy at all and wont be messing up my non stick pans with scratches. Very happy with this purchase and the brand, I would definitely recommend these for anyone who wants a good looking product that works great!"
"Thought way too many items for the price to be any good right? SURPRISE !!! Excellent quality, plenty of tools, a few I really can use, sandwich spreader, did not know it was included, too. Great selection of kitchen tools, now on my counter. ONLY item is the plastic jar to hold them is too small, does not match the quality of the tools. I purchased a ceramic vase to hold them that is a little bigger and taller, not a complaint, but a point to make."
"I just bought a house and needed some good cooking utensils. These are great, good price and they delivered quickly. Next time I need anything for my kitchen I will stick to this brand. The only bad thing, when you first get them they smell a bit strong like a weird plastic smell but a good wash and that's taken care of."
"Really nice quality, other reviews said the wood handles were different colors, but that was not the case for the order I received. I ordered the Gray color and I love them. I had been looking for a set that matches (I recently bought a home!) and this really is what I had envisioned. The only thing I would say, is that the utensil holder is extremely cheap looking. A very light plastic material and small for the amount of utensils that would go in there."
"I absolutely love these utensils. They're very sturdy, some are stiff and some aren't, which is wonderful. They're the perfect set!  On a more sad note- DO NOT SOAK THESE!!!!!! You should never soak wooden utensils at all anyways, but these especially cannot be soaked for long. The glue separates and it will come apart unfortunately. They are NOT dishwasher safe, as with all wooden utensils. But if you, like myself, don't want to ruin your brand new pricey cookware, hand-washing is something you do anyways (as there is no true dishwasher safe cookware either). Just don't risk it, or you'll lose your favorite rue whisk."
"I was in desperate need of new utensils and this set is perfect! They are not dishwasher safe, which is the only thing I would change about them. I think you could get away with putting them in the dishwasher, but the wood would fade quicker. I have just been washing wish dish soap and trying not to get the wood handles too wet. So far they have been easy to clean and a great addition to my kitchen! I avoid hand washing dishes at all costs but these take literal seconds to clean."
"A nice addition to the kitchen, recently re-painted in Carolina Blue. In addition to these utensils being a good aesthetic match, they all are on the countertop ready to use. No scouring over-stuffed drawers. The only criticism I have is that the holder is a bit small for 16 pieces so I opted to purchase a larger matching ceramic one. But I didn't buy the Mibote for the holder."
"I think if anyone gives this a low rating it's because they aren't taking care of it. I love this set and have had zero issues. I think a couple of people said something about the wood handles splitting. I haven't experienced that but I don't leave mine soaking in a sink a long time nor do I use the dishwasher with the wooden handle ones. They are an easy quick clean, soaking isn't really necessary. It's like anything, take care of it and it will serve you well."
"This set looks great, works well, and seems to be durable. Since I had discovered that the average person ingests about a credit card in grams of micro-plastic per week, I‚Äôve been trying to be careful about what I buy. Silicon utensils are great, but I have purchased some in the past that haven‚Äôt been sturdy enough to use. I haven‚Äôt had these very long, but these are firm enough to flip my eggs, and I like the vibrant color. For this price, I was expecting something cheap looking, but it‚Äôs actually quite nice looking."
I love this set! They are a very pretty color. They are sturdy and feel good in your hand. They clean up really easily. There was a slight order when I unpacked them like others have commented on in their reviews; but it was not overwhelming and quickly disappeared to not even noticeable as they were exposed to open air. I will be using another crock to keep them in though.
I was very pleased with the quality of this product. Very well made. You get a lot for your money. It really covers the utensil needs of any kitchen. Nicely packaged and the wooden handles are solid. The silicone parts of the utensils are well made. Thick. Not flimsy at all. This would make a great gift for someone moving into their first apartment. I highly recommend this!
"Although I haven't had the chance to use all of the tools in the package, I have observed that they seem to be of high quality, easy to use and attractive. I chose the brown, which is a deep chocolate color. The handles are finished wood, which I don't plan to put in the dishwasher or let soak in the sink, but hand wash in warm soapy water. It is a good value for the price."
i love them so much they fit perfectly in my kitchen but even better they are durable they dont break they are soft on your pans. they are easy to clean and i use them for everything
Aside from looking good the are very functional and work well.
"We saw these utensils in an Airbnb we stayed at and loved them. I only wish it came with one wider spatula for flipping larger items like an omelette, French toast etc but we make it work. A nice set!"
"Bought this for my daughter to match the pot set that I bought her for Christmas. These were her birthday gift. She loves them, says they work very nicely with her non stick pot set and that she loves the color, they are cute, cute, cute. Her first set of pots were orange, which was hard to find anything to go with, but this blue is fun and there are lots of matching stuff like this awesome utensil set. In fact, I'm jealous, I might get myself a set, all my utensils are black."
"The one on the right its the cup it came with, it is to small for all the awesome colorful stuff it cam with! I recommend BUT the box says ‚Äúdo not put on dishwasher & dont let the woid part soaked in water & please clean them before used them‚Äù they do have a very strong smell. Other than that inloveeeee with themmmmm"
"These utensils are just as described. Every tool anyone would ever need excepting a vegetable peeler. The wooden handles would be better had they come sanded and coated with oil or stained, but the price would reflect this."
"I cook with cast iron pans, and was worried these might melt when they touch the bottom. Turns out they don't! I love using these for flipping eggs, stirring stew, and grabbing pasta. The blue color is my favorite and the quality hasn't degraded after months of using and washing. Love them! The handles even have holes so you can hang them if you want."
"After searching and searching, I am so happy I went with these! This is a great deal for so many utensils. I haven't left them in the sink / standing water so the handles are holding up very well! Couldn't be happier"
"I couldn't be happier with this purchase! I bought them because I got some new Blue Diamond pots and pans that can't be scratched with normal utensils but I use them with everything I own now. They are strong, efficient, safe and look pretty sitting on my counter in that blue holder they came with. A++++"
"Everything you need is in this bundle. I find myself using extra utensils when cooking. I mean why not! They are high quality. The only thing I would change is having a larger sized spatula. The size offered is smaller than I had hoped. However, it gets the job done."
"While these did have a paint scent in the beginning, it went away after two washes. They are very sturdy. We got the black ones (more of a grey color in person) and we love them. The container they come in is cheap and very small though. I just bought one from Ikea instead. The key to keeping these utensils nice is not washing them in the dishwasher and not soaking the handles in water."
"Wonderful product. They feel sturdy and look very nice. I haven‚Äôt tested out the heat resistance yet but I don‚Äôt think that should be an issue. I read some reviews that the plastic had a bad odor. Well, if we read the outside of the box it comes in, it says to wash the product before first use to remove manufacturing odor. Once I washed it, the odor was gone."
So I bought a different brand that was supposed to be amazon‚Äôs choice and I hated it. Returned it asap. But THIS set right here is perfect. I absolutely love it!!!!! Best purchase ever and I have utensils I‚Äôve always wanted but never purchased. And I also love that the handles are wooden. Just an overall great product and I‚Äôve used them for a few days now.
"I have had these several months by now, and really like them. Every utensil I could imagine using is in the is pack. there are a couple that seldom get used, but overall I use most and they are very handy. At first I was put off a bit that I couldn't wash them in the dishwasher, but they are so easy to clean that it really doesn't matter to me at all anymore. I like the color pop so I have them out on my counter in a canister. Looks really nice."
Love these! So pretty and cheery color. Now I have to decide if I want to display them in a canister on the counter or hide them in a drawer. Seems a shame to hide them.
"So far I‚Äôve given it a five star. Straight out of the box a five! The firmness and wood is quality from the initial grab. After cooking with it, it was comfortable and stood the heat for my pancakes. Rinsed it right away and the food came off very easily. Used the wisk for the batter and it came out fine and rinsed off well! All of the pieces fit in the container, I kept the grater out."
Look no further these are great utensils they're very different but they're very good and there is a wide variety.
"Now that I'm more conscious of using BPA-free plastic cooking, storage and serving utensils this 11-piece silicone cooking utensil set was a perfect replacement for all my kitchen tools! The tools are well made, a great selection of kitchenware pieces. The size of the spatulas, spoons, ladles, tongs, etc., are the perfect length/width, and the handles are just the right length! This is a great buy not only for myself but as gifts, too!"
"My girl was looking for a silicone soup ladle, we couldn‚Äôt find one in shops, they‚Äôre all plastic, and she wants it turquoise for kitchen theme, anyways I found this kit and she likes it"
Hi I bought these for my Granddaughter whom is in her 3rd year at Oklahoma City C University /Ann Lacy School of Dance and this year she has on campus apartment. After this semester with a kitchen she released she needed things to make meals. This was what I bought and she was so Thrilled to get. In fact I like them so much I want a set for me now
Love this set! They are very sturdy and easy to clean. I'll definitely be purchasing this set again for house warming presents etc.
Love this set!!! Beautiful color and nice quality. So far so good!!!
Wow I‚Äôm so impressed with these utensils. I recently purchased an expensive set of non stick cookware and I needed these utensils to protect the nonstick surfaces. The materials used to make them are sturdy and I love the wooden handles.
Great selection of kitchen tools. No potato masher. Won‚Äôt damage pans. Very cheap holder- I won‚Äôt use it and I‚Äôll keep my original ceramic holder. But still a great value.
I'm enjoying using my new utensils. The color with the wood looks good. The canister makes them easily accessible and I'm loving that!!! Thanks
"I just got this set two weeks ago and I love them! They're very durable; the silicone isn't 'mushy' at all. Color is gorgeous, and the selection of tools is spot on, esp. for those of us who have non-stick pots and pans. You're still going to need smaller spatulas to get things out of cans, e.g. all the cat food. But this set has otherwise got you covered. The tongs particularly are very handy. So happy I got this set!"
Really great quality easy to clean I will say I do only hand wash them to keep them lasting longer good I cook with them everyday with my new pots and pans there very nice for the price when they wear out I will be buying more
My daughter got these for me for my birthday. I love them! They feel great in your hand. The spatulas are not too bendy (the thing I hate most about silicone utensils). There seems to be a solution for every cooking need in this one container! And the container is pretty too!
"Exactly as described ... well made, great quality, modern look, fabulous price! I don't recommend dish washing because it makes the wood handles dry. A+"
I just bought new cookware so I treated myself to silicone utensils instead of those nylon ones. I am very impressed. These are so well made. Sturdy wood handles and durable silicone is great. These will definitely last a very long time. I bought teal to match my new cookware so the color is vivid and true. I am so please with these.
"Great set! Came on time, packaged nicely, good price! I was a bit skeptical because of the other review said theirs broke but I've used most of them for every day cooking: eggs, pasta, meatballs ect. and they are doing great! Only thing I don't like is they arn't as dark as the picture but I wasn't going for just looks! I would recommend!"
I wanted these but my wife didn't. But now she loves them as much as I do! One of those purchases you're really glad you made. We use them daily.
I love the sturdiness and color of these! The only issue I have is after washing there is a residue the appears. I exclusively hand wash and use hot water to wash off all soap but there is always some kind of residue. It is not enough to return them or stop using just more of an annoyance.
Great product! Works well with my ceramic pots and pans. My bf was washing dishes and he let a pot soak with water and left the spatula in the water and it caused the wood to swell. So please don't leave these in water for hours our your handle will become cracked.
"Easy 5-star review. Cooking utensils are sturdy and feel durable. I shall be optimistic this is an indication of its long-term durability. If not, I'll update this review. Love the color and assortment of utensils provided. Right out of the box the utensils had that ""brand new"" silicone smell. Ran the utensils through a quick cycle in our dishwasher and the silicone smell went away. Absolutely LOVE these utensils!"
"Only had these utensils for a couple of weeks, but impressed with the quality of them. I have used them to fry, saute and other cooking uses with no issues so far. I have only hand washed these items to keep the wood handles in good shape. The wood handles are solid and have a great feel to them. I would recommend them at this early stage of ownership."
"This is a great buy! Would be useful for college students, people outfitting a second kitchen or just starting out. Nice selection of kitchen tools that look good and work well."
"I was finally able to get rid of all my miss-matched pieces. This had everything I needed for my kitchen. I love the look and feel, and the best part is that they work exactly like they are suppose to."
"Love these utensils! My favorite thing to do is cook! They work great. Great buy and would buy again, in fact I probably will just to have extra! Plus they are perfect for a wedding gift or just to give to someone who loves too cook. And they are easy to clean, which is awesome, I do suggest hand washing."
"This collection of spatulas is well worth the money. They are a lovely color. Because there are many sizes in the collection, you always have one when you need a spatula. The price for five was the same as some single spatulas. I highly recommend."
"Just what I needed and have been looking for. These pieces all work great for me as the sizes are great not too large like some spatulas and turners. Heat resistant, don‚Äôt melt like my old nylon ones and wash up easily. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in some time."
"Just received them. Put them in the dishwasher, held up well. I like the variety of sizes and styles of the set. Plus, my kitchen is red/black and so they match great!"
Very good quality and perfect color.
The different sizes are excellent for doing various tasks.
I use them in my kitchen for make batters.
Nice addition to my kitchen utensils. Sturdy and lightweight.
"I use these all the time on my non-stick pans. Hold great in heat, very easy to clean."
What a great addition to my kitchen tools! It was so satisfying to ‚Äúwipe‚Äù a bowl clean of the sauce I made and not lose a drop. Clean up was super easy.
"I really like that I had a choice of colors - I chose orange silicone with black handles. I read some reviews that said the silicone wasn‚Äôt stiff enough. For me, I like the flexibility, that they bend to the curves of the container I am scrapping. I use them to stir the contents of a pan on the stove, so yes, they are heat resistant. And they are easy to clean. Yup, I‚Äôm totally satisfied!"
"Versatile set for function. I like orange. These spatulas are a shade of orange that is like pumpkin pie, not like the orange cones in a construction zone."
I opened these and instantly threw out the old mix match spatulas I had. Put them in a cute white vase next to the stove . The handle are a tiny bit shorter than I would have liked but I'm happy with the modern color and the combo of sizes works for all my kitchen needs!!! Would definitely get these for the cook in your famiy.
"My last set had a beautiful, ergonomic wooden handle, broad spatula and were great‚Ä¶ Until the cracking began about 2 years in. I love making delicate patisserie and cook/bake on the daily, so having a good spatula set is SUPER IMPORTANT to me. While these are much smaller, they are pretty decent. I hope they last a long time. I won‚Äôt buy them again but I‚Äôm not mad about their functionality. If they had ONE in the set that was just a bit bigger, more durable (and less tacky) handles and less dang plastic waste, I would make these my entire personality."
Very nice but are darker than the sale pictures
They worked well to scape food from sides of container. But used one after the blender was turned off and the blender blade cut the tip off
I liked everything about them.
Like the spatulas very much. Would order them again!
"They're pretty beefy. They show up puzzled into a very tiny box. But, they're normal sized and mildly thick. They don't show any signs of melting after being used with my cast iron. The one long skinny spatula doesn't indent. Otherwise, they're perfect for my needs."
So far they have been ok. Not so sure they are going to be able to hold up long in this house though. Two of them already feel like they are going to break on the inside. I have the multi color set and the blue one already made an odd crack sound. As if the silicone is not fully attached to the handles. Another thing to note is if you are used to ones that are more on the stiff side you might be a bit disappointed. The long red one and the green ones are the stiffest but all three others have plenty of give to them so I have to be careful what I use them for. While I like the variety and colors of this set I will only be using them as back ups not to replace my everyday ones because I am not confident they would hold up.
"These are decent spatulas for the price ($12.99/5), but they're not the best quality. The handles on these spatulas are hollow and feel cheap and brittle in hand. I think that I will end up snapping them after a couple of months of use.  As well as poor handles, most of the spatulas are very flexible, making it difficult to scrape a bowl clean. Frustratingly enough, I was most excited for the jar spatula only to find that it's too stiff to maneuver in jars! The smallest spatula works quite well for this task though.  Overall, this is a good, affordable set for a beginning cook or baker. If you're an experienced baker who prefers stiffer spatulas, I would recommend skipping them."
"This is a very versatile set of spatulas, with every possible shape and size to meet most kitchen needs. The quality is decent given the low price and I particularly like the skinny red one for small jars. I use these daily in my kitchen for cooking and baking and am happy with their performance."
I managed to get this set on sale and I am very happy I did. There is a nice variety of sizes and they are all excellent quality. I have used them to make all kinds of things including caramel and stir frys. They hold up great to heat and are easily cleaned in the dishwasher.
"Great spatula set. They haven‚Äôt melted so that says a lot. I‚Äôve left it in the pot while cooking and nothing happened to it. Great for spreading mayo, butter, mixing for anything really. They are easy to clean and they are not flimsy like other spatulas I‚Äôve had in the past."
"Finding ourselves in need of some new kitchen tools, when I saw these available on Vine, I requested them and here we are. This review is for: Silicone Spatula Set of 5,High Temperature Resistant, Food Grade Silicone, Dishwasher Safe, for baking...  Even though this color does not match my kitchen decor, I like it. The spatulas themselves are not as stiff as I had hoped, but they're fine. The photo I attached to this review shows them after a few runs through the dishwasher and they seem to be standing up well to normal wear and tear.  Overall, these spatulas are pretty to look at and functional."
"My preference is the smaller ones. Most are very handy and the narrow red one I use daily. Love that one! The softness of the blue ones has me working harder to stir than I feel it should be. They may be heat resistant, but stirring anything hot and thick, the larger ones are not as efficient. Yes, easy to clean, so a 'point' there. Overall the smaller ones saved the day for me."
"I was needing a new spatula for scraping down bowls when baking and I really like this new set. I like that these are heat resistant so I can also use them for making scrambled eggs and other cooking. I got the orange color and they‚Äôre a bit darker than the image on my computer screen. It‚Äôs like a pumpkin orange, or canned pumpkin color. Still pretty, just a little darker."
I use a lot of spatulas and mine were getting warn so I was happy to replace them with this set. They work well and scrape sauces from the pan well. I'm a satisfied chef!
"Recently started baking and this set has been a perfect addition to my supplies. Durable, pretty color and a spatula for every use! Highly recommended"
Nice little set with color colors. All are flexible except the red one. Theybare easy tonwash and heat resistant. Can be given as a gift.
They work well and wash well. No discoloration or anything yet.
"These are cute, and a great product. A size for everything"
Love the green color. Matches my kitchen.
These are exactly what I was looking for - work great!
"The set it okay. I have mixed feelings about the set. I do love the narrow ones. They are great for scraping out the last of jelly or whatever, in a jar. I am disappointed in the bigger ones. The silicone ends are not as strong as I like. They work fine for stirring but do not work well on things such as mixing a thicker dough. They aren't stiff enough and tend to skim over the dough instead of mixing it."
Great purchase
They work with my new pans
"I find that we use smaller spatulas quite a lot. The ones we had were looking pretty rough, or missing altogether. This set was just as expected and seems to be working out well so far. Even the ""large"" sizes here really aren't that large, and this was just what I was looking for, but if you're wanting an assortment with some really big spatulas, this may not be what you're looking for."
It's great
Very sturdy. Variety of sizes. Great for use in the kitchen.
Didn't use them. The product is really small. More for a child to use.
"Not too floppy, not too stiff. Although new, they seem like a quality product."
Love different sizes - great for stirring hot items as well as cleaning out jars. Would definitely buy these again !
I like that it works
My last favorite spatula fell behind the fridge. I have been looking for a good set to replace it. This set ‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm loving completely! It‚Äôs firm but yet a little flexible. Perfect for the Mayo jars etc. totally tickled I got them!!!
I love these. Look great and easy to clean
Perfect set Love the warranty that comes with them. Didn‚Äôt have to use it but nice to know there‚Äôs one

"I'm a busy bachelor, and this food scooper is one of the best purchases I have made this year. I went for 9-years scraping eggs and pancakes and bacon from my skillet with my spreading knife (it's a great skillet and a great spreading knife, some other review). Now, that I am an owner of a spatula breakfast is far more efficient with less anxiety, and I no longer scratch my beautiful Teflon coated skillet. Where to hang this spatula in my tiny ‚Äúkitchenarium‚Äù is my next challenge, maybe next year?"
"It's ridiculous that there are so many spatulas that cost so much more than this one but they aren't as good. IThese have a nice fine edge that gets underneath foods that require a little precision - like flipping a thin layer of egg when making an omelette or getting underneath a pancake.They're safe for non stick, but I use them on my stainless steel pans also. This looked like my 10 year old one which finally started to shed a little after years of abuse and dishwashers, and after looking locally in quite a few large retailers I saw nothing that was an exact replacement and all were many times this price. So I ordered this Norpro and sure enough, it appeared to be pretty much the same thing I enjoyed for years. Had it for a couple of months now, using it once or twice a day, and I'm fairly certain these are a steal - in fact I ordered the jumbo version of this one (it's really long, I got it for big fish fillets) and that one is great, too. I feel like I should be ordering these like I do with shoes that I like and buy several so when they stop making them I still have spares."
Perfect light weight spatula. Just the thing for non-stick coated skillets. Like that the end is beveled and slips under meat or eggs easily for turning. It's just the right length for my hand and height and I like the width and length of the turner portion. Sometimes they are to long and skinny. Did you ever notice that the solid non-slotted ones allow your food to slide right off the spatula and you're fighting to get the food out of the skillet or off the cooking sheet? I don't get those anymore and like the slotted ones instead because the food is more likely to be caught between a slot and stay on the spatula if it starts to slide. An important piece of info-I know.
"How important can an egg flipper be? Well, pretty important for me since I looked for years for one close to my current. The length of the handle, the angle of the edge, the size of the paddle are reasons this makes a perfect feel to get under and flip that egg just right.... and don't forget plenty of BUTTER (yea, my heart's in the south)  The added benefit is the handle is molded in as one piece, so you won't deal with the handle eventually sliding off and getting water, gunk (glue etc) on your towels etc.  Heat resistant? I don't know; I don't leave it in a hot skillet to find out"
"I use this for all my spatula needs right now though I plan to get a heavy-duty metal spatula for my cast iron pans so I can heavily scrape them smooth inside. I recommend this. It works well in my InstantPot pressure cookers to scrape up any browning or sticking items without scratching it. It's comfortable to use, durable so far, and does the job. I don't leave utensils resting on hot pans and don't fry much, so I can't say if it would melt under those circumstances. Cooking eggs without oil on a well-seasoned cast iron pan didn't result in any melting. I recommend this spatula as an everyday item every kitchen can use."
"I wanted a basic spatula to, you know, flip stuff like pancakes and such. Not surprised this one does exactly that. Not much else you can say about a spatula. Okay yes it's easy to clean, holds up well to hot bacon grease and is easy to hold.  If you're looking for a spatula with those qualities, this one fits the bill."
"I ordered 3 different spatulas looking to replace a plastic one I accidentally melted on my cast iron griddle. This is the one closest to what I wanted. It's a good size for flipping normal sized pancakes and burgers and eggs, and has some give to it so you can push it down into a pan to slide it under your food. My one complaint is the sticker on the handle which has left glue to remove."
"So my mother had this spatula way back in the day, according to her its the best because while it's a ""cheap"" spatula it's the perfect balance of flexibility while still being durable. She had one for YEARS that she kept even though the handle snapped in half and one of the bars on the head broke and we begged her to get a new one or throw it out. But she still used it because it was her favorite and any other spatula just wasn't the same. I finally found the same one here on Amazon and now she has two new ones that replaced her old broken one. I can't say they last ""forever"" but for as cheap as it is, it's really not a bad spatula."
"Up until now, my whole life has been a lie. I always thought that I was happy, but I didn't know what happiness was until I purchased this spatula. It's as though I've come out of cold and darkness into the warm sunshine. I know what it is to fully be alive.  Ok, maybe it doesn't do all that (it's only a spatula), but it does flip eggs well and the pricing is good.  I will probably buy it again."
"This is my favorite spatula. I own three! My previous favorite spatula got melted, and I had difficulty finding one shaped like it until this one. This one is great for scrambling eggs and browning hamburger meat. The shape of the edges make it work well with frying pan corners."
"Its being slightly rounded aids in sliding under things like pancakes. I never realized this until I received this and compared to my previous spatula. The handle could be a bit more sturdy, its a liny bit bouncy. Can't beat the price for what you get. I'll buy another for when one is in the dishwasher."
My husband cooks A LOT and goes through quite a few utensils - so I'm super happy that it's sturdy & affordable! We love it because it resists the heat so much better than the ones we've had in the past. I hated picking and scraping off food AND melted plastic bits. It's definitely a good product!
"I have tried many types. The thin nylon are the best for flipping eggs. Yes, you cannot just let it lay on a hot pan or it will melt. You have to be smart enough to know how to use any kitchen equipment or appliance. Love it"
"I really like this spatula. I bought 2 total. I‚Äôm a full time college student renting my room nearby campus. So basically I started out with no kitchen items and had to buy the basics. I like this spatula so much more than the cheapie one I got from a dollar store - it doesn‚Äôt scratch the nonstick finish on my fry pans, it is very easy to rinse off and clean, and it‚Äôs durable (doesn‚Äôt melt or burn if it touches a hot pan). I recommend this basic spatula for every kitchen!"
"ive only used once so ill update if any more pros or cons come up.  to me the handle is not ""non-skid"". it does have a thumb grip but thats all which is not really a con because i had no problem with it trying to slip out of my hands  its not flimsy it cleans super easy by hand so i cant comment on if any dishwasher problems  maybe its just me but i feel like the angle of the spatula is great. i felt like it made it easy to get under what i was cooking with ease and around the edges of the pan i didnt fling food out trying to get under it or move it around"
Actually bought it as a prop for our Bob‚Äôs Burgers couples costume and then implemented it in to our family of kitchen instruments. It‚Äôs been very nice and sturdy over the years.
The spatula is light and has a nice feel. It does not harm non stick pans and griddles. Good buy.
"Local spatula's were way over priced $10+ for a spatula at a discount place? Sure Wallyworld has some flimsy ones for cheaper, but I wanted one that didn't feel like it was going to snap in half when you picked up a pancake with it. this spatula has been great so far. Works well, food doesn't stick to it, and it cleans easily. A good buy for the $4 and change I paid."
I've been using this at least a couple of times a week for a couple of years now and it's held up great. It's the perfect size flipper for me. 1/23/2018- I just recently bought 2 more of these to have as backups for when the first one breaks. It's still holding up very well for how much use it gets. It's really not a heavy duty one but it works great for everything I need it to do. I highly recommend it.
"There are dozens and dozens of these out there. Who know it would be so complicated to find the perfect spatula? After looking at the reviews, I settled on this one. Yes, it is a simple tool, but an important tool. I use it a lot with my Cast Iron skillets. I will probably get another one someday, but this one works well enough for now."
"This is the new favorite for my wife and I. We actually race to get to use it, the shape and feel are perfect for us and our cookware. Rounded shape makes it great for getting into the corners while scrambling eggs or tossing pasta.  We have only had it to cook 4 or meals but we have revises the menu just to be able to use this.  Good heat resistance too. Laid on edge of skillet and forgot about it and didn't melt. (A more expensive spatula we have did, we are bad about that)."
"Love this spatula. I hate thick spatulas that you can't get under an egg without breaking the yolk. I hate flimsy spatula that sag when you try and flip something. This one is great! Has a nice weight to it, not too thick, has a nice edge to slide under delicate things...I bought 5 of them (wanted a couple for our camper too)"
"I have quite of few non-stick spatulas -- but this is my favorite one and I need to buy maybe 6 more. This one doesn't flip flop around, it's small enough but strong enough to flip burgers on the grill or an omelette. Highly recommended by me."
"My old spatula broke and thought I would be disappointed with any replacement. However, this turned out to be a great find. I use it almost every day and completely thrilled with the quality and feel in my hand."
"This was exactly what I was looking for. Needed to replace one that melted on the leading edge while cooking zucchini. Don‚Äôt know about heat resistance yet, but looks and feels just right."
"Nothing wrong with the quality, just has a pretty small head. No problem for scrambling eggs or stirring something, but flipping pancakes or anything with a diameter of more than 4"" would probably be a problem."
"I mainly purchased this to use in a little 9"" pan to make omlettes in. It fits perfect to come in from the side to flip the omlette in half. Fits in the top of my dishwasher too. I like it!"
It is the best non metal spatula she has used. Most are too thick or too flimsy. She likes it as well as her metal spatula with no fear of damaging non stick cookware. Durability is excellent and should last a long time.
Use for eggs and burgers on a griddle. Does the job.
"I had a couple of plastic spatulas, but they were a tad thick for pancakes. this one has a thin edge which is what I was looking for."
I cook 3 meals a day and this is my absolute favorite spatula of the 4 I own. I definitely recommend it and just came back to order another.
"The spatula is nicer than I even expected. Such a nice small size for the small skillet, especially the stone finished non-stick kind. Great for small areas and spaces, or even if you've got a big kitchen. I cook nearly every meal that we eat, so I'm in the kitchen a lot. I very highly recommend this little spatula. I love it!"
"Have used and cleaned in dishwasher several times, has held up well. Wish the flat section was wider but product is as described. Its longevity to be determined."
I liked the size.
"I somehow didn't notice or realize how big 13"" is. It's GREAT making something that needs to be stirred in a large skillet or dutch oven (jambalya), but not great for scrambling one egg in my small skillet for breakfast. For what it is it is a very good product - comfortable handle, cleans almost as easily as my non=stick skillet, hope it proves to be durable."
"Picked up two of these, to replace some under-performing spatulas (one of which was too thin, and the other had gotten a melted edge).  Have been cooking with them regularly for several weeks now, and they've been holding up well! They have no trouble getting underneath burgers, eggs, and bacon for flipping."
I use. it to fry eggs and french fries i havent use it yet but its probably a good spatuala
But these things are cheap and over easy.... just like my eggs
Great item at a great price
Works great. It‚Äôs a good piece of item to use in your kitchen
"I purchased this product to use with my new Presto Electric Skillet and it is the perfect size for the 11"" skillet I just purchased; they were ordered at the same time. Not only works well on the skillet, but also in my stainless steel cookware and various other skillets. The rounded sides lets you get under whatever you are cooking and lifts out whatever you are cooking easily without breaking or dropping. Thinking about ordering another one for my beach house. I recommend and would purchase again."
"It seems like we all have that one sad, melted spatula that pretty much exists to keep the utensils drawer from opening. This feels less bendy. I just got it so can't speak to heat resistance over time, but it is tangibly heftier than other plastic spats I've had. My cooking utensils get a lot of use so I'm hoping it doesn't get those crumbly melted bits at the tip (that I pretend I don't notice but are probably providing some uninvited seasoning to my eggs.) Thanks for a simple design."
Melted my other one in a pan we‚Äôll see how long this one lasts LOL
"I purchased the 13 incher as an add on item. I wasn't looking for a spatula, but Amazon popped up an ad and I bought it. it does what it supposed to do. If you need this size then but it. If you don't like it then there is no big loss."
wut ya tink it do...go head be adventurous ..kin alway ask de neighbor how to make it work
great tool
This was an add on for $4.00 with minimum purchase so I purchased 2 higher end spatulas and this on is way ahead of the expensive one
"I can't get excited and endlessly gush about a spatula, so suffice it to say that I'm quite happy with this one."
"BEST SPATULA IVE USED !!! What a great price also üòÄ. Buy one, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
Perfect size and good quality. My last one exactly like this I literally had for over 10 years and this appears to be the exact same so I am very happy with this spatula purchase
It is sturdy and cleans up well. I have been using it daily on a cast iron pan with my home fries.
"Great spatula. I bought one, then bought a second a few months later."
"great looking, great quality, easy to clean, easy to use on non stick pans, great price"
"Just what I needed, quick delivery and the price was right"
"I was using this great-big flapjack turner for my eggs. Sometimes, my cooked eggs would slip away down the side of the stove, or onto the floor. One time, they ended up in my dogs bowl. Now, this handy egg turner is precise and well balanced. Sorry mutt!"
Nice and sturdy had it on high heat by mistake and plastic didn‚Äôt melt at all and easy to get food off of for the price definitely a plus
"I like the fact that it‚Äôs all one piece, easy to use, easy to clean and fairly strong."
"Seems and feels sturdy, I‚Äôve bought from this brand in store and so far it‚Äôs a good product so far."
Sometimes food can be hard to get out of the ends of the slots but overall a good spatula.
Easy to use.
Great to use when cooking pretty much anything. Very strong and doesn't melt or scrape anything.
"Just what I was looking for; basic, adaquit size, stiff, heat resistant, thin enough for pancakes and eggs. Fits in my utensil drawer nicely (no bulky handle)."
STURDY AND GREAT PRICE
We've had this spatula for a couple of years and have no complaints. It hasn't melted yet or started shedding plastic the way spatulas often do when exposed to very high temperatures.
Bought two of these. Price is good and they work amazing on griddles and skillets. Would definitely recommend.
Fine for my nonstick cookware and less expensive than the other brand
Perfect for non-stick pans. Sturdy and does the job a spatula should.
"They are sturdier than I expected, but still not like a metal one. Very great product, especially for the price."
Norpro Nylon Nonstick 13 inch Slotted Spatula is perfect for smaller kitchen drawers. Sturdy and easy to clean.
So far so good. No scratches on the cooking surfaces. No heat transfer.
"I bought this pan to make omelettes for one (me). It's a wonderful size, not too big, not too small, and has what seems to be a very durable non-stick coating. The coating itself is flecked with white , like the old blue metal mugs and bowls that makes people think of the days of the California Gold Rush and people crying out ""There's gold in them thar' hills!"". I love it. Although I shall make the omelettes in my modern kitchen on my gas stove, in Manhattan, I will feel like I'm cooking over a campfire in the Sierra Nevadas ."
"Every bit as good as the higher priced OXO brand... maybe better, since my last OXO separated at the blade tip after a couple of years."
"I LOVE this spatula and it has become my new favorite/go to spatula. Eggs I've made do not stick to it, like other spatulas, and the tip is thin enough that it slides right under fried eggs I've made. No doubt it'll do the same when I make homemade cookies. I only hope the price drops back to $6.99 so I can order 2 or 3 more. I've only owned it for 3 weeks now though so, hopefully it'll never fall apart. Will update this post and my score if it does, but for now, it deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it."
This has a large surface and makes flipping things easy
"I bought a plastic spatula at the box store and It was too thick and stuck to things. Silicone won't stick right? Well, it does somewhat and it's still too thick to get under most stuff. I am beginning to hate teflon skillets. They all seem to be made for stir fry or something with those nasty curved sides and the simple task of flipping a burger has been rendered almost impossible The spatula won't get under it and it just slides right out of the skillet. What wonderful progress we have made. I'm going back to cast iron skillets and very thin stainless spatulas."
"I've always been a bit disappointed with the nylon spatulas because they never seem to last. Even though one might be rated for quite a high temperature, it slowly starts to wear away. I thought I would try this based on the reviews. So far, no sign of wear whatsoever on this product. I have used it lots of times over a few months now and I am very satisfied. I would definitely recommend it."
"A little bigger than most,"
"This works great for just about everything, it is not very sharp so cutting things is a hassle if you're trying to break up like, hamburger, or cut mushrooms as you're cooking them down, but everything else works like a charm. I really enjoy using it, it's helped in the kitchen as our previous one started to break."
Very nice spatula although I would go for the larger size if you are more of a person who is making larger meals and bigger proportion sized foods.
"I‚Äôve used this spatula for various uses and have found it to be very helpful. Using it to pick up baked sticky items, not only does it lift it easy but because the edge is thin and flexible, you can easily get it under the items and they slip right off without leaving anything on the spatula!! Cleaning is very easy and fast."
"First off, be aware that this is a large spatula. I bought this in hopes of having a solid replacement for a previous one I liked. However, one thing to note is that this spatula will bend if you push too hard. Other than that, the spatula is great quality, a little flexible but will not melt in the heat at all."
"I should have pulled out the measuring tape to really get a sense of what I was ordering. The larger spatula would be perfect for pancakes, but it a bit big for more precise work. Since the quality was so good, I just ordered the smaller size."
"Bought this to replace a nylon spatula that melted. I should have paid closer attention to the measurement in the description. Four inches is VERY wide - too wide for flipping an egg in a small skillet. I'll try again with the 3"" spatula!"
"I was looking for a large spatula, and this is definitely it. It is larger than my old large spatula, and the edge is slim enough that it slides easily under an egg so I can flip it without breaking. It isn't scratching my new t-fal non-stick pan, either."
"I like the feel of the handle. Because there‚Äôs no slits in it, it‚Äôs kind of hard to flip eggs, I think it will work better for pancakes. I wish I would‚Äôve looked at the picture better before purchasing. It‚Äôs a little expensive for a flipper."
This spatula has an easy yet safe heat-resistant grip. It is flexible when it needs to be. Cleaning is a breeze.
"Very happy with this spatula! It‚Äôs made flipping eggs a lot easier! And it works great with tortillas, too. So far has been able to withstand high temperatures, has not melted or anything."
Wasn't what I was expecting. Pretty flimsy.... So I just use it for my pancakes on the griddle. It's big enough for them and it's light duty work. Feels like anything more and it will break.
I truly hope this Silicone Spatula is the best available! I have used it twice & no sticking! It‚Äôs large but still easy to flip fried eggs! The Reviews sounded great as well!
Way too big and bulky for omelet
Item is heavier than I expected. Holding up well so far. Blade is slightly flimsy at the tip. If food is stuck to the pan it will not get it off without using a sturdier or wooden spatula.
I like the size but am a little disappointed that pancake batter sticks to the bottom when flipping. I think I read somewhere it was non-stick which it is not.
"Silicone ""grips"" the cooking pan and will not easily slide under food to be turned. Too thick, really, to easily slide under fried eggs."
Did not expect just how useful the flex spatula has bern! Rated average for sturdiness as it designed to flex! Iuse it everday
"Good for not scratching cookware. The edge is not as thin as my prior silicone spatula, but I anticipate this one won't get a tear like the last one did. I would recommend this one."
"Its dumb how the grip very easily melts, and get damaged. It defeats the point of having a heat resistant spatula."
"I was looking for a spatula that was flexible enough to get up under eggs at the side of a round pan, but doesn‚Äôt fall apart. This works great! Replaces a different silicone spatula that was falling apart. I like that the edge is flexible but the center is sturdy"
"All of our other spatulas have had melting issues when left in the pan for an extended period, this is nice and stiff , sturdy and durable"
Good quality for money. This is the smaller size of 2 that I use more often. Buy the other also!
I used this once and it flipped my pancakes as it was supposed to.
Returned. Too stiff to flip pancakes.
Good front edge gets under food in frying pan. Easy clean up
Finally found a tough non metal spatula
Handle a bit flimsy but I can live with that. So easy to clean! I will buy another.
Works great for griddle work. Easy cleanup. Will order again.
Makes cooking fish easy. It's extra wide & flexible.
Item as described.
Nice big surface.
It is well made!
"This product used in cooking on ceramic & non-stick pans to prevent any scratches, it glides easily when turning food; I plan on buying product for my adult children too."
"They are well made, hold us to heat as advertised and look great in my kitchen."
Works great..
The product is really working out well. I'm impressed.
Great all purpose spatula
Great product!
"Sturdy turner and very handy to use, superb heat resistance."
It's a spatula. It doesn't scratch my ceramic griddle. It's big enough to flip a pancake.
"1st time using the spatula, was making grilled cheese sandwiches on below medium heat,noticed black smudges on pan.Was plastic burnt on pan from spatula.Terrible product"
Excellent product
Needs to be more sturdy material for use.
I wish it was a bit more sturdy but it works !
Larger than I expected.Fried potatoes.
Great spatula. And a bit larger than I realized.
"I especially like the thin, yet very sturdy, base that easily glides under food. Easily flips eggs as well as thick hamburgers."
This really does the job for me.
"Heavy than expected, very pleased for the price"
works great
Showed up scratched and dirty
Good value. Dishwasher friendly. Fast delivery
Size of the paddle is good for small as well as large pans.
It works but it's ugly and unnecessarily thick.
Its a very durable and xtra large flipper.
All I expected
Sturdy
poop spatula
FLEXABILITY PRICE
Well made
"Why isn't the handle made of the same material as the spatula itself? They're designed to look exactly the same but aren't. Disappointed that the heat melted a crease into the handle. Was on the edge of a frying pan for only 5 seconds or so. So much for the Gorilla Grip name which implies toughness, guess not. Overall it's a good spatula but if you need a firm edge you won't get it here. It's somewhat flimsy which is fine for many things except things like squeezing down a burger while cooking or using the edge to cut or divide something."
"I am tired of nylon spatulas melting, so I looked for a larger silicone one. So many were small (length), this was not and it is perfect for pancakes! I highly recommend this, the size in the description is spot on, it's got a large surface area, but it was the length I wanted, I highly recommend it and it can easily be your one unslotted spatula!"
It is sturdy yet pliable enough to be a bit flexible. The handle design affords a nice comfortable grip.
"I liked the product, easy to clean. Case is also a big factor. I gave one as a gift and they loved it as well."
I like the one piece construction and they are not too flimsy.
"Liked the zippered storage container. Find utensils sturdy, easy to clean and match kitchen decor!"
I bought them because it was on sale and I'm planning to move out. It is very sturdy and I believe it's worth the price.
They are amazing!
"I wanted the variety (although I don't need the case) and while some people mentioned that they thought they were not sturdy enough, I find that I actually love the flexibility of them in scraping out bowls and such. Nothing gets left behind. Glad I found them!"
"The internal part that is stiff doesn‚Äôt extend long enough. When you put any pressure on the spatulas, you can see the silicone turn to a lighter color, which indicates to me these will not last long with regular use."
"I use these products for my soap, lotion and candle business. They are absolutely perfect"
The largest spatula snapped in half while mixing thick food products
"Nice set, but smaller than expected."
It was perfect
So far these utensils have been really handy to use on my cookware and not scratch them up. Also I can get in crevices to help get all the food out for cleaning or just not wasting food at meal times.
A tool for all your baking needs and super easy to clean
"Perfect to move to a new small appartment: nice sturdy case and convenient assortment of silicone tools with no seams between handle and silicone tip - Easy to clean and very sleek and modern (got mine in black). My nicest set of silicone spatulas so far and will not change color over time due to the black color. The case can be used for pens, or other small electronics. Price point is excellent at $8.99 but the 82% discount (from $49.98 to $8.99) is a strange marketing strategy."
This silicone spatula set is perfect! Each tool is sturdy and made really well. They don‚Äôt bend and turn white in the area like cheaper ones tend to do. They are heat resistant and great tools for protecting cookware. I love to use them for preparing baked items because these work great at stirring and scraping all the of the batter from the sides of the bowl. They easy to clean and come in a nice storage case that will be great when go on trips!

"Helpful utensil set comes with everything I was looking for and then some. I ordered this set to add to our camping gear, so it's especially helpful that it comes with a carrying case so all the utensils can stay together in one spot. So far they hold up to heat well while using them with my kitchen stove. Easy to clean too. I was just hoping they'd be a little larger, but not a huge deal."
These spatulas are really well made. They are sturdy and will hold up to heat. They are a one piece design which means no food left up under the head of the spatula. They are easy to clean with just soap and water. They even come with their own storage case so they won't get lost in the drawer. I highly recommend these spatulas. I hope you found this review helpful.
"This is a nice set of silicone spatulas! They come in a nice zippered case, too. I washed them all on my top rack of my dishwasher and they held up nice. The tips bend when you press down, if that matters to you. I ordered these because it always seems like mine is dirty when I need it so I'm glad to have so many now!"
"Upgraded fromapatualas that keep having to pull top off to dry out fully. Good variety of sizes and usefulness. Inner support is strong and supportive, not right at edge. This should help prevent cheap having metal break through at corners. Very happy."
This set arrives individually wrapped in plastic zipped inside the storage pouch. Everything about it is great quality. It works well. It is comfortable to hold. It cleans easily. The zipper on the pouch is strong and works easily. We recommend this.
Very nice set of silicone spatulas that come with a carrying case. I will be getting rid of my old ones and replacing with these. These are a lot better than the ones in stores. It is a thicker silicone that stands up to a lot of use.
"Presentation of these silicone spatulas is amazing. They arrived a beautiful travel case, not sure what this would be used for but none the less they arrived in this case. Looking forward to using these. Update to follow"
"I almost took away a star because these are a bit smaller than some other options but realized that the minor size change offers additional flexibility with limited downsides  You get 5 kitchen tools for basting, flipping, spreading, stirring, and mixing. The seamless design makes these super easy to clean and the silicone repels water for quick drying after washing.  Each tool is well designed and has decent heft. These should last for some time.  While the included case seems lends towards using these when camping or in a RV, there is really no reason this set can‚Äôt be used as a primary set at home."
"Perfect kit. Love the silicone feel. Work well, especially with high heat! Easy to clean and store. These are great to take camping too and all fit in the travel patch it comes with."
"I love silicone spatulas. While this set has a little more flex than I would like (better units have a longer steel core extending into the spatula body), none do it at this price point. For this price, this is an excellent set. The included case makes it easy to store. I think this would be best suited for camping because of that case. If you want heavy duty you'll pay for it. That's what I would use for scraping up scrambled eggs at an angle while cooking, the heavier duty spatulas flex less and do better. If you just want some basic silicone spatulas and can stand a little more flex you just can't beat this set for the price."
""
This is a really nice se and it comes with a storage bag. Not sure I have a use for a storge bag for them. They feel really well made and work great!
This Silicone Spatulas Set is well made. I‚Äôve already thrown away my old set. They come in a nice case too. I trust I will get years of use from this set.
These have been excellent! Great quality. Dishwasher fine. I especially love that there is no gaudy brand emblem on each piece.
"A bit shorter than I expected, but great quality. Very soft silicone, no bad smell and easy to use. Cleaned in dishwasher and no problem. Overall satisfied."
"I needed another set of silicon spatulas as I use them everyday and to avoid washing them to use again, I got another set. These spatulas are so very versatile in the kitchen whether you are baking, cooking, stirring, cleaning out bowls, etc. Sturdy and well made and they come in it's own zipper case! Love it! No more hunting for the right spatula as they are in their case. Also the red color stands out amongst the other kitchen gadgets I have. Very nice set!"
"I have a set of similar silicone spatulas, I love them and use them daily. I use them for everything from scrambling eggs to scraping jars. If you've never used a silicone basting brush, I highly recommend one over a bristle brush. This set has all of the sizes for every chore. Dishwasher safe too. Great for crafting, making soaps, lotions, or candles, and even has a nice case to put them all in. I ordered this set as a gift."
"I could not believe all 6 pieces fit tidily into the case and hardly took up any room in the drawer. Yet all work as designed and are sturdy. They will not scratch. You can get every bit of batter out and into the cooking dish, scrape out the last bit of jelly or honey, and the sizes are just right for big or small jobs. Bright red color makes the case easy to spot in the drawer."
"Very nice set of silicone utensils. They are dishwasher safe and heat resistant, a great added set to my kitchen. In fact, I'm replacing my old silicone pieces with these new ones. And they come come in a nice zippered case. At fifty dollars I would say they are over-priced, but with the significant discount now being offered they're an actual bargain. Good quality."
"This is a nice spatula set that's well made and easy to clean. I've used it with cast iron and stainless steel skillets, as well as to mix cake batter. The performance met my my expectations.  The value depends on the price, which has seen some wild swings. The list price is $49.99, which is borderline preposterous. However, I've seen it as low as $8.99 on Amazon, which is a great value for this product.  If you see this set below $20 then grab it by all means. The spatulas do their job well and are easy to take care of."
"I absolutely love this set. They are heat resistant , sturdy and easy to clean."
These spatulas are made very well. The color is perfect! They work perfectly with some new pots and pans we bought. I had no problem using them for cooking hashbrowns today.
We use these almost everyday since we cook a lot. They not only work well but look great too! I like the all-black design because it goes with my modern kitchen. Highly recommend!
"These cooking tools are well made, sturdy, and easy to clean. These tools don't have the issues I've had with other tools that are similar. The design prevents separation of the tool from the handle as well as lacking crevices that are difficult to clean. The scraping spoons are strong enough to be able to mix thicker materials such as cookie dough. The spatula spreads frosting smoothly. The case fits the set nicely without being bulky."
"I bought these spatulas for my flattop and for when I use my iron skillet that sits on top of my BBQ grill. What I love about these spatulas is that they're strong enough to flip big burgers, steaks, chickens, pork chops and even fish, shrimp and eggs. I recently had a cookout and had to cook a lot of fish. What I love about these spatulas is I was able to use these on my flattop to cook everything that was on there. The fish was really the test because these did not tear or break any of the fish that I was cook. The spatulas are long enough to scoop the whole fish steak that I had and I didn't have to worry about it breaking while trying to flip it. These are really easy to wash and all of them have holes on the handles that made for hanging these on my outdoor kitchen hooks. Great for flipping really anything, even fruit and vegetables that I used on my grill. Another great feature, they don't bend."
""
These are just what I was looking for. They are a good weight and balanced. The sharp edges of the spatulas will make it easy to break up or dice softer vegetables or to brown meats in a skillet. This set is well worth the money. I recommend them.
These were ordered for me by my wife. Unfortunately I wanted a set to BBQ with. These are too short for that. I almost kept them for the kitchen though. (That is her domain). I gave them a five because I was so tempted to keep them even though I didn't need them.
"Lightweight, wish they were a little heavier"
Just what I wonted
"At about 15 bucks for the set, you simply can't beat them. They seem much more expensive. Very well made and sturdy with nice real wood handles quite firmly attached. The quality seems far above the price and you get three very useful and different spatulas. I've seen one of these going for at least $30 elsewhere. Very happy with the purchase. It's almost like how can you go wrong at this price?!"
"I thought this was going to be a nice little set to have. However after only a couple of weeks, the large spatula has already started to rust. If this is actually stainless, it is the cheapest stainless I've ever seen. Very disappointed"
Washed in dishwasher. All stain came off handle and wood is now very rough and splinters.
Slightly flimsy
Rivets are coming apart on the handles. Dissappointing.
This set is just what I needed to replace old metal spatulas. Very sturdy and high quality. Good value.
These are good but the handle gets loose pretty quickly
All spatulas are tiny. Useless for grill as they are too short. Useless for real kitchen as the edges are thick. Save your money.. not worth returning.
Will not buy again
"I needed to get a new metal spatula after my last one's handle broke. It was undeniably flimsy so I wanted to make sure the next one would last. And this set is extremely sturdy.  My main desire was to have the handle itself to be sturdy, and not hollow. This set is wooden and solid, and I was surprised upon holding and first use how hefty and heavy it was. They work great for cooking. Upon using on my carbon steel, I could feel instantly how well they would be for a grill.  $15 is a great price for this set, and on first use could tell the quality was worth it and more."
They are great and heavy duty
"I have been suffering with spatulas that are to thick and rounded to turn an egg. Finally found these. The fish spatula is handy for all sorts of things. I never use ""nonstick"" cookware, so I am happy with thin, somewhat flexible metal."
Cooking eggs on a griddle.
love them
"I love these. They are sturdy but yet iron is relatively thin, which is nice."
These flipper things work very well with all my cooking needs.
Bien et pratique. Mais attention √† ne pas l‚Äôutiliser dans une po√™le vous allez rayer instantan√©ment votre rev√™tement. C‚Äôest vraiment plus pour les plats en verre ou autres r√©cipients sans rev√™tement dedans. Ou le barbecue / plancha.
Really good quality. Will last a lifetime.
Great quality and workmanship for any kitchen enthusiast.
"After researching many spatula reviews, I decided to go with Di Oro because of their high ratings and their lifetime warranty. One of the 3 spatulas in the set I purchased started tearing after about 8 months of heavy use (the set quickly became our go to spatulas). I reached out to Di Oro's customer service and they responded within 12 hours. The information they requested was easy to provide, order #, picure of the damaged product and where they should ship the replacement. Within 5 days of my initial email, we received our brandy new spatula. In my opinion, standing by your product and making the process simple and quick is definitely the way to maintain a loyal customer! I will continue to look for products to purchase from this company."
"They have the flaw that is mentioned in several reviews, the silicone comes off the corners, and the flat metal blade suddenly pokes through and destroys your non-cook pans. There are lots of ""Oh customer service just sent me new ones under the life time warranty"" comments. Love to see how that happens as they've been completely non responsive to me after logging to their website. Just don't expect a lot a life out of these, or expect to chase customer service for replacements.  UPDATE: Still no response from website weeks later. How is this product getting so many positive reviews?"
"We have been enjoying this set. It was the perfect investment to help protect our new Creuset pans. These tools are light and well balanced. They are thin enough to slide under food and strong enough to hold the weight of it it. They also clean brilliantly! After about 10 months, the small 'cookie' spatula (this one winds up being the one I use for cooking because it's small) developed a tear in the protective coating. I emailed the company, had an immediate response and request for pictures, which I sent, and they immediately sent a replacement. I love this company and will joyfully buy more of their products!"
"Some wives get insulted if you get them a gift for the kitchen or around the house. Thankfully, my wife isn't one of those. If it's a kitchen gadget, appliance, accessory, etc., then there's every chance she wants it. Recently, while doing the dishes, I noticed some of her spatulas were in need of replacing so decided to find her a nice one or two. Instead, I stumbled upon this three-piece beauty. Long story short, she loves them. They are great in her nonstick cookware, have a variety of uses, and are flexible enough, yet sturdy enough to get the job done!"
I owned these flippers for a few months now and have used them almost daily. They work great and I have thrown out my old plastic ones.  These ones are soft and will not scratch up pans. They also resist heat well. I have not noticed any melting. They are also pretty strong since there is a metal flipper inside the rubber. The smallest one is the strongest one can could actually be used to cut up soft food it is so strong. It does not bend well. The bigger ones are floppier and can bend around round corners of pans.  The flippers feel very premium and are comfortable to use. I would highly recommend purchasing them if you are willing to pay for high quality products and cook often.
I don't know why it took me so long to order these spatula's. I've been using cheap ones for years and had to deal with the melting of the tips due to high heat. This will not happen with these. I've used the large one several times already and it is great for flipping omelets because of the ability to flex just enough to conform with the side of the skillet.  I want to add one more thing. When I ordered these spatula's Amazon contacted me stating that the finish of the blade may not be right. When I received the spatula's I found that the blade color is darker toward the handle and lighter toward the tip. Not knowing if this was common I contacted Di Oro to discuss the finish of the blade. I spoke to a young lady who is the best customer service representative I ever dealt with. She insisted on sending me another set of spatula's which she did. When I received the spatula's I found the variation in color to be a little less than the first set so this must be common with all silicone turners. This is no way a reflection on quality. I will not hesitate to order more products from Di Oro. I cannot say enough about the young lady who works there. I wish all customer service representatives were as good as this one.
"""Nice product, nice weight/construction (although I do wish they made an option to purchase of seamless). I cook meats on a daily basis, when cooking ground meat items you can add a decent amount of pressure without fear of turner bending ( something I have had issues with with all previous turners) These are well made, sturdy, and have a good feel to them.... I have used all three turners (pancake, egg, cookie) and while I have been hesitant to use plastic or silicone because of the thickness & flexibility, I find neither of these to be an issue with D‚Äôorio products. Easy to get under what ever you are cooking without causing damage to what you are turning. I give this set of turners 5 stars, and believe them to be a great value for the price! "" **** update, after a few months of use, and I mean above average use, both sets, (spatulas, & turners), and being hand washed after each use, both sets still look and preform as If new just out of packaging!!!!"
"Love the size of the turners. The thinner one is perfect for eggs, hamburgers, and similar size items. The larger turner is great for nice sized pancakes or if you want to turn over larger items or more than one egg. The spatula has a slant to it which makes it easy to get around the edges of a bowl or pan. All three pieces can be put in the dishwasher or will easily wash off with just a few strokes. Especially like the fact the have a high heat resistence and do NOT SCRATCH my coated pots and pans. I previously purchased a couple of large spoons made by Di Oro, and like them so much I decided to purchase more items. So far, have not been disappointed in any of the items they make."
"Great length. Feels sturdy in your hand. Fine in the dishwasher. All around a great item and I would buy again*. It looks great and feels good to the touch. It cleans up well.  If you're just looking for Spatulas and don't care if it matches anything else, this is a good buy.  But what I want is a FULL set that matches. After buying spoons, tongs, a zester and spatulas (at a hefty total price), I forgot about (and didn't think to look for) the Pasta Spoon. Doesn't look like they have one... Had to buy one that looks 'close' from a competitor.  So now I have a BEAUTIFUL DI ORO set, with the 'odd man out' pasta spoon. Kinda ruins the look. I guess the pasta spoon goes in the drawer for now?  Had I known earlier, I might have bought from a brand that has everything, so I don't have to hide something."
"We were looking for sturdy spatulas that would not scratch our non-stick cookware, but were also dishwasher safe. These fit the bill perfectly. They are metal in the middle, which provides strength, covered thoroughly with silicon, which protects our cookware. The silicon is bonded tightly enough with the metal that water doesn't get between them, even in the dishwasher. We are very happy with them!"
"I just received these today and of course had to try them tonight. I used the smallest one with the ground beef I cook daily and loved it  The overall feel of these is very sturdy and they're heavy, which is a nice feel in comparison to my drawer of cheaper spatulas.  I have a little reservation as to how long the silicone coating/sleeve around the metal will last with frequent use, but only time will tell. And I'll be back to share an update in a few weeks or months regarding that.  These are definitely something I would recommend to a friend or even buy for a house warming gift."
"Hard to get excited about a spatula, but these really are exceptional. When I moved into a new apartment, I bought an Amazon Basics set of utensils, which included a couple of spatulas. They were terrible, with the edges melting against a hot pan simply to flip an egg or pancakes. Not wanting to ingest plastic, I bought a Farberware spatula, but they did the exact same thing. So I did some searching and saw these and decided to give them a try. Third time's a charm! No melting, nice sturdy metal blade encased in food-grade silicon, a selection of styles for different needs. I've only used them 3x so far, but am thoroughly impressed. Time will tell how durable they are, but hey, a lifetime warranty!? Get out of town!"
"Got the set of 3 spatulas. When I received them, I had never seen spatulas like these. They have a steel base throughout the handle and spatula end, and the end is wraped beyond the steel with a heat resistant silicone, so the spatula is strong and yet has a small flexy slim edge to get the food easily.  Started making pancakes, flipping eggs, making other things, and they are phenomenal!! I LOVE THESE SPATULAS!!  The 3 different sizes are perfect for almost any dish. I'll definitely buy more Di Oro items and eventually replace everything in my kitchen with what they have, their forever warranty assures it will be with us, well, forever.  Get these, you won't regret it."
"I originally received a set of these turner-spatulas as a gift. I liked them so much that I purchased another set as a gift for my niece (this is that order). The three sizes are very well thought out so that they cover a whole range of cooking functions. The metallic interiors and the silicone covers provide a great combination of functionality and heat resistance... so that is the great product part of my heading.  I can vouch that Di Oro is a very customer-friendly company, because I had the need to contact them for support as one of my spatulas developed a crack at the silicone-metal junction. They promptly mailed me a replacement after verifying the purchase and the damage. Now that is what I call a no-hassle lifetime warranty!"
"We've been purchasing the OXO silicone spatulas (cookie and large size) for the past 8-10 years now. Purchase, break, then purchase another one. The same fault exists here - I don't think there's a perfect way to integrate silicone and metal in the body of spatula without the metal eventually tearing the silicone. The same happened here with the DI ORO set but after reading stellar reviews about their customer service and warranty, I contacted the vendor and the reviews weren't lying. It was super easy to get a replacement shipped to us and I will never hesitate to purchase another product from DI ORO."
"Bought these to replace old nylon spatulas that had served their purpose over the years. Big improvement. These are flexible, heat resistant, and easy-to-clean. The length of the spatulas is a bit shorter than the ones they replace, which I prefer (easier to put in dishwasher, store in drawer, etc.). A labeling error resulted in my receiving the wrong set initially, and Customer Service did an excellent job of getting me the right set in time for the holidays. Very pleased with this set."
"Bought these specifically for use with some hard anodized cookware that I have. After comparing available options, these seemed to be the best value for money, and I have been happy with the other Di Oro products that I own. I would not hesitate to purchase another set of these, or to purchase other Di Oro products in the future. If you're looking for a good set of turners / spatulas that are great for non-stick surfaces and a step above the cheap silicone or nylon utensils, I would absolutely suggest giving these a try."
"This brand was suggested by America's Test Kitchen. I love them. I use them when I cook in cast iron and with non stick pans. I no longer keep (out) both the plastic (or whatever they are made of) and metal utensils. I could not convince my husband that eating off Teflon once it's been scratched is a death sentence (kinda). So, the metal ones are put away and these remain out. These don't melt when he leaves them propped up on the side of the cast iron and will not scratch the non stick coatings. Win, win!"
"I recently bought a very high quality non-stick frying pan and want to preserve its surface as long as possible. These are great spatulas. Some reviewers note (negatively) that the edges are pliant, but I find this an asset, as even wooden or plastic utensils will scratch a non-stick pan. The edges are not so pliant that they render the spatulas ineffective, IMO. Would definitely buy again."
I was pleasantly surprised when I received the set. They have a good weight to the feel and they are not cheaply made. The handle and blades are both silicone. The silicone blades surround the steel head. The edge of the blade are thin and slide well under food. I wanted a product that wouldn't allow food buildup at the head and handle connection. These are well tampered and are easy to clean with no area where food can accumulate. I haven't tested the heat resistance yet but the material is similar to other silicone products I use so I feel confident they perform well. I just wish the handle was another inch or two longer.
"We've all purchased cheap spatulas and know the ends melt easily with normal use. So why not spend a little more the first time and not have to replace your cooking tools after a few uses? These hold up well, they are thinner because of the higher quality materials and are easy to clean. I wish I had purchased better tools sooner, I would have honestly saved money if I had."
"Absolutely love these spatulas... I bought a three pack for me, and extras to give as gifts. They are thin and flexible for flipping pancakes, cookies, fish... everything! Highly recommended. After several months, one of mine got sliced somehow (near a knife in the dishwasher?)... I was bummed but reached out to see if I could get mine replaced. Sure enough, got a response the same day (on a holiday) and the replacement arrived a few days later. I will stick with Di Oro for my gadget needs!"
"I bought the set of three spatulas two years ago and couldn't have been happier! We love the product so much that this is our now go to brand. A few days ago the coating on one of the spatulas started to come off in the middle started to brake through. I contacted their customer service along with a photo of the damage product. They immediately replaced the item hassle free! I was blown away by the phenomenal customer service as you don't seem to get that anymore. It wasn't a fight, it wasn't a hassle, it was EASY like it should be. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS!!!"
"We had conventional plastic-like spatulas but I noticed the working ends starting to wear and even flake. There's enough micro-plastic floating around the environment without me adding it directly to my food.  After carefully reviewing the choices on Amazon, this set seems the very best. Key features to look for: silicone over steel for the blades, silicone handle. The selection of the three sizes is well specified. The handling and usability are great."
"I'm always skeptical when I buy products like this. They are not flimsy at all. Strong enough to break up ground meat and cut through soft foods, yet soft on my nonstick pans. LOVE these!"
"I bought this set of spatulas on October 6, 2020 and so far they've performed like a dream. Even though my original intent was to use them solely with my non-stick kitchenware, I started used them with everything. My favorite is the wide ""pancake"" spatula which is really multi-purpose. The smaller one is great for cookies, turning fish sticks, and that sort of thing. The other one is a standard size and it's the one I use the least - but only because the other two handle just about everything! They're very sturdy and clean up easily. After reading a couple of other reviews, apparently the handles sometimes push through the silicone, but there's been no sign of that. Besides, there's a lifetime guarantee, so how can you lose? Awesome purchase."
"Like the shapes and sturdiness of these items. Only drawback is in the dishwasher, spots are left on the silicone parts. I now hand wash these items."
Title says it all. Happy with them. Nice step up from the hard plastic stuff in my opinion. Should help preserve the life of my nonstick pans as well.
"I replaced my entire set of spatulas with Di Oro spatulas and haven't looked back. I'm so happy with the upgrade. My spatulas used to melt if I forgot them on the pan, but no longer - these bad boys have no problems with the heat. Best. *specialized* Spatulas. Ever."
"They have different sizes. I really like the bigger sizes, it's great for pancakes. This is the second order of cooking utensils I have bought from this company. They are lightweight with a quality look. They have a metal in between the handle and the spatula part, which makes it very sturdy."
"Yes, the small things matter, and it turns out these little flippers brought a smile to my wife's face because they work! My most recent venture into the kitchen resulted in two spatulas basically getting destroyed, as the edges crumbled in a hot pan. These spatulas hold up well under fire, with the right amount of ""bend but don't break"" backbone. Highly recommended."
"bought the spatulas a year ago when I was looking for a high heat resistant silicone spatula. all three spatulas do resist the high temperature of my stove. none of them has any part melt, like stated in the product introduction. after some time of use, one of them has a corner bent. I lately contacted its customer service, and they honored their lifelong warranty. after providing a photo of the product, they sent me a new one promptly. I was worried if it would takes longer as this is after one year of purchase, but the process turned out to be hassle-free and friendly. I have offline recommended this product to a couple of friends already."
"Purchased these spatulas and love the different design styles. Months after using and enjoying them, I noticed a imperfection on one of the spatulas edge. I contacted them and received a replacement as promissed by their warrantee. Rest assured that these are not only good spatulas, but stand by their warrantee. Buy with confidence."
"I was looking for something that was suitable to use in nonstick cookware. I had my reservations about anything other than metal spatulas because the non-metal ones are so easily melted, distorted, etc. These are the best spatulas I've ever owned, hands down. I highly recommend"
"We bought these to encourage care of some new non-stick pans by renters in our beach condo. We felt they were pretty pricey, but meanwhile the folks were either using metal spoons, or melting our cake spatulas (condo is well equipped!) cooking their eggs. These appear to be very high quality, up to the task. Will report back in 12 months."
"These are a great set of spatulas, especially if looking for something that will not scratch but will also provide rigidity. They are well designed and look very nice in the kitchen. DI ORO honors their lifetime warranty - I had a minor cut in the corner of one spatula after a year of use where the metal spatula had cut the surrounding silicone. After an email and a picture they shipped the replacement item - no charge. If you are looking for a quality product from an American based company that cares about reputation, then I recommend this product."
"I have All-Clad nonstick cookware. I've been through all of the cheap utensils that you get at the grocery store, or Target, etc. The ones that melt, or the edge melts. Always. These are great! They're sturdy and well made. They're oblivious to even high heat. They are ergonomic and feel professional."
"I've purchased another soft/silicone, well-known brand and had the metal part poke through and the product didn't last. I ordered these, fully expecting the same experience. I was right on one of the spatulas so far...the others are going strong with no hint of poke through. That said, I contacted the company, it was extremely easy and I had a new classic turner in less than a week. They immediately sent it out no questions asked. Top Notch! I've just ordered all of my new spoons and spatulas from them to replace the metal that I cannot use on my nonstick pans. Can't recommend them enough!"
"I have a favorite spatula by OXO that needed replacing, and bought these by mistake. When I realized they were a different brand , I expected to send them back. So glad I made the mistake! They are great shapes, with a better design connecting the silicone to the handle. These will probably outlast the other."
"I had bought an egg turner that was similar to this and loved it so much I looked for it everywhere and could not find one like it. This set is very sturdy while being flexible and strong. I love all three pieces. They are thin enough to get under food, but strong enough to pick up the heaviest pieces."
"I‚Äôve own most of DiOri‚Äôs kitchen products and they all perform as intended. I bought my mother in law this set for Christmas last year to add to her collection and the rubber on the small spatula split so I contacted them and I already received a new one as a replacement! What a wonderful customer service department and company that stands by their forever warranty. I would highly recommend buying all there products, they far exceed my expectations!"
"I purchased a set of these that were me go to for all of my cooking. After a year, two of the turners had cracks.  I messaged through email, and the company shipped me replacements for free.  I purchased another set for my mom prior to this, and I am glad I did. Great company, and the best turners I have ever owned."
I am actually very impressed (probably because my expectations later became rather low). It is very convenient to use. I am using them now almost every day for indoor grill. Actually the one for pancakes is very convenient for salmon. So far they are all what was advertised.
These are very well constructed. They are not just a soft silicone spatula set. Each one is a metal spatula covered in silicone which makes working with food much easier and safer on our non-stick cookware. The shorter handles fit in a utensil drawer very well. These are a great addition to our cooking utensils; especially the smallest one that fits well in smaller pans.
I cannot say enough wonderful things about these egg-turning spatulas. They are thee perfect trio to handle all my kitchen needs. I have been through many spatulas over the years despite my care and respect for all kitchen tools and appliances. I trust the Di Oro name and have since bought other spatula products. They really are the best choice. Don't second guess whether or not to buy this set. It's also perfect for lasagne and is a solution for anything that requires turning food in a frying pan or in the oven. Definitely worth the money- hands down.
"I absolutely love my new spatulas my family and I have been cooking with them and let me tell you they live up to the standards and more. Honestly we have even tried to burn them in the frying pan, and they didn‚Äôt even burn at all. This set is very beautiful, it does everything that it says it do! Everyone should purchase this set and I guarantee you won‚Äôt regret it."
"I needed something to replace the old spatulas (which were either a hard type of plastic or soft/flimsy). These looked pretty good so gave them a try. And I'm so surprised by how much I'm enjoying them. I'm actually using all 3 of them but the largest one is favorite. They are great for the non-stick pans, have the perfect rigidity, but have soft edges which are quite thin to easily slip under fried eggs or other rather tender foods. Anyway, I'm delighted with them and am sending a set to my daughter-in-law who loves to cook. I couldn't be happier!"
They stand behind their products forever. After two years they replaced a damaged spatula free of charge. All they asked for was the order number and a picture. So easy. Shipping out tomorrow at the latest. Can‚Äôt ask for more. Great product.
"This is fourth or fifth set I have purchased for personal use or as gifts.  I like the sturdy/stiffness of the pieces. Let's you flip items without bending!  They clean up very easily, putting them in the dishwasher. üòÅ  Definitely recommend."
"Bought these when I purchased a new cookware set from Caraway (which ROCKS btw.) I like the medium sized one the best. The other two pieces I rarely use. So far so good. No peeling, cracking, crumbling etc like I‚Äôve seen on other scratch proof utensils. I like the sturdiness, size, length and weight. Dishwasher safe too."
These are great spatulas. I flip pita at 450¬∞F in a cast iron skillet. Very easy to flip the pita. I lay the handle on the side of the skillet with no issues. I had to return another set by another company because the handle melted when I laid them on the side of the skillet. I also use them when frying eggs and making omelets without any problems. I wash them by hand because they are so easy to clean and also to have them ready for the next job. I happily threw away my plastic spatulas after I started using this DI ORO set.
I use at least one of the the DI ORO Designer Series Elite 3-Piece Turner Spatulas daily and really like them. They hold up very well. I will continue to buy products from a company that will honored their lifetime warranty!
Great quality. Easy handle grip. Perfect to use on my Emeril cookware.
"Flipping things never looked so good!! Whether on the stove or outside at the grill these silicone spatulas do thier job well. They are heat resistant, durable, clean easily, and are a joy to flip various patties and pancakes with... nuff sed."
"I bought these for my 8 year old who is learning on how to make pancakes. He really enjoys using them until the the edges cracked after 3 months. Wish it would have lasted longer. Hopefully, the manufacturer will come up with solution to resolve this problem."
These work as designed - for use with non-stick pans. They have a metal core with a seamless silicone over-wrap. By nature the longer spatula has more flex than the shortest and the flex seems appropriate. They are a bit thicker than a metal or plastic-only spatula due to the construction but have worked fine for eggs and similar foods. They do have a tapered edge to help ease under food. Don't know how they would work with something very thin like a crepe. One caution - they are not built nor designed to scrape the crust from cast iron or similar pans. Used as designed and with common sense they work fine.
I don't know why it took me so long to order these spatula's. I've been using cheap ones for years and had to deal with the melting of the tips due to high heat. This will not happen with these. I've used the large one several times already and it is great for flipping because of the ability to flex just enough to conform with the side of the skillet . I will not hesitate to order more products from Di Oro. I cannot say enough about the lady who works there. I wish all customer service representatives were as good as this one.
These spatulas don't bend lifting large scoops of whatever you are transferring or serving to a separate dish. They are a perfect size and easy to manage inside any given pan. I didn't want to pay the cost but they have a lifetime warranty. With careful use they should last a while.
It looks like we are going to be extremely happy with the spatulas. I splurged on these because I am so tried removing sinters from Stanford Spatulas as they melt with use over time. My Husband Absolutely Loves Them!
"I never knew how horrible my spatulas were until I started using a set of Di Oro spatulas. I have used for many many different food items an I am impressed every time. They are also so easy to clean an heat tolerant that it makes my life much easier. I believe these spatulas will last me a lifetime, as long as someone doesn‚Äôt try to steal them from me. Keep up the great work Di Oro."
"I think only time will tell whether these spatulas are as sturdy as we hope. Our last OXO silicone spatula tore away at the point where the metal neck meets the spatula, and we are hoping this set will be better. So far, I can say that I like the range of sizes in this set, that they are heat-resistant, and we have high hopes for them."
"These are the best spatulas I‚Äôve purchased them for both my son‚Äôs families. Hate to give them too good of a rating, because they‚Äôre often out of stock when you go to get them. If everyone knows about them it‚Äôll just get worse."
"The short and wide turner is GREAT! The others are as well, but that stubby one is a turner I didn't even know I needed in my life!"
These are the best spatulas I've ever owned. I am so glad I stumbled across them browsing amazon! They're super flat compared to any other I've used. They come in 3 sizes which are good for just about everythin
"I am so elated over these spatulas! No hot handles, no food sticking to them and a fit for the job. My omelets are easily supported flipped intact. I am happy. I wrote the company and told them so. I hope if I'm still around in 20 years I'll still have them!"
"These things are made from magic. They are sturdy as hell, even if u push down on the tip where the metal meets plastic, it's 100% solid. Cleans with a wipe. 10/10, and I'm usually pretty critical."
Got these and threw away all of the other spatulas we had as these are just really well made. We use them on an extremely hot cast iron skillet to cook everything and they wash easily and are like new!
Simply perfect for no stick cookery. The silicone structure will not harm your pots and pans. The sharp edge gets right under the food and makes things easy to flip. Nothing better on the market.
"I was amazed at how sturdy these silicone spatulas were, not at all flimsy.I especially like the wide spatula. I am thrilled with my purchase and would highly recommend."
"These are perfect. They have a metal on the inside so the silicone can take the weight of the food. They are super easy to clean and look so nice! I love them, will buy more and recommend to friends."
"Just what I wanted: flexible blade but stiff enough to be effective, unlike silicon. Actually useful. Highly recommend. Finally found a replacement for my discarded old Pyrex spatulas. Works great with peanut butter or other thicker batters, etc. NOTE: SPATULA IS NOT HEAT RESISTANT. I wouldn't use it for above about 225F. Definitely not for a hot fry pan.  I like that the handle and blade are one piece. Much more resistent to bacterial growth (trapped in the fine gaps of a two piece spatula with removable handle) and easier to clean.  I believe the reviews about these arriving dirty. However, mine were individually sealed in plastic and arrived clean.  As many others have commented; STICKER REMOVAL can be a pain. Learned to use heat (a hair dryer): On medium to high, heat the area of the sticker for about 30 seconds, try peeling off sticker/label with finger nail. If no go, heat it some more (careful not to melt anything) and try again. When the sticker gets hot enough it should peel off easily. There will be residual adhesive stuck to the handle. It is not water soluble. Soak a paper towel with some mineral spirits or paint thinner and rub it off. Comes off easily. Then wash spatula in hot soapy water. Ready to go.  The sticker is a barrier to any solvent, so heating and removal of most of the sticker first speeds removal considerably. Although, using a solvent with no heat should work too - just takes a while for the solvent to soak into the label and it it more of a mess.  I've seen nail polish remover recommended for removing both the sicker/label and the residual adhesive. Although this should work, I would be careful and test it on the end of the handle first. The solvent in nail polish remover is acetone and can dissolve some plastics."
"I got really tired of having to remover the blade from the handles of my spatulas/scrappers to remove the crud that builds up in them. I do not remember this happening with the spatulas of years gone by. But it seems to be an issue with spatulas of today -- the cheap ones, the expensive ones, the ones with wooden handles and the ones with handles of metal and plastic. Not sure why this happens, but it is maddening. So this single piece spatula does away with that problem. No seams or joins to trap butter, batter or frosting. Pop it in the dishwasher, and you're good to go again. And the handle design, which slightly elevates the blade from the counter top, is an unexpected plus. No setting the spatula down for ""just a second"", only to find when you pick it back up it has picked up errant sprinkles from the counter -- or that it has deposited a smear of frosting on your formica, tile or granite. But, oh that sticker! I ignored other reviewers who complained about the sticker. How hard could it be to get a sticker off? I thought they just weren't trying. In truth the sticker is fairly easy to get off. But the glue that affixed it? Forget it. It will not budge for soap, Goo-Gone, steel wool....you name it. Rubbermaid must have bought this stuff at a NASA surplus sale. That little strip of glue residue remains, an irritating reminder of Rubbermaid's inconsiderateness. So I took it down a star for that -- and am sorely tempted to take it down four stars. But in truth this is a serviceable spatula; easy to clean, with a semi-flexible blade and a study handle. The off-white color is a little grim, but a quick trip through the dishwasher and it's returned to its original industrial look -- it doesn't get greyer of dingier over time A lot of potential purchasers have asked if this is made of rubber or silicone. The answer is no --- if what you mean by ""rubber"" is natural rubber from a rubber tree. Nor is it silicone, which is heat resistant and known for its hypoallergenic nature. The blade is made from Thermoplastic Rubber, TPR, a synthetic material which has both the characteristics of rubber and plastic. TPR is a relatively new class of polymer. It has the solubility and thermoplasticity of polystyrene, while at ambient temperatures it has the toughness and resilience of vulcanized natural rubber or polybutadiene. It is not stiff, but is moderately flexible. You will not be able to snap it in half with your hand, which has been my experience with ""stiff plastic junk"". But like stiff plastic junk, and unlike silicone, you can't use it for hot temperature cooking, like melting sugar or making gravy. When exposed to heat, it will start to deform/melt. The handle, according to Rubbermaid, is made of polypropylene plastic. Polypropylene is a low cost, chemical resistant plastic which is why I assume Rubbermaid uses it for the handle. However the join of handle to blade appears seamless; you will not notice it. I wish Rubbermaid made this in colors -- it would seem easy enough to add color to the plastic handle. But Rubbermaid has to do something about the glue. The glue cheapens a product which, while inexpensive, is a good buy."
"I bought this, hoping it was like the old rubber ones that are flexible. I read the reviews, usually saying it was not but still, had some value. I was glad I bought it & bought 2 more to either keep one & give away the other, as I find it tremendously useful. Not always scraping but in just stirring.  This spatula is one of the best stirring tools I have! I make up my avocado dressing and it stirs the mix very well and thoroughly, the size being very helpful. I found when I added the dressing to the big bowl of salad, I used the spatula to mix it all together & boy, was I pleased! If using just a fork, as usual, it is harder & takes longer to mix all ingredients together. With this spatula, it's a breeze, so much faster and easier. I've used it elsewhere for stirring but the one that really stands out is the salad dressing & then the salad.  It does scrape the bowls too, not as well as I get from my smaller rubber spatula of old (üò•sniff!) but does well enough. Blending/stirring, that is this spatula's strong suit. I was surprised by this secret ability & recommend this for sure!"
"I would have to say this particular spatula came just in the nick of time and created a pinnacle point in my life.  I mean how else would any sane individual make Christmas cookies for the masses without a spatula. Yes yes I know you could always grab a spoon for the assist but it‚Äôs just not the same.  I needed the right tool for the right job and the spatula was it. I also needed a hand mixer, but that my friends is a story to be had with drinks and interpretive dance.  So all in all this spatula was amazing and you too should get one. Why because you know awesome and definitely need to have one."
"I bought this spatula a few months ago, and loved it. The only problem as others have said is removing the darn 5"" label on the handle! I used lighter fluid, label remover, and finally picking away at it with my fingernails. It wasn't easy.  I left it at a friends house and decided to buy a couple more last week. Spending a little more time to analyze the problem, I quickly realized that there is a 3/8"" hollow portion of the handle that goes down the full length of the label. So with the tip of a sharp paring knife, I simply cut down the middle of the label, then simply peeled back both sides from the middle. It came off in a matter of seconds without leaving any gummy residue.  Of course if Rubbermaid would simply use a less secure adhesive on their label, all of this frustration could be eliminated. But as far as the spatula itself, it works perfectly for scrambled eggs, omelets, and anything else I've thrown at it. Rigid, but not too rigid. And you can't beat the price!"
"It works just as expected. Sturdy and for $2, you can't beat that. Do not listen to the wieners that claims it was difficult to remove the label and it's made in China. Common sense is your greatest friend. Just carefully remove the label by simply pulling it without tearing the label will do wonder. That simple really. Oh, it's made in China...and so about 95% of your stuff. Why do you think it's $2? Hello common senseüòò"
"I bake and cook a lot, and I am very picky about my spatulas. They can't be too stiff, where it's hard to use them to scrape bowls well, and they can't be too flimsy either. It is very difficult to find the perfect one. Recently I was shopping for a new spatula after my old favorite had started breaking down around the edges from age and too many trips through the dishwasher. None of the stores in my area had anything that would work for me. After reading reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this Rubbermaid Commercial one. It's perfect! It seems very well made and sturdy. I like that it is seamless between the handle and head so that water can't get up inside. I plan to purchase a couple more soon."
I was hesitant to purchase this spatula due to some reviews stating that the sticker was unusually hard to remove. But I purchased it anyway since I desperately needed to replace my identical old one that finally turned brittle.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the sticker peeled off just fine. It came off nicely & cleanly. I speculate that perhaps the consumers that had a hard time received a batch that possibly sat in the sun or some hot warehouse that caused the sticker to be hard to peel off. I am happy to report that I did not have that issue at all.
"This was just what I wanted. I did not experience any of the problems that I saw listed in other reviews. The spatula was not filthy dirty when delivered, it arrived in its own plastic pouch. The large sticker on the handle could have been a problem but forewarned I simply soaked it in alcohol and was able to peel it off with virtually no residue. The counter rest was a nice touch.  I plan on using it just for scraping out the last bits of batter from a glass mixing bowl and it seems just right for that.  JIM"
"This is a false statement in the product description: Recognized as a ‚ÄúBrand of the Century‚Äù, Rubbermaid is one of only 100 companies named as having an impact on the American way of life. RCP products are made in Winchester, Virginia. Each of my spatulas has a Made in China sticker on it."
"We use in these in the restaurant I work in, and liked them so much I had to purchase some for home use. I had always purchased the cheap ones you find in department stores, but was never happy with how they worked, or lasted! They were either to soft, or to hard to scrape the bowl or pan well enough, and I was constantly replacing them because they would never last.  I do a lot of baking and cooking, and these are a dream come true. Not only do they have just the right amount give to them to scrape mixing bowls clean, but they're sturdy enough for stirring and folding in ingredients. They don't discolor, not that it would matter to me, are super easy to clean, and they're microwave and dishwasher safe. The handle and scrapper are one piece, so you don't have to worry about food getting caught between them causing bacterial growth, which can cause food born illnesses. I got food poisoning once as a kid from improperly handled food (we didn't know as much about such things then as we do now), and never want to go through that again.  These may be a bit more expensive that the ""bargain"" ones you'll find in the stores, but in terms of usability and longevity, you'll actually save yourself time, money, and frustration. Now that I found where to get these, I'll never buy anything else."
"My old wood-handled Rubbermaid spatula wore out and needed replacing. I was so glad to find this one on Amazon! Although it has a plastic handle instead of the wood I would have preferred, it is not stiff the way so many of the silicone models I've seen lately are. It will more readily follow the contours of my mixing bowls and provide a clean scrape. Wish the handle were a little longer, but the blade is the size and shape I was looking for."
"Don't understand the negative reviews. In my opinion, these are the golden standard in rubber scrapers. Dishwasher safe, extremely flexible - and with one square and one curved edge. I find myself using these every day. I have used 13 million rubber scrapers in my life, most of them miserable, and I can tell you that this is the one you want. No other scraper I have ever used can scrape a bowl clean so easily with so little effort - again, mostly because the rubber is very flexible. You would think that with the rubber being so flexible that over time, it would degrade and fall apart, but my mother has some of these that are probably 20+ years old that have been used and put through the dishwasher thousands of times that look identical to the extras I just picked up on amazon. The only thing different between these new ones and the old ones is that the new ones have an extra little protrusion on one side so you can rest it on the counter without getting whatever is on it on the counter - I actually happen to like this small improvement.  One suggestion - I would also pick up a couple of the 13.5"" size. I find myself using those more frequently."
This spatula is exactly what I wanted. It is a good length for home use and I really like the one piece handle and blade. I think it is unfair for people complaining it is not heat resistant- it never claims to be and common sense says don't use it in a hot pan for fear of melting. The sticker comes off easily with my fingernail and rubbing alcohol on a rag takes off any sticky residue and any scuff marks. Great spatula at a great price. 5 stars
This is one cool tool. I use it for everything from icing cakes to smoothing out mashed potatoes on shepherd's pie. It hasn't let me down yet. The scraper edge is superb for scraping icing or cake batter and it is super easy to clean. I just basically have to run water over it and the stuff glides out. It also helps me clean the other bowls and pans by contouring to the edges so well that it doesn't leave much batter etc. stuck to them. Get it!
"I have been trying to find a real rubber spatula for a long time. I like the way they hug the curved surfaces of bowls when I am scraping them. I hesitated to buy silicone because I believed that they are stiffer and therefore are not as flexible. I finally gave in and bought this one because it is advertised as a rubber spatula. I don't believe that it is the same type of rubber that I am used to. However, I do find it to be flexible enough for my needs."
"These are super sturdy and great for scraping mixing bowls! A lot of people complained about the sticker removal and dirt on them. Not an issue! I soaked them in hot soapy bleach (just a small amout) water for about an hour. Then used the non-serrated side of a butter knife to scape the stickers off. To remove the tiny bits of sticker, I sprayed them with cooking oil and with my thumb nail the sticker residue was gone...and so was the ""dirt""! Great product for less money!"
"They won't last forever but, they are a good value for money. The have a ""Just Right"" flexibility for our typical cooking and baking needs. We bought four this time and expect they will last a few years. Other brands we have tried are to hard or bend in all the wrong places."
This little spatula is so handy. It's just the right size for mixing batters and scraping the bowl. I have several Rubbermaid spatulas and they all came with a barcode sticker. I use my fingernails and olive oil to scrape off the paper and sticky residue. It only takes a couple of minutes and it removes all of it.
Almost didn't purchase it due to people complaining about not being able to remove the sticker that was on it. Glad I did anyway. First lifted the edges with a little window scrapper knife & it all pealed right off with no residue.  Nice classic inexpensive white spatula. Good size for general use. Probably not at all heat resistant. Not needed nor tested for that. Happy.
I'm ashamed to admit that I've wasted a lot of batter trying to scrape the bowl with a spoon. I felt like a buffoon but this tool is a total batter saver. No instructions are included but you can find tutorials on YouTube
"I have been LOOKING for this size spatula for a couple of years for my wife and when I found them I bought 3 for her! She was VERY, VERY HAPPY! Now to find the Frosting spatula spreading size for here!!!"
"Saw the review for this in Cooks Illustrated and couldn't believe there was a spatula out there that was real rubber and I had missed it, but here it is! Just like the old Rubbermaids of yore. It is all it says that it is! It has a substantial handle a very good sized ""head"" and a little notch to clean the bowl. There are two handle lengths, a 13 inch and a 9 1/2'. At first I thought the 13"" was too long, however, it has become very useful for many jobs around the kitchen."
"Heat the sticker with a blow dryer or heat gun. Comes off completely, with all the adhesive. Easy Peasy! Heat in 15 second intervals trying to peel off each interval til it‚Äôs warm enough to come right off easily and cleanly. No fighting with razor blades, solvents, and so on. Should take about two minutes. Oh yeah, it‚Äôs a good scraper/spreader too."
"This is exactly what I was looking for. Not too stiff and not too flexible and feels great in your hand (balance and handle length is perfect). Rubbermaid is also a brand I trust to maintain product integrity over time.  I've purchased far more expensive spatulas and not been as satisfied. I purchased two from Pampered Chef and they are completely inferior. The business end actually has developed something that I noticed when I recently made some cake batter and licked the spatula after scraping the bowl. The spatula had a very strong chemical taste! I tested the batter in the pan with a spoon and there was no chemical taste, so it was definitely in the spatula. I don't want to risk that taste transferring to anything I make using it, so the Pampered chef spatulas are in the trash!"
"These are the best. National Sanitation Foundation approved, which means there are no points where food / bacteria can accumulate. Even the joint between the handle and paddle is completely sealed. The rigid handle stands up to even stiff material without bending or breaking. Just enough flexibility in paddle edge to conform to bowl, for thorough scraping.  Note: This scraper is not designed for high temperatures, like hot skillets. For that, select Rubbermaid's Commercial Silicone spatula (look for red handle)."
"It was my mistake...I guess I forgot there's a difference between rubber and silicone. Also, it's advertized as 9.5"" long. It was a tad shorter....9 1/4. Not huge difference but it had a different ""feel"" in my hand. If those two things don't matter to you there won't be an issue. I will keep it anyway. At that price it's worth it"
"Been looking for a replacement for my Rubbermaid spatula. Most are too stiff....more of a hard plastic. This has a hard plastic handle, that seems to morph into a rubber end. That is, it appears to be all in one piece, but the blade is rubber and the handle hard plastic. It is more stiff than my old one, but still flexible, and shouldn't brrrreak off the handle as my old one did."
I purchase a Rubbermaid spatulas they seem very sturdy and hard. They're not the type that will slip off it's all connected. Ask for heat an easy to clean I haven't used them to answer that question but I gave it at 3 stores because I'm pretty sure they're going to work well.
"Husband was confused when this arrived.  I didn't want to stick my fingers in my expensive face cream for ya know, germs. Got this to do that fancy spooning out of product onto hand... Haven't used it because cream is too expensive and now don't want to put any on face. Spatula is great though. $2, sturdy, just fantastic."
"I have had many scrapers over the years but none have performed as well as Rubbermaid. I still have one Rubbermaid scraper with a wooden handle that must be 25 years old and is still working great! My one complaint is not about the scraper, but I did not like that they put a sticker on the handle part and I had a heck of a time getting the sticker and residue off the handle. Why can't manufacturers make stickers that come off easily? In spite of that I still gave it 5 stars because the Rubbermaid scraper is the most pliable scraper I've ever found and the easiest to work with."
"I grew up with Rubbermaid and had this exact spatula in my ""toolkit"" when I was a professional cook. It was age that made me toss it. The silicone spatulas are great, but they are too small for me and uni-taskers.  great product, great price"
"Rubbermaid definitely is the brand I go to for my kitchen products and this didn't fail me either. The spatula is great. Good grip, great quality rubber for mixing, no rubber smell like you might find on some other rubber spatulas. Washes easily and doesn't stain either."
"I like the size, fits into jars as well as doing a good job scraping a bowl. The deep groves on the handle make gripping easy but a little harder to clean."
"Like the old fashioned ones, but sturdier. I don't like the new silicone ones because they don't scale the bowl clean- more for mixing. These work great for scraping batter from bowls."
"This spatula‚Äôs handle & spreader are a single integral unit, unlike many others which are two-pieced. Those collect gunk where the handle inserts into the spreader, ecchhh. The spreader is flexible yet strong, making it easy toscrape out bowls, etc."
"I removed a star because the handle is not completely solid. I find it a bit of an inconvenience to scrub inside this dipped part each time... on both sides of the spatula. Otherwise, I love it for use in my small food processor."
This is the original rubber spatula. It is a great product. Simple and easy to use and clean. Rubber spatula with a plastic handle.
this are the best both for home or commercially. much more flexible than most yet durable.
This scraper is a bit stiffer than my old one but works well. Others posted about how the sticker on the handle was impossible to remove. Mine came off easily with judicious application of Goo Gone.
"The main problem was getting the very sticky label off. Even after it was off the sticky glue was there, and took several washings to remove."
"It's strong, sturdy, durable, and the head is made of rubber. It actually conforms to your bowl thus scraping out every last bit of goodness. Which is why, in the olde days, they called these scrapers: Child-cheaters!  Unless you're working in a professional kitchen, or making double & triple batches of whatever, get the 9 1/2"" scraper. It's the standard size for home kitchens.  The price is right, you can get it with Super Saver Shipping, and no cheap silicon scraper can beat this Rubbermaid for the performance we've all been searching for since our old-fashioned childcheaters bit the dust. Thanks, Rubbermaid, for making these available again!  Buy with confidence, you won't be disappointed."
I love this spatula! Just like the ones I had years ago.
"Just wanted to let others know that my spatula arrived with no obnoxious sticker as was described in earlier reviews. Was not looking forward to the fight of removing that thing, but the sticker that was attached to my spatula was very easily removed by me. Somebody's paying attention to what customers have said. How refreshing!"
"I use a rubber spatula for everything for frying eggs, mixing salads and mixing cookie dough."
This type of spatula has been in existence for as long as I can remember. I'm glad I found one on Amazon. They are very useful and the one I bought is just as expected.
It's a spatula. Enough said...
"I feel I must deviate somewhat from the crowd here on these Rubbermaid Scraper/Spatulas (FG1901000000). They are indeed more pliable than the gaggle of brightly colored rigid $5 ~ $15 each scraper/spatulas that the local chains insist on carrying (to the exclusion of anything like these white ones at $1.88 each). However they are not as pliable as the older Rubbermaid and Pyrex wood handled ones that have over the years now gone brittle on us. The curvature at the business end of these is also different and does not fit quite as well into the curvature of typical Sunbeam and Kitchenaid mixer bowls. I would rank these about halfway between those we grew to love and those bright colored disfunctional ones now sold in our local stores.  I would be remiss if I didn't register one direct complaint about these. The three I ordered all came with adhesive bar code labels affixed on the handles. When I say adhesive, I mean ""adhesive"". They would not peel off. We had to soak them in hot water, and still then had to scrape them off with our fingernails. Then Goo Gone was necessary to use to remove the remaining label fragments and adhesive. $1.88 each, plus labor. I hate those kind of labels.  UPDATE 12/23/2014): Farberware is what you should be looking for. Plastic handles, but the business end is shaped like those we knew and loved and the material is perfect. Pliable like those of old for scraping, shaped right, and tolerant to cooking temperatures. They are a bit pricier and I found Farberware in different combinations here on Amazon recently, but my wife found a set of (3) Farberware spatulas at a chain named Big Lots for only $4.00. Here is a link to that sku ""http://www.biglots.com/p/farberware-silicone-spatulas-3-piece-set"". Appears from the web site that they are only available in-store at Big Lots. Hope this helps!"
Use it with my other Rubbermaid spatula. I've not tested it out for its heat resistance so I cannot comment. I work dealing with scraping out cookie or cake batter from bowls.
"It's the perfect tool for the kitchen. Don't place it on hot burner, they melt."
Very practical and easy to clean
"The seamless construction makes these easy to clean, and the sturdy rubber is great for scraping out my mixing bowls. I've bought several for myself and for my mother. Too many of the ones you see in stores have seams, or are made with too-flexible silicone. Silicone has its place, but it's just not as sturdy as rubber, which is what I want when dealing with thick cookie dough or heavy batter."
we use for cold products bought heat resistant ones for cooking this is a nice sturdy kitchen tool defenitely recommend
"I am a changed man since this spatula was delivered to our doorstep.  I feel more fulfilled, more green, more ... useful!  Now, I can get the last of the mayonnaise out of the jar. I can get every last drop of pancake batter out of the bowl and onto the griddle. From scraping food out of things to spreading food on things, I'm sure that I am just at the start of this amazing journey. Who knew?"
I remember my mom having this exact spatula. It's so inexpensive but works great and lasts. I use it all the time when I am baking.
THIS IS A REALLY STURDY SPATULA. IT DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB SCRAPING A BOWEL AND IS EASY TO CLEAN.
I like everything about it. Very satisfied
"After carefully doing my shopping homework, I selected these scrapers thinking that they were the best quality out there. I believe I was right! My wife does plenty of cooking with these and really likes the size and quality of the rubber scraper itself. The head is molded onto the handle so it will not likely ever come off until the thing is absolutely worn out. Very glad I found these on Amazon and the price, including shipping, is very fair I think."
"This is the Spatula all others are measured by. Perfect, for a great price."
I used this to stir chocolate that I was melting on the stove top and it stained!! So disappointed üòû! At least it was cheap
"I liked the first one so much that I got another. You will see, get one, or twoüòâ"
It‚Äôs easy to clean and stir cake pan batter. Very sturdy.
"This is a medium-sized rubber spatula, which I bought for scooping out jars and cans. It accomplishes this task perfectly well. It is not billed as a silicone product, therefore I do not expose it to heat. The size of the handle is just right to allow me to maneuver inside jars and cans. It is not a thin spatula, so pay close attention to the measurements before you buy this one as it will not fit smaller-mouthed jars. Very happy with my purchase!"
"This IS the original Rubbermaid ""RUBBER"" spatula that we all grew up with. It's not that annoying inflexible Silicone blades that every other spatula uses now.  These are great and cheap. They do stain easily and they don't handle high temps as well as the Silicone ones do, but at this price you can just buy extras and throw them out when they get stained too bad.  I really love these spatulas."
It's A Spatula. It does everything I require A spatula to do.
"Whenever I go into a lunatic rage in the kitchen like a drunken Gordon Ramsay with Tourette's, I make sure to swing one of these babies around so people know I'm serious, and not a wannabe crybaby with a broken Easy-Bake oven.  The Rubbermaid Commercial FG1901000000 Scraper, 9.5-inch, White will leave your loved ones knowing who is in charge of the badass kitchen."
"This is a good strong easy to clean spatula, with no cracks that are hard to clean."
The right size for most cooking projects. Very helpful.
All 1 piece The ones with the removeable spatula tops can collect mold. This is 1 solid piece.
I am happy with my Rubbermaid scraper and find it very useful in all temperatures.
"I hunted high and low for this type of spatula because they are a great design. They get into a small area and are easy to clean. One of the best features is that the head does not come off, especially in the bottom of a jar. A wonderful price for a great product. I have recommended this product to several friends because of the quality and price."
"I bought these for myself in the small and large sized. I adore them. The week before I ordered these, I broke at least 6 regular 2 piece spatulas. They would just snap at the handle. Plus the end would keep coming off and they were harder to clean. I saw these and thought ...problem solved. The silicone, one piece are the answer and they are more flexible so they don't snap in half. They would make an excellent stocking stuffer for the cook in the family. I will never buy anything else."
"I got a free version of these spatulas from a major retailer a year or so ago and have been looking for something comparable. This is it. I wanted to give my kids each one, and get one in our cabin too. I find this so useful, for scraping out the peanut putter jar, making sure all the sour cream is used up, scraping frosting or batter, getting the last of the sauce out of the skillet, etc. I use this more than any other soft spatula I own. Strong yet flexible. I honestly haven‚Äôt tested the heat resistance, but it has not melted with regular use. These are identical to the one I got for free and I am sooooo happy. Never thought I would rave about a spatula. Perfect size."
"These smaller spatulas have become my ""go to"" utensils. Great for all kinds of jobs when a large spatula is just too much. I grind my own nut flours and they work perfectly for removing the flours from the burr grinder. Also the right size for cleaning out condiment jars, etc. I use them when I cook scrambled eggs. They fit better in the butter tub than a large spatula. Tuna salad for one? Perfect tool! I had one, now I have six; they are that handy!"
"These are a nice smaller size spatula, which they work well and are very easy to clean. The colors are also really cute. They are as advertised and the shipping was very quick. I would definitely order these again if I was ever in the need for more spatulas."
"I had a couple old ones I wanted to throw away, but didn't have replacements. Just one of those things you'll get around to doing, then don't. I found these, and got rid of the others. Wow, these are handy for just about anything. Since I got them, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't use them. I have a set of 5, so I always have spares. Easy to clean in the dishwasher or by hand, and they are sturdy. I have left them on the edge of a pot for several minutes (forgetful), but no melting or staining, and it wasn't hot to touch."
Those are great. They are exactly what I needed. I am going to buy some for my sister too. They are sturdy when I need to flip crepes. They are flexible and sturdy whenever needed depending how you manipulate them. They are perfect when I need to fold some cream or batter and scrap the bowl walls. These are not good for frying certain things like pan fried potatoes that attach to the bottom of the pan. You need harder spatulas and bent shaped to scrap and fold harder things. I definitely recommend them.
"Yes, these are small. They are soup spoon sized. I have full sized spatulas for mixing a big bowl of stuff but I reach for the small ones more often. No seams mean it's easy to clean and the metal core gives it all the strength I could want. I bought this set to replace the single black one that I used so much that it was finally starting to crack around the neck. Now I have five colorful ones and I love them."
"I had one of these and found myself using it several times a day, washing it and re-using it. Decided to get another one and found this assortment of colors. I just keep them in my utensil drainer in my sink because I use them so often, starting with stirring my oatmeal in the morning, scraping pans before washing, guiding food scraps down the garbage disposal, etc."
"I love these spatulas! Perfect size for scraping jars and mixing bowls. The handle is long enough to use in many applications. I have used them in my crock pots and baking dishes and they have not had any problems with the heat. Hold up well in the dishwasher and are easy to hand wash also. They are a 1 piece construction so no places for food, water, or bacteria to collect."
"This is the perfect size for scraping everything out of my Billiance Rubbermade containers, my 3 cup food processor, small jars, and stirring things up in my 8"" fry pan. I love them for spreading cheese sauces, mayo and so much more onto casseroles, sandwiches and the like. It's the same shape as the plastic spatula that came with my processor only better and I love that I have a handful! Great buy. Highly recommend."
I purchased these because I didn't like the ease of use of the more expensive ones that I purchased early in 2018. I use these all the time because they clean out the bowl and jar much better. I would recommend them. They may not last but what is use in having a heavy duty spatula in the drawer and avoiding it.
I'm one of those people who like to kill a jar of peanut butter in full. I keep searching for the perfect spatula to do the job because I buy 40 oz jars. These are awesome. I do not have to choose between wasting peanut butter and going through a really hard time to get the last little bit out. The one piece design means I don't have to take it apart to get the peanut butter that gets inside out. The stainless steel interior gives it the perfect strength throughout. cleans it out top to very bottom.
"This is the second time I have purchased these. I have so many uses for them, and being lazy, appreciate that I can use and toss in the dishwasher. They get into small spaces, are just the right amount of flexible. One of my favorite uses is to get the last little bit of egg out of my bowl, when scrambling eggs."
"I bought a set of different sized silicon spatulas, but the one that was this size was the one I kept using. So, I searched for a set that was only this size, and this set is perfect. I use them *a lot* and they're great! They work really well for scraping out the last of something from a jar or a can, and they're great for stirring small batches of things. I like them a lot, and the colors are so pretty!"
I was anxious to see how well I did using these spatulas considering the choice of sizes I was given. I have a small hand so with the smaller size I did very well. I like the fact that I can use these spatulas can be used to stir hot food while I am using the stove. Love that they go in the dishwasher. I bought two packages by mistake but I decided to keep the extra and put them in stocking this Christmas. I would buy these again.
"So yeah, these are 5 rubber spatulas. I've used them to cook eggs, and some other things in hot pans. I use them to scrape stuff out of tin cans. They are quite small, surprisingly smaller than I anticipated, but still quite functional. I've washed them in my dishwasher without any problems. They are actually perfect for scraping soup out of soup cans. I like them. If you need some small rubber spatulas, order these. Good value."
"I‚Äôm OBSESSED with these and have turned so many people on to these... they are constantly in use in my kitchen whether stirring in nonstick pans or scraping a bowl or inside of a jar... these little guys pack a game changing punch... cleaning is a breeze since they are a single piece... no food or water gets caught in between the handle and the spatula part to mold/mildew later! Now, can‚Äôt live without them!"
"I use these little guys every day. I have a lot of non-stick cookware and bakeware, so I need utensils that won't scratch the coatings. When I'm heating up something on the stove, I run them around the sides of the pot to keep everything incorporated and to scrape the bottom of the pot in case something tries to stick. When baking, I use them to scrape down the sides of bowls and make sure I get every last drop into the baking pan. They are very good scrapers - just flexible enough to get everything off all the curved surfaces. There are always a couple of them in my dishwasher!"
"We have only had these for a month or two and don't use them daily or in high-heat situations, but we are very happy with them compared to the two-part spatulas we've had previously (plastic handle and separate silicone head). They have a good amount of flex in the head (not too little, not too much) and clean very easily due to being a single piece with no awkward corners."
"I was disappointed when we got them because I guess I thought they'd be bigger. They ended up working out great and we use several per day. One of them had the tip break off a little, but I suspect my teenage daughter was mis-using it. We've had them a couple months and that is the only complaint.  Primarily used for rice, quinoa and scrambled eggs. Single servings."
These are much better made than those found in most local stores. These are a little thicker in the middle and around the edges that make them much better than the cheap ones. I use these a lot and will be ordering more in the future.
"These little spatulas are very sturdy, easy to clean and one solid piece! I make lotions, soaps and other items, so I wanted one solid piece, easier to clean and easier to sanitize, that was my most important need. You can find small spatula‚Äôs all day long, but almost all are made with 2 pieces, a germ haven! My only wish now is if they could make a smaller version."
These little things are sooo useful! I have two out at all times and literally use them multiple times a day. Have one to my sister and she dies the same. I‚Äôll put one in my camper and I use one for making body products! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
"These spatulas peform exactly like they say they will! Food does not stick to them, they are heat resistant and hold up to the strongest mixture of food they are mixing! Will definitely recommend them to my friends!"
I‚Äôve been an Amazon prime member for 10 years and have spent thousands here. I can safely say this is one of the top 5 things I‚Äôve ever bought. I bought a second pack and I still go through them all. Use them for everything
"I love these! They are great for scraping stuff out of cans, small food processors or even frying an egg. I‚Äôm giving them as stocking stuffers. I have4 myself. They are a tiny work horse in the kitchen. Get some!"
"Purchased to use for soap making but didn't really need five... so two ended up in the kitchen where they have come in very handy in scraping smaller containers and for cooking. In my soap making, these are the perfect size for the containers I use to scrape out the measuring cups I use to color portions of the soap batter."
"literally / actually / really the very best most versatile spatulas ive ever had, and ive had too many already, didn't even need these but am always on the hunt for the perfect spatulas... im not saying im done looking, but im not frantically searching anymore. i think im in love üòç"
"I like that it easy to clean, 1 piece, lovely colors, length is good. I use the spatulas for stirring and scooping. Especially helpful when I am baking because with 5 spatulas, I can designate 1 spatula per bowl. Also, no more scraping Teflon from pots and pans. Good price and quick delivery."
I make my own yogurt in pint canning jars in my Instapot pressure cooker. One should never use metal items in the jars and now I have the perfect little spatulas to use in all my canning jars. Love the colors and the number included to have some in a second drawer to always be handy.
Very unique tools. I use these for my soap making and I've found they have a combination of uses. They are easy to clean and very helpful while scrapping the sides of the pot/bowl for access ingredients with out damaging or ruining them. I like the different colors to keep track of what ingredient touch that paticular tool. I like the heavy duty feel of quality. I'm sure if taken care of they will last a long time.
I was wondering what I was going to do with 5 of them but I'm finding I use them constantly so it's nice to not have to dig them out of the dishwasher. Very happy with this purchase.
I love these! They scrape the last little bit out of a can of soup. Then I can grab another one to help cook something on the stove. It's great that they came with so many or them. I didn't know how much I would have used these until I had so many I could actually pick and choose based on the color I wanted to use that day. Once I started I found this is my go to item for pretty much everything.
"Finally a small, soft, strong Silicone Spatulas. I had only one small soft Spatula that.. I used and had washed all the time. Now I just grab, use, and toss it into the dish washer knowing there is another clean one in the silverware draw. Love this product."
I‚Äôm so happy I decided to purchase this set of spatulas! They are the perfect size for any bowl and really make scraping batter out so easy! These are by far my favorite spatulas!
"I love these little rubber spatulas because for quick uses, they're so easy to clean. I had a set from Target, that eventually split at the head from use. These are a great replacement.. better in fact. They are still bendy, but not as bendy as the target ones so I think they will last longer. I love the variety of colors. 10/10!!"
I really love these. When I first opened up the package I was disappointed in the size. I have learned they are great and work as well as the larger ones. The best part of being shorter is that they fit in the silverware rack in the dishwasher!
"I was worried that I only needed one spatula and that buying these was excessive, but I seriously recommend these 100%. I‚Äôm constantly grabbing them for everything, so it‚Äôs nice to have 5. They are super sturdy and the perfect size for anything. Not so big that they take up too much space in a drawer. They also withstand any amount of heat without melting."
"They are great for getting the last little bit of Ultra Violet ink out of your flexographic ink trays or chambers. The ink beads up on the spatula making it easy to white off with a rag. It holds up to acetate, alcohol, and water base solvents. I recommend these for narrow web flexographic ink well clean up. Have not used this in solvent base ink or water base ink but imagine it would work just as well."
"These are so useful, and I love all the colors! I looked everywhere at the Mall and finally got some that turned out to be so stiff that they are basically non-functional in spite of their lovely floral patterns and wooden handles. These silicon ones are much cheaper, just as good-looking, and most importantly, they work very well for myriad kitchen chores."
"A good set of small silicone spatulas - perfect for making scrambled eggs, which is mostly what I‚Äôm using them for."
I thought I wouldn't like these because they're smaller than my other rubber spatulas but after using them for a few months I've noticed I ALWAYS go for these when I open my cooking utensil drawer. I'm ordering more!
We got one of these as a gift in a swag bag. It's become a go-to kitchen item which was used several times a day so I bought these so we always have a clean one ready to use.
"I've bought a few kinds for mixing royal icing and I wish I would have just spent the money and bought a couple sets of these. The only negative as noted before is the extra silicon at the top handle...but it has no bearing on the usefulness of the product. Super sturdy yet flexible to work icing around the bowl. Love these! Great size also...not too big, not too small!"
"I use these for stirring items that are cooking, scraping bowls or jars. Easy to clean and enough of them so that I can use multiple spatulas while preparing several items. Great size - I love these spatulas!"
these are the best small spatulas I have ever found. colors are great and the fact that they have metal in the handle makes it hard to break or bend. I use them every day and now my sister in law wants me to order a set for her.
"We like the size, flexibility and non stick aspect. This is our second order. My one star deduction was that we had the metal shaft rip though one and we don't know why. We're not pushing them very hard."
These were exactly what I needed! They are very easy to clean and are in deed hear resistance.
"We had the traditional rubber spatulas with the plastic handle but they were getting gross and moldy in the creases. I am so glad we found these one piece spatulas. They have been such a breeze to clean, fun colors, and come in a variety of sizes. We are very happy with them."
I have some other spatulas but these fit my hands so much better and are much more comfortable to use. I use them for all sorts of things and they clean up beautifully in the dishwasher. Easy to find in a full drawer of other utensils.
"These spatulas are the best! I use multiple a day. They‚Äôre perfect for making things like eggs and sauces and for get the last of the mayo or peanut butter out of the jar. I love that they are all one piece, so they are extremely easy to clean. My kitchen would not be complete without them. They make a great gift too!"
"This is a nice size spatula for cat food cans.. I like to clean them out well, and a spoon does not do as good of a job. So they are great for what I wanted them for. They are not long wood ones like they made when I was 'young'.. and the blade is narrower-- so not super strong for heavy jobs.. but perfect for my use.. even a little smaller would have been good."
"Love the colors. They are very nice and sturdy. One piece so super easy to clean. I‚Äôm quite pleased with these, only wish they also had a purple one. Lol"
"These are great little spatulas - perfect for mixing ingredients, scraping out bowls, and so much better to clean than the ones that have removable heads. There‚Äôs no hidden gunk since it‚Äôs all one piece. And 5 spatulas in bright colors!"
Used it today for the first time! Scooped out Tomato paste from that small 6 ounce can. Worked very well. You can never get all of it out with other utensils! Gave a couple to neighbors.
"I had gotten a set of three silicone spatulas, and found that I used the smallest one alot, so it was always in the dishwasher. I went looking for a second one, and found this set of 5. They are a little thinner at the top edge than the first one, but that hasn't been a problem for my purposes. The colors are great, and I have enough to put one or two in Christmas stockings this year."
These are perfect. One solid piece with no nooks or crannies to trap food. Easy to clean. Very pleased with this purchase.
These little spatulas are so handy and work beautifully on multiple tasks. The small size is never an issue. They wash clean in a snap. I find myself reaching for them every time I‚Äôm cooking.
"I bought a set of these once before and really like how well they scrap bowls clean, mix and spread various types of food. This was my second purchase for a vacation home. Very satisfied with my purchase!"
"I had silicone spatulas with wood handles. Putting them in the dishwasher ruined the handles. These are all silicone, making them perfect for me. I use them to spread butter, scrape out bowls, spread mayo, etc. Love them."
Small spatula size is easy to handle and perfect for scraping contents from a variety of sizes in dishes and containers. Easily cleaned by hand or in dishwasher.
These colorful spatulas are great for getting ingredients out of measuring cups & spoons. Each one is a solid piece of silicon.which I really like. I have other small spatulas with wooden handles that can separate from the silicone top. The fun colors bring a smile to my face!
I‚Äôm a foodie and I cook a lot. These are my go to for everything! I got them their own crock to keep out on the counter. Kitchen must have
These are my favorite. Small and easy to use and clean. Don‚Äôt melt when I stir the food in the pan.
"These mini spatulas are the perfect size in the kitchen. Easy to grip, can get into jars and pots right down to the very bottom and corners, and bright and colorful."
They are perfect! Just a bit bigger then the size of cereal spoons. Small enough for me to mix my Buttercream in small bowls and have it fit perfectly inside the piping bags.
These little spatulas are flexible and some of my larger ones are stiff. They are pretty in the various colors and seem well made.
"These spatulas are the right size for mustard jars, scraping down the last bit of mashed potatoes from the pot, or making Steak Marsala. Big ""ones"" have their use, little ""ones"" fill the gap. And the price is right."
"These spatulas are a good size and very handy when I am cooking or baking bread. I use them a lot and have two sets. They are useful and easy to clean, as well as being reasonably priced. I highly recommend this product."
Durable and perfect for my cast iron skillets.
"These spatulas are longer and wider than those found in our local stores. I especially like the offset angle and the smaller spatula's beveled edges. Sure makes it easy to get that first brownie or piece of cake out of the pan! We've discovered that these spatulas can handle the extra heat on the grill plates. They have a semi-smoothe surface which keeps food from easily sliding off. We wash ours by hand, but they can go in the dishwasher."
"We live in a warm weather state and cook on the grill all of the time. I have to admit that when I opened this package I was disappointed, however, once I used them I realized just how good these spatulas were. They are sturdy enough to flip a fairly large steak."
We are very pleased with this set. Exactly what we wanted.
"I purchased these spatulas to use on my cast iron griddle. They are perfect! Well made and heavy duty. They weren't kidding when they said ""professional"". I will use these on my gas grill also. No need to worry about these falling apart. I found the price to be very good for these two spatulas. I will recommend them for sure!"
"Fast delivery came when expected. These spatulas are quality made. The small one serves a duel purpose, it's a spatula and scraper. I used them 5 minutes after they were delivered. Thank Anmarko. I will look for your items by name. I hope that you put more grilling items out."
"Well, I'm not a professional Chef, but I am the proud owned of a new Genesis II Weber Grill. . And I'm the new owner of a ""flat top"" or Plancha."" grate for it. So these tools look just like I've seen professional chefs use on TV and in every restaurant I've been to. Haven't used them yet, but I'm sure these solidly made tools will work just like I expect. The only problem may turn out to be between the handle and the grill...me :)"
"I only received one when it clearly states two. The Amazon robot took my complaint and filed it in the we dont care folder. The quality is great on what I got; just wish the other one came with it. Update, the company contacted me immediately and agreed to send me a replacement one. THANK YOU again. I strongly recommend this."
"If you're making smashburgers, this set is essential. The flipper is the perfect size for pressing down on the patties and the scrapper has a great edge to loosen them up on the flat-top right before flipping."
Way better than the older versions. This is my 2nd pair and I‚Äôve given them as gifts with great feedback. Highly recommend.
"I bought this set specifically because I needed a long spatula to replace one which had broken. When this set first arrived, I was disappointed that the new spatula was so long and it was narrower than the old one. But I have found that it is very good for things the old one wasn't so I am quite pleased with it. The smaller one is great - it makes a terrific lasagna cutter."
"I purchased this set because I wanted a long spatula for making Steak & Cheese sandwiches on the griddle. The long spatula is just perfect for that task. These are both sturdy, high quality kitchen tools. I was very happy with this purchase."
The handles do feel a little cheap when I first got them but after using them awhile they have held up well and one of the few that have the hole in them so to hang. The scrapper works alright but rather use my other one I have. I use the small one more for a small spatula and less a scrapper though it can do the job if needed.
Comfortable handle attached to a nice heavy piece of steel. Smaller one has sharpened edges. Good value.
"Excellent set of spatulas, every bit the ""Professional"" set as described. The handles are solid vinyl, so may not withstand sitting on the side of the pan directly but the metal portion of the spatulas is solid and beveled on the edges, making it easier to scoop underneath whatever it is you're cooking up. I just used the shorter one tonight on fish and it was better than using my old wok spatula. These are both quite long and wider than it might appear in the pictures, so you won't find them wanting in any way unless you're looking for an actual shovel. Highly recommended!"
"I love both spatulas, the hamburger spatula with a sharp edge for scraping is excellent and it fits right in your hand perfectly, as well as what I call the pancake spatula, long and easy to flip pancakes my wife loves them too. I am so glad I found this on Amazon. I highly recommend these. Alexander Tays"
"These are fantastic. The sizes are great and they are heavy duty enough to lift out a large serving of lasagna, for example, without any spilling over the edges. Also great on my indoor grill. I couldn't be more pleased."
"These seem to be very high quality and were great for making ""Smash Burgers"". We will see how they hold up to use."
"I sought a long-bladed pancake turner to replace one I'd owned for many years but whose handle broke. I found the one I purchased but could only purchase it as part of a set of two different sized spatulas, only one of which I actually needed. Further searching on other sites turned up a single such pancake turner but at the cost of the two spatula set. I chose to get the set because I'd be getting the one I originally wanted and another which I might find a use for in the future. I like both. The s/h was free. The package came when I was told it would. It was a good deal."
"I purchased this set for use with a new griddle on my grill. Wow, what a difference these made over the grill spatulas and other tools I had tried before. The turner is is quite strong, with just a little bit of flex. The long shape of the turner allows me to turn several items at once (slider/burger patties, sliced vegetables, toasted rolls, shrimp, you name it!). It is also really nice for flipping long fish fillets. The scraper is thicker, quite stiff, with beveled edges - great for scraping the griddle after use, but also useful chopping things while cooking, or ""helping"" the long turner flip things over. . I find I am now using this set in other cooking - ""regular"" grilling, flipping items I am broiling in the oven, etc... The construction is excellent. Very comfortable grips. All that, and they are dishwasher safe! I am very happy with my purchase. Very useful set, great construction, and a wonderful price. I highly recommend them."
I love the large size. Excellent to turn and lift larger pieces s was hen cooking.
This is a simply and hygienically built pair of spatulas. The stainless has plenty of thickness to it giving it strength and very little (if any) flexibility. The edges are also well sharpened (for a spatula) so they will cut through some stuff well without having a fine edge to get chipped or dented.
"I love these so much, they are great to cook with. Ive had mine for a while now and tjey look brand new after so many uses. They are easy to cook with."
"The long spatula is great, but the shorter one got rust spots after first use/wash."
Great for top grillwork and making cheesesteak sandwiches. Handy for keeping the food in place before placing it on bread or serving on plates.
We needed to replace our wooden handled spatulas as they were non-compliant in our commercial kitchen. These arrived in three days thru Prime. They are of a good weight and are getting the job done. Dishwasher safe is a plus. Our cook is well seasoned (get it? lol) and found them to be of good value.
"Good items. Durable. Even the weirdly long one seems to work well. The square one is very sharp and strong which is good for scraping things. A little sharp at the corners which scratches through the seasoning on my cast iron pan if you are not careful. All in all, useful."
I love to cook on a cast iron griddle. These are pretty much the perfect tools for what I do. The scraper makes quick clean up on my griddle and the size of the long spatula make plate size pancakes a reality. These are really good quality for a more than reasonable price.
"Good product, appear to be sturdy and well constructed.  It is also handy to have one tool you can use as a spatula plus being a grille/griddle scraper!"
Sturdy and easy to use.
These are substantial kitchen tools! I purchased this to replace a Pampered Chef Metal Spatula and I can say the quality seems just as good. Best part I got both tools for less than what it would cost for me to order a new PC one!
"I worked in restaurants for over 20 years and I just can't cook with ""houseperson"" tools. I need something sturdy and well made like these. Feel good in the hand."
"These are the best spatulas I've ever owned. They are thin with a tapered edge, which makes them perfect for grilling and baking. I actually bought three more because they are so useful."
"I bought these for my husbands new flat-top grill. He LOVES them, and watching him try to spin them around like a hibachi chef was worth every penny spent üòÜ! They look and feel very nice... not flimsy or cheap."
Just what I wanted
I wanted a spatula with a long surface. This set includes that plus a standard length plus a chopper/scraper. All very sturdy and the same quality as you find professionals using at restaurant grills.
"Easy to handle, durable and a snap to clean! Love them."
I purchased this set for my husbands birthday. He loves them! He was well overdue for some nice grilling utensils and use for cooking in his cast iron pan. They are very well made but light as a feather.
This spatulas were heavier duty than I expected and work great with my Blackstone Adventure grill.
"I used to be a fry cook and I can tell you that I appreciate a good set of long spatulas. These work great, of good construction, have holes, and are the perfect size for camping. No so small thst they are useless, but not so large they are unwieldy."
This long metal spatula works well as a painting tool for me. Picture using it as a really large pallet knife! The shorter one will probably be used in the kitchen.
"Very sturdy, nice sharp edge. Perfect for flipping anything from burgers to over medium eggs on my Blackstone griddle."
"My husband bought himself a hibachi grill. These are perfect for him to show out his skills to everyone making fried rice, flipping burgers and is willing to cook more often. Makes me really happy."
"I use cast iron a lot in my cooking, and these spatulas are spectacular together with the iron. Very sturdy, great construction... I anticipate years of use."
Nice tool
Was needing a longer spatula for grilling and using the outside griddle. This set is great. My husband and I like to cook with good quality utensils.
I am so impressed with the quality of this set of spatula's. Perfect for use with cast iron skillet and stainless steel skillet for turning fish or heavy items!
Works great and sturdy
"Nice, wide, & long"
This set is very well made and very sturdy. Works great on my outside flattop cooktop. Great price too. I highly recommend.
"They are great for flipping foods, pancakes especially."
They are good quality. Nice weight in the hands.
My wife bakes cakes for special occasions and wanted something to help here move a cake from the icing pedestal to the cake box. The large Anmarko metal spatula is perfect for that. She loves it. It's large and sturdy enough to move a good-sized cake.
These are of excellent quality. Look no further.
Looks professional grade. Great accessory for flat-top cooking.
"Great product, very heavly built, should last a long time"
I just got these for camping this week and I love them. They are professional grade. If I remember to update after I have been using them awhile I will.
We recently installed a cooktop that has a flat top on it. These were the PERFECT tools for it ‚Äî we liked them so much that ordered a second set
My husband is the baker in the family and bought these for the annual Christmas Cookie Baking Extravaganza. He is very please with the quality of the spatulas. Definitely sturdy not flimsy....
"This product is very well made. Very sturdy, easy to clean. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend."
I bought the set just for the rounded one--it fits the bottom of our large cast iron work perfectly.
"Great for making machetes, bbq's, happy to have them@"
"Just receive this order. The quality is apparent and they will work fine with everything from grilling, pan frying, and chopping as needed (a strong, sharp edge)."
"I bought this for my husband. He loves the largest one. He uses the large one often to flip eggs, make omelets, flip hamburgers, ‚Ä¶."
"These are good spatulas that hold up to every day use. So far the metal is secure to the handles, and there's no warping nor discoloration on the metal."
"I bought these to go with my new grill top. They work perfectly. I can now flip pancakes, fish fillets and everything else so much better than before."
easy install perfect fit.
I just got these so only time will tell but both metal spatulas are solid feeling and the metal is not flimsy. I paid less than $20 for the set and have no problem suggesting them at that price.
"This is what I was looking for, expectations were met and now I'm all set to cook in my 24"" disk wok."
the handles are sturdy enough to withstand bbq use while the blades are strong and easy to clean up.
"MY SET OF MICHAELANGELO SILICONE SPATULAS ARRIVED IN ONE DAY IN A HARD CARDBOARD BOX WHICH PROVIDED EXCELLENT PROTECTION DURING SHIPPING, AND THIS COUNTS. WITH SILICONE AT TOP AND BOTTOM AND STAINLESS STEEL IN BETWEEN, THIS IS A WONDERFUL SET AT ANY PRICE, LET ALONE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS. YOU CAN FLIP EGGS, A STEAK OR FRY POTATOES IN AN INSTANT. ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS A FINE AND STURDY PRODUCT, AND AMAZON IS JUST SO FAST AND EFFICIENT."
"I got tired of always getting spatulas that melt on the end where you scoop or that are just not wide enough for a pancake or grilled cheese. Problem solved with these guys. They are monsters! Not just wide but some are long too. I love them! The only drawback is yes the turner part itself is heat resistant but the handles are not. I had one resting on the edge of the pan and it put a melted line in the handle. But even knowing that I would still buy these, they are that great."
"The absolute best non-stick spatula set I have ever purchased, and at 69 years of age, I have purchased a lot. They deserve more than 5 stars for sturdiness. Especially liked the variety of sizes. Would have liked the addition of a smaller one but nothing to complain about."
"For some reason, the past turning spatulas we have purchased ended up ripping right where the metal ended. These have held up very well and you get 4 legitimate (1 is very large!) spatulas for a great price!"
"It's all good,,,, would like to order a cook pot,, small one,,,, didn't have to wait long‚ù§Ô∏è I am on social security,, and will at least order what I need,,, feels like Xmas thank u"
"I love these spatulas! Yes they're bjg, but they're so well made and so flexible they're extraordinarily easy to use. I've used them constantly since I got them and I don't know how I got by without them all these years... Highly recommend!!!"
I just got for Christmas so the test of time is not complete. However they seem to be a good sturdy set.
These are the best spatulas. No scratching my beautiful ceramic cookware.
"nice set of spatulas. assorted sizes for different projects, from narrow to wider. good deal."
"Have no regrets - these utensils are easy to use and clean. They are also very heat resistance and don't scratch up my pans. For the price too, these were a great purchase."
"I haven't used them all yet, but I have found one I go to repeatedly. Really good value for the money."
Nice variety of sizes. Love the high heat resistance.
just what was needed
A tad bendy for my taste but that's to be expected for silicone. Still a great product.
"Heat resistance is fine. Easy to clean? I guess. But these things are the biggest spatulas you have ever seen. I hope you have a garage to store them in. A cookie jar on top of your counter won‚Äôt do! These will just flip out of that sad cookie jar. Want to flip some eggs? Well they will most likely slide right off before you can flip because these things are huge. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, perfect for a pancake then? Nope. They will slide right off too. Skip these and buy something (anything) else."
Easy to use and sturdy
I really enjoy cooking with them
Several of the utensils are very large.
N/A
"I bought the silicon turners because my previous metal one left many scratches on my non sticky pans. My first worry was the heat resistance, after 1 month use, it turns out they work just fine for regular stir fry and barbecue. The price is also very competitive to other similar products. So if you are looking for a cookware set that protect your non sticky coating, this is a great choice."
"I didn't pay attention to the dimensions given, but they are larger than I thought they would be. They are made of silicone, so they are a little floppy that I did not expect. I think they will work fine, just larger than I am used to using. Should have no problem flipping pancakes and omlets."
"I have used 2 of the 4 so far. They are sturdy enough to flip eggs, sandwiches, etc, but flexible enough to easily go under the item I am cooking. I have run them through the dishwasher and washed by hand - both were easy. So far I really like these - they are replacing other less useful spatulas"
"I wanted quality spatulas instead of the cheap ones I had been using so ordered these. I should have checked the measurements because all but the small one are larger than typical spatulas. I don't like how flexible the silicone is on the large ones. I lowered this to a 3 today because the small one, which I have been using, is now having the metal split through the silicone."
"Most of these spatulas are wonderful - strong and able to pick up all items (last 3 photos), but one is softer, and not really able to be used for heavier items (first one, with text). It would be a good idea to insert reinforcing, as the others have for this spatula too - even though the available area for that is smaller than on the other spatulas. All in all, I am very happy with my new spatulas! Didn't realize how beaten up the older ones were."
"Sorry, I was expecting regular size utensils, and these are just huge. I returned a previous set, and thought these were smaller, but they aren't, they just have shorter handles. They might work for commercial use, but I had to return them because I don't need huge tools."
Flexible without being floppy. Easy to clean. I particularly like the tongs. Very pleased with this product.
Solid support throughout but seem to be flexible enough for pancakes. Great silicone rather than plastic or other that melt or crack like our other ones.
These tools are beautiful as well as being very functional. They are high quality tools. They are so easy to wash that I do not put them in the dishwasher. I have used them often and they still look like new.
"Too pliable. Not the easiest to use, as front edge is soft rubber. Bends to easily."
I will probably only ever use the smallest turner. The rest are huge. Not thrilled but I did read where people talked about the size and I ordered them anyway.
They are all pretty big. I was wanting smaller ones. Nothing sticks to them
Made very well. Use on my outdoor griddle. Happy with with these things. May have to get another set for in house!
i was very surprised at the quality! i am pleased with these utensils!
"Going to donate them , they are really flimsy not good to cook with I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone buying them"
The silicone is soft and rather difficult to wash/clean but it is not a big issue.
"Was surprised by the quality. Haven‚Äôt used them a bunch yet, but I‚Äôm happy with them so far."
How did I survive cooking all these years without these different sized spatulas???
Wish they were made in USA . Work on getting USA manufacturing
Filled the void for every spatula we needed! Strong and durable top!
Great addition to my kitchen. Durable yet stylish.
Really like these spatulas clean well and sturdy.
Fast delivery Great item
Great quality at a price that's reasonable.
Great product
"The tang, or metal handle part that is embedded in the spatula itself, is really too short and just trying to flatten out hamburgers (1/4 lb ground beef with nothing added) has caused 2 to pop out the underside. This makes the spatula unusable from then on. Really not sturdy enough for regular use. We are so disappointed as they seemed so good initially. One broke after one month and then the next failed after just a few months of use (not even daily use!). Now need to replace these but won't buy these again."
Flips my pancakes just fine.
Actually lays flatter than most utensils.
Bigger than I thought they would be..but happy with them
Good quality.
Easy to use for small hands but covers big areas in pan
These things are massive. I sent them back
Very versatile & easy clean up
"Product is as expected, no issues."
So far they are quite good. Time will tell.
Very sturdy
Larger than I was looking for.
Love the size!
Too big and floppy
Sturdiness
Fantastic
"They seem of decent quality, just not sure what you would use them for....they are huge"
ease of handling & cleaning
Love the quality
Perfect
We haven't had these spatulas more than a few months the the handle fell off one. The tang only extended one inch into the handle and one day it just slipped out while making grilled cheese sandwiches.
These were way to large for me will probably only use the smaller one.
"I have been looking for about 5 years for a good spatula, and now I have a few. I‚Äôm very particular of cooking utensils and couldn‚Äôt be happier with these. Thank you"
These are flimsy. My husband even commented on them. üò¢
Made to last
The set contained all the items I actually use and not what the manufacturer needs to get rid of which is ofter the case with sets of any kind.
Very good quality set! Strong stainless steel does not bend or warp. Brass rivited wood handles are half-tang but holds tight. Nice assortment for oudoor cooking with cast iron. Especially liked the added nice touch of the added hand chopper. It has measurement conversion tables on 1 side and linear measure on the cutting edge on the other side.
Have had this awesome Spatula set for a several of weeks now and I love them. They are a great size and a nice variety. I use them with my new Blackstone 36 inch Outdoor Flat Top Gas Grill Griddle Station and they work great! Do not put them in the dishwasher. The handles won't like it!
"These are very nice restaurant quality spatulas. They are much bigger than I expected, but I didn't read the dimensions. It was a good purchase."
Great for outdoor griddle
"When I was a high school kid in the early 70s, I worked for McDonald's. (Didn't most HS kids in those days?) So, I cut my spatula chops flipping thousands (seemed like billions) of hamburgers. Many spatulas today try to be too fancy. A single shiny piece of stainless steel with a rubber-coated handle. Ick. No thank you.  I was raised on spatulas with a nice wood handle riveted to a platen with beveled edges. Over time, the wooden develops a nice patina. It's a tool, not a piece of kitchen art.  THIS IS AN EXCEPTION SET OF SPATULAS for the utilitarian, no frills person. Great for the kitchen. Great for the BBQ. I'll probably buy several more sets ... some to give as gifts and some to safekeep so that I have a lifetime supply.  Oh, and yeah, the price is unbelievably cheap. If they're sold out, it's because I bought out the remaining supply."
Excellent product and I've already use them on my new griddle. They work great!
"We haven't had it long so can't speak to say if they hold up to no rust...but we love what is included in the package. The only thing I would say we are missing is the silicon egg rings for the griddle. This was the only package I saw with great reviews that had the 4"" spatula. I think it is awesome to have the versatility of sizes on the spatulas."
Love this set! Perfect for our griddle bbq!
"I own a deli we have a grill, I ordered these spatulas for it and they happen to be good quality."
"The scraper is my favorite of the set. Lightweight and good wooden handle. Glides over my grill and easily cleans off food particles. The spatulas are a good size. I grill a lot of vegetables and steaks, so each has a niche of its own."
"These are my ""go to"" kitchen utensils. Sturdy, hi-quality. Love love love the large spatula which doubles as a scraper on my cast iron baking pans and large skillets. The edges are so thin they're almost sharp - great for flipping pancakes and getting under those large chicken. Great wooden handles. I take good care of these tools and wash them by hand."
Have used frequently for over a month. Really like the overall sturdiness. Had originally purchased different brand with plastic handles. Returned because thin metal flexed and plastic handles looked like they would break sooner rather than later. Appears to be good value for price.
There isn‚Äôt anything I did not like about this product it works very well I have my granddaughter making pancakes with them she had no problems using them at all they cleaned up very nicely thank you
"I used these for the first time this past weekend and have no complaints at all. Only time will tell on how long they last, but I feel confident they will hold up just fine."
"I was able to use all of these tools shortly after receiving the shipment. Easily went under steaks and burgers. Was able to cut, control during lift and turning over. Slid off when tilted and stayed centered when lifted even at a slight angle. I really like this set? Easy to clean and hang with knives and spoons."
Unfortunatelyy dad never saw his father's day gifts cause he passed away. I used it tho and it works well. Thank you
These spatulas are more than just good looking the are well balanced and a nice weight. They were just what I needed for my outside grilling. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good set of spatulas.
"I purchased a griddle several months ago and I wanted tools that would help me with cooking. I ordered the spatulas with the griddle and found that they exceeded my expectations. I am considering to purchase them again just so I have sufficient tools when I need them. Great buy, I would reco9mmend them to everyone."
Really like these they are sturdy with wood handles actually have some weight to them NOT flimsy like some other spatulas
Spatulas are very strong and sturdy plus you get lots of extra goodies like the sauce bottles good value
This set is awesome! I smoke meat and bbq a lot. The long spatulas come in handy for chicken breast in smoker. I also use them on my iron skillets. The price is unbelievable for what you get!
So far so good!!! We get these reviews so close to the date of purchase. We need more time with the product. But like I said in the short amount of time I‚Äôve had these spatulas they seem to be fine. I‚Äôm using them for my griddle.
"As a master home cook, these have amazing uses!! You can scrape your cast iron pan when saut√©ing say garlic to get all those delicious flavors!! I also use the big one on the gasgrill"
"They are really great and I think a must have for frequent cast iron pan users! We haven't tried them on the grill yet, but I think these spatulas should make turning and flipping food very easy. I can't believe it took me that long to try them out! Great variety of sizes, too!"
They work the way they are supposed to. They are sturdy and do not bend while using. They clean up very easily. The three sizes meet any of your cooking or grilling needs. Highly recommend.
They don't really have much Bend or Flex to them but they are great for making Smash Burgers.the quality is great and they are easy to clean.
Great I have a set and just bought my son a set great for out door are indoor cooking
A gift to my son-in-law he really really loved it very sturdy he like the wooden handle very sharp that was amazing
If you grill on heavy duty equipment you'll appreciate these tools.
"These are quite nice and very sturdy. Bought for camping actually, but some might end up in my home. They are a little big, but I've found it handier than I thought."
"Real commercial quality, not cheap junk. Scraper has a ruler on it"
"Seems to be a good product. There is some flex to the spatulas, which is good, but sturdy enough to do good smash burgers."
"Well-made products. Had purchased one before and decided I wanted another large one to match what I had. My neighbor liked it as well, so I bought this set to split with him."
Multi purpose grill use.
This is great product everything we needed for our new flat iron grill I am happy with my purchase
"This product is sturdy, well made, and easy to use."
This is a great combination pack that had everything I needed for making everything from omelette to delicate fish filets. It‚Äôs sturdy enough to smash ground beef for smash burgers. Good buy.
"Great product, great price."
Good quality product
Bought these for my black stone and love them
Love this product
"Excellent for the smash burgers my son cooked for us, the blades are wide and heavy. The blades are beveled, which helps when turning food. Nice rivets holding the handles to the blades. Overall a great product"
Love the sturdy feel.
Seems to be very sturdy and strong. Heavyweight.
"I love these Spatulas! They are great for flipping anything, so precise, over easy eggs with stainless compared to plastic, well there is no comparison. These are great to cook with, easy to clean and very attractive"
"I love this spatula set. The ends are sharp and can cut through chicken or steak. I use them on my griddle and they work great! The two bottles are great as well. I filled one with oil and the other with water for a camping trip and was worried they would leak, but they didn‚Äôt leak a drop! Great product overall"
These spatulas are sturdy and they work well for what we need. I hand wash them since they have wooden handles. We have used them 3 times and they still look and feel as good as new.
I just love the weight and comfort of these. I may need another set for my daughter so she doesn't slip mine into her purse. üòÇ
"Very Nice, more solid than I expected."
Handles on this set are very tight and feel good in your hand . Others I have are just loose so they had to go to the landfill .
There's nothing to dislike. The price great and quality is good too
Nice sharp edges on all spatulas. Appears to be well made. Can't wait to use them.
Well made! As advertised
Made my cooking for meals-on-wheels go a lot faster!
Great product!
These are a great value. I would like it if they were a little heavier but they do get the job done. Great for basic cooking needs like flipping a burger or flipping roasting vegetables. Would be a perfect set if one was a bit heavier to make smash burgers. Will have to purchase an additional one specifically for that purpose. Still a great set to own!
Looks like good quality!
I bought it for just incase spatula for my outdoor grill.......now is my wifes favorite
"Gave as a gift, was told they are great for camping and bbq."
Nice and solid!
"Very sturdy and strong construction, you will never have to worry about dropping food because of flexing."
"Not only was this an awesome gift i bought for my husband, but the shipping: wow i ordered them and then they were in my mail box the very next day!!!"
"I like the product, very sturdy. USE them all the time."
This things are nice and sturdy and I mean sturdy....very nice material ....the work great...love the different sizes you can use for a lot of different jobs...fajita for your tacos...smaller one for tortilla flipping....to scoop chopped veggies.... I really recommend them.
Good
"Great sturdy spatula set, not to be used for nonstick pans"
Good quality
I purchased this as a gift for a friend. For the cost you can‚Äôt beat it. There are other sets that cost more money but these were solid and seemed durable upon inspecting them when they first arrived. I would recommend this set for anyone looking for a cost effective and durable spatula set.
Great
Solid construction and will last me a lifetime. I like to buy items once and have no regrets. These meet those requirements. Ordered a 2nd set for lake house because there was no reason to think I can get better.
Quality product made in USA
"I have suffered the Ikea garbage cooking spoon set for years without any good reason. They were cheap, they did the trick, but they were not great. Finally I hit the wall. I got into a perfectly acceptable 40-something year old conversation about my favorite kitchen utensils and realized it was time to upgrade. I threw away all of my Midwestern sensibilities and replaced the cheap junk set with these. Man oh man. Have you ever delayed doing something for a long time, then you do it and think...what the heck took so long? This is one of those. Don't worry I donated the old stuff, so that the next generation of folks needing interim kitchen tools can get some use out of them. But I will never not buy this style of kitchen spoons/spatulas again."
"Great quality so I feel the need to take a moment to offer a review on these as they are absolutely the best spatulas I have purchased in years. Wanted these for macaron mixing and am very impressed. They are solid construction and there is no worry about the top bending over repeatedly and eventually falling off as so many others I've had. They are a sturdy, but not hard plasticky (for lack of a better description) quality which means they mix cookie doughs, frostings and sauces easily and effectively. Loved these so much I ordered another set for myself and then reordered 2 additional for my daughters as gifts. When you find good ones, it's always frustrating years later to not be able to find again...solved that issue. Another pro is the price. Far to often we hear: ""Poor performance with a low price and therefore you get what you pay for"" but in this case, the great price also came with a great product. To note: I selected the pink and mint colors for purchase and both were perfect!"
"When I received these, I thought the handles were quite sturdy with metal bar in the middle. But upon inspecting it there was a strange clear silicone/rubber on the outer edges, as if they didn't cleanly tear it out from which ever mold it was made in from the manufacturing process. I couldn't just take it off with hand, so I used a razor blade to shave it off."
These are definitely the ones you want. They are very versatile and don't scratch anything or peel with heat. They're also extremely easy to clean. I feel they'll last me for a very long time. I've no complaints. The small one I found is also perfect for spreading condiments while the bigger one that's flat is perfect for combining things in a bowl. The last one is generally great at mixing
"I had other spatulas with either wooden handles or plastic handles and they either broke or got very dirty where the spatula met the handle. these are all solid silicone construction, they are heat resistant, they are sturdy, and don't have a crevice that could become dirty. Have been really enjoying this set of spatulas"
"I'm not sure why the review questions asked if it was heat resistant, it's a silicone-like material, I didn't order it for that. But it works well for mixing all of my baking ingredients!! I love how it's all one peice so I don't have to worry about it coming apart or finding mold in weird crevices when I go to wash it!"
"These are great. You can leave them in the pan, laying against the edge and they won't melt or become too hot to handle. There all in one construction makes them easy to clean - the end never 'disconnects' from the handle. I wish I could find the one that is slightly spoon shaped in a bigger size."
"Nothing better for cooking than silicon tools, especially when you spend too much on good quality pots and pans. Yet, silicon still stains with time. Hence the color black. Hopefully they do not fade with time."
These spatulas definitely leave my bowls looking clean as hell when I'm baking! I love them so much and the colours are so beautiful üòç
"These are pretty good. They clean up well, do what spatulas do, and so far no problems with melting. Love the color too. Worth it."
My old spatula broke in half (probably because it was old) so I needed a quick replacement that wasn't too expensive. This was the perfect replacement!
"I cannot tell how well these will hold up, having only used them regularly for a few months, but they have not cracked yet. The color can only be described as happy and the three sizes are excellent."
"solid (so no breaking like my last silicone spatula that had a plastic handle that snapped), and very pretty color."
"I think it was these that had reviews of tattered edges. Mine don't have tattered edges. The edges are clean. But if they weren't, I'd just clean then up with a scissors. They very nice spatulas."
These spatulas are great quality. They are well made & sturdy. They definitely do not melt or get hot when left on a hot pan! That‚Äôs a bad habit of mine (oops!) I have melted so many utensils but I‚Äôm glad to know these ones will last!
"Love these spats. The color alone gives you pleasure. They are the soft ones, unlike the cheap ones that are often hard and don‚Äôt work as well."
So happy with these. My old spatula was two pieces and the silicone head kept flying off the handle or getting stuck in batter. I love that these are one piece. They work great. I purchased the dark gray and love the color. The sizes and shapes provide everything you need. My only regret is not buying them sooner!
"Haven‚Äôt used them in heat , I use them for butter spread the small one is excellent and to get everything out of mixing bowl. They worked for everything I needed"
"Love these. Love the price, the color and love its performance. Would purchase again."
"while this is a ""cheap"" price each piece is awesome. I have yet to try it to heat or dishwasher to know if they work well. I like how thick and sturdy they are. they only complaint is the strong smells stick to them even after I washed them 3 times to just get that smell off... but overall would deff purchase more again"
"Great price, pretty color, easy to clean. I love them, great for when I'm baking."
I didn't try the heat resistance quality yet but it is sturdy and easy to clean
"Sturdy for cooking, easy to clean, beautiful macaron blue. Held up to heat."
I like the one piece because they will not get black mold inside. I have used all the pieces-they are comfortable and sturdy. I stick them in the dishwasher to clean them.
My favorite thing is that they are one piece so no nasty build up between scraper head and handle.
"Very sturdy, easy to clean"
Great kitchen investment. Very easy to clean. They almost always still look spotless after use anyway. I love the different styles which allow for having the best tool in different situations. I can‚Äôt believe I went this long without a mini one... it‚Äôs the best at getting the last drops out of a can or jar. Buy these today!!
"This product is good quality, hit resistant, and so pretty they are strong but soft in the material and they don't get damaged or damaged my non-stick pants"
Been a couple of weeks since i bought these and they've been working great! Even stirred some tomato sauce on the stove and two washes later the staining came out. Color is accurate to the reference photo. Looks like these will last a long time!
Love these! Durable and do not melt when forgotten on side of hot pan!
"Nice variety of spatulas , they work great for different sizes of cans and pancake batter"
These come in 3 sizes Thisakes them uxeful for all kitchen tasks.
love color and work well mixing
"Love these, great quality and sturdy. I use these for my body butter business and they work great"
I‚Äôd been using a cheap spatula for years. I had no idea there could be such a difference in quality. Love these!!! (And the color makes me happy)
"High quality and great value for the price. Very nice color as well, and seems pretty resistant to staining so far."
Good for mixing dough for various dishes. Very sturdy. Good price.
"I broke all of my spatulas and was desperate to replace them immediately despite not really having a budget for it. These are my most often used kitchen utensils! I found this set of spatulas and bought them primarily due to the low price. I assumed I would not receive a quality product and expected to just tough it out until I could purchase more. I am so glad I was wrong! This trio of spatulas is well made, counter balanced, and all one piece! I did not know what I was missing! I will order more despite the fact that these are perfectly good. I cannot have enough good spatulas on hand, so I want to procure as many of these as possible! The price is as FABULOUS as the product!"
"Great set for a great price. I use this for baking and high-heat cooking and they hold up well, highly recommend."
"I like how sturdy the spatulas are! Heat resistance, and so easy to clean! Want to buy again"
"Easy to use, good color. Received item early."
These are cute and functional! I love the color of the light blue
These are sturdy and well made. Nice to have 3 sizes to choose from.
Good quality product. Love using these for mixing and cooking
It‚Äôs fine
"I love these spatulas, I accidently left it in the pan with eggs one morning, turned away and when I came back it was perfect. The small one is great for getting to the bottom of the peanut butter jar."
Worth your money and a good buy
Soft light teal color. Sturdy. Flexible. Cleans good. Works well.
I had to call my mom and tell her how awesome these were. I legit wrote home about them. Well worth the money! SUPER sturdy and easy to clean.
Nice color and sizes
Love the color and the size.
Does the job and great price. Durable.
These are so cute I love the color and it works great with practically anything! Very easy to clean as well!
"These may make a good first set for kids learning to cook. I thought they were all much too flexible for stirring anything more than anything thicker than water. I bought the set because I was looking to get a spoonula. I would stick with the Oxo red silicone spatulas. The Oxo spatulas do not flex much at all at the end. The purple color on these is just a little bit darker than the picture. Which I thought looked better in person.  I'm still looking for a purple spoonula. But for now I'll stick with the Oxo Red Spatulas. They've held up great and work very well. I've used them for mashed potatoes, sauces, moving vegetables in a pan, and even to help bring oven trays closer when I over zealously push them in too far."
Very sturdy and nice looking spatula set. Exactly as advertised and delivered on time.
"I wasn‚Äôt sure if the silicone would be easy to clean, but I used it with tomato sauce & it washed up perfectly!"
"I liked everything about these. They are easy to hold and do such a great job getting every little bit out of the pan, pot or jar. I highly recommend."
This product is exactly what I needed - lightweight and sturdy.
Great set of very sturdy spatulas!
They are everything you would ever want or need from a set of silicon spatulas. Must have for any kitchen. Buy them.
Love these. Replaced some older wooden handle version with these and I love them.
"I bought these primarily for the scoop spatula - I needed to replace my previous one that had been ""lost."" These function quite well - they have a metal rod in the handle which makes them rigid enough to stir even the heaviest pasta dishes. The two longer ones are 10.25"", the smaller one is 8"". The silicone is soft enough to adhere tightly to surfaces, providing a clean swipe; but not so floppy that they fold backward when stirring/cleaning up heavy foods. On the downside, the silicone is also the type that collects dust (see pic). And, as a personal preference, the scoop spatula is too shallow for my liking - it still functions well as a spatula, but I can't scoop anything with it, meaning I have to dirty a second utensil when I'm serving soups, macaroni salad, etc. Not a deal-breaker though, and I'm still happy with my purchase."
"Great value, just what I was looking for"
Love these! Love the colors too
This cooking utensils is very easy to cook with and easy to clean
Love that they are all one piece. Super sturdy.
Great quality and super cute!
Looks just like the picture- super cute color and good weight
"These seem sturdy and I like that they're one piece. They have just enough bend in the flat spatulas. My only issue is with cleaning them. Easy enough to throw in the dishwasher, but no matter the soap I use (even by hand), the scent won't wash off and it can seep into food. I'm going to have to buy an unscented dish soap just for these. I've used silicone spatulas for forever and haven't had this issue before."
Works just as advertised. 5/5
"I bought this for one reason, press hamburgers on the griddle like they do at steak and shake to obtain a crispy thin burger patty. The kids love this kind of burger. The steel on this product bends under the pressure. Maybe I am doing something this was not intended to do but it looked sturdy. I really like the edge on the front. I can unstick anything. Good product just not for my purpose. Updated- this has turned out to be a really solid item in my kitchen. The steel may bend if I put serious pressure on it but The construction and sharp leading edge offset any downsides. I now is it on my gril, skillets, and the leading edge as a way to cut quickly during prep. I hand wash and it still looks new after a few months of use. Uping to 5 stars for this reason. 2nd update- still going string my favorite utensil just make sure you don't let anybody put in the dishwasher by accident. Still looks awesome and still has a sharp edge"
"I needed a spatula that was stainless steel and big to turn pancakes and grilled cheese sandwiches. The ones I had, while good, were too small and pancakes would flop around, break and become distorted.  This spatula/grill turner, definitely does the job. Pancakes turn effortlessly. The top and left sides have a sharper edge to cut which is nice. I‚Äôm left handed so the right side would have been preferred. Overall a good buy at a great price.  I gave it 5 stars even with the following points you should know about.  It is big. Dimensions are listed accurately. Until it was in my hands I didn‚Äôt realize what that meant. Not a fault of the manufacturer.  The handle is a comfortable wood one. Nice to use. But I can‚Äôt place it in the dishwasher for easy cleanup. I knew that when I bought it and knew I had to hand wash. In hindsight I‚Äôd have sought out a dishwasher safe handle."
"In the days where everyone is fascinated by pretty looking overpriced cookware, this spatula shines through. I don't care if my cooking utensils look fancy and impress my guests, a bright red spatula will not make my food taste any better. This thing is the definition of utilitarian. Thick metal, sturdy construction, huge/sharp turning surface, and it's weighted to sit flat without tipping. Perfect for grilling/griddling. There's a reason you only see ugly pots, pans, and utensils behind the scene at a restaurant...they work!"
"I've used this a few times on my grill, but the one I got is a little short for hot grill work. It is PERFECT for my cast iron pans. I got this as a replacement for another metal spatula. I really like the construction. One piece of metal from tip to handle. The wooden grips on the handle are sturdy and I have not noticed any heat while holding it. I really like it. My only issue with it was when my daughter used it on a non stick pan. Yup, tore that pan right up....no longer non stick."
"I purchased this because I wanted a good spatula without holes.  Nicely balanced weight and works well on cast iron skillets.  The only downside is the wooden handle which makes me wonder how it will hold up in the dishwasher. I've been washing the spatula part by hand, put it in the dishwasher once and I think that may eventually ruin the wooden handle."
I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN I VISITED I USED IT.. BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AFTER.
"I love this spatula! Use it for cooking in my 10"" and 12"" cast iron skillets. The only thing it is lacking is a hole in the handle to hang it up, but otherwise great. I can just drill the hole if i want to. The rivets aren't wobbly, and the graded edge on all three of the spatula sides is very helpful. The actual metal itself is thicker than expected and is quite stiff, although not completely rigid. Definitely not super-bendy metal."
Very substantial. Nicely made. Does what they're designed to do!
"Heavy duty. Seems pretty sturdy with only slight flex. Excellent for the price. I use it for smash burgers, and it works pretty well."
Nice heavier rigid thick hamburger/pancake turner. Can use in the house or on a little grill
Just a little bigger than excepted but solid and well-made.
This burger flipper is great quality. This is not your average cheaply made flipper. It‚Äôs big too. I should‚Äôve considered just how big it is.
"This is a high quality item. Love it, why pay more."
Heavy duty. Won‚Äôt bend under ‚Äúsmash burger‚Äù pressure
This was a Father's Day gift and hubby really likes it. It's perfect for flipping burgers on the grill. Thank you.
Purchased this to make smashed burgers on cast iron - this works great for that. It's actually bigger than expected but I'm not complaining about that!
"I already had a steel burger flipper but this one is better. I saw a YouTube video where someone had this and had sharpened the front edge. I haven't done that, but it makes sense if you have cast iron or carbon steel pans. I have Teflon for my omelet pan so I wouldn't use this flipper. But for steaks and burgers - this is the one."
Very heavy duty. Quality spatula
"Very nice, good home size great for making smash burgers! Very sturdy"
This spatula replaces one that I‚Äôd had for thirty years. It‚Äôs a great value and I‚Äôd get another. One thing that made it better was drilling a small hole to accept a loop of paracord so it can hang off the BBQ.
"Despite the affordable price, it's really well made. Very sturdy, much nicer than the one my dad had for decades that I bought this to replace."
"I was a chef for a while and fell in love with these, finally bought my own, the edges are sharp so if you have kids, or little kids be careful. Very sturdy, still sharp after a month use with skillet daily."
"The spatula is now my go to cooking tool. Got it to make hamburgers, but now use it for french toast, eggs and anything else I make on my griddle. Good quality and the finish on the wood handle is holding up fine to hand washing."
"Solid. Well made. Nice and heavy. Correctly balanced: Rests on the blade, instead of rocking back on the handle, when you set it down on the grill. Edges finished nicely. I hand wash all tools with wooden handles, and I treat all wooden handles with coconut oil."
Finally I have a spatula that is strong and useful. Why didn‚Äôt I buy this sooner. And it‚Äôs edge is even and straight so every scoop is easy!
Great spatula. Very sturdy and easy to use with beveled edges. Nice wood handle.
"This spatula has an awesome weight to it, and the beveled edges makes flipping food easier."
Just started using my Blackstone griddle purchased two years ago. Bought this and the Blackstone spatula kit. This is great! I wish I could cook more food every day.
This turner is sturdy and cleans nicely. Great for the price.
"Once I used this turner, I wondered how I managed without it all these years! Whether I am turning shrimp on grill, removing biscuits or cookies from the cooking sheet, folding and serving an omelet or flipping pancakes, I am amazed at its versatility!"
"Cooking often in cast iron on the induction surface begs for this tool. Easily cleaned. Great for iron surfaces, not intended for ""coated"" pots and pans. Edges are tapered and allows safe and easy cutting or separation in the heat on the stove. Wooden handle stays cool. Tough piece of indoor or outdoor (I do both) equipment. Large enough for man-sized portions. I especially appreciate it at the cutting board when transferring fresh minced (with the proper knife) ingredients into the cooking pot."
"The only thing I see wrong out of the box is the fit of the handle. As you can see in the photo they didn‚Äôt line up the two pieces of wood that make the handle. But it‚Äôs still very usable for the occasional use I‚Äôll put it to.  I guess I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the size in the description lol. This thing is large, extra large I would say. It‚Äôs definitely good for a griddle our grill but not for my 10‚Äù iron skillet as you can see in the photo. I would have gave it two stars for the jacked up handle if Amazon had a category for that. I scored it as high as I did because it seems very sturdy, durable and a great value. Keep in mind I haven‚Äôt used it at all yet. Time will tell how it holds up but I suspect it will be fine."
Well Made and heavy duty. I use it in my cast iron cookware and on the pit and grill. Works like a champ and will take a beating!!
"Good weight, and I like how the edge is sorta sharp . Great for smash burgers."
Metal is very thick and does not flex. Edges are beveled. Better than expected at this price point.
"Sharp edges, sturdy, and well made. This is an excellent tool for cast, stainless and glass cook wear. Made fast work of flipping burgers or cutting lasagna."
Well built and inexpensive. I would purchase this again.
Heavier than I'm used to but work great.Easy cleanup too.
"Damn this thing is HUGE! Can't use indoors, but gave it to a friend for outdoor grilling. It's also got a cutting edge on one side for dual duty."
PERFECT! I finally found a spatula that does what it's supposed to do. The beveled edges allow you to get under eggs & pancakes or burgers on the grill.
If you like to try foods on a large indoor grill this will do the trick. It is to heavy and to big to use on a frying pan.
This thing is gigantic! I wanted a spatula to make omelets with but this is way to big. It is a very nice product. Heavy weight and I will use it for the grill instead and purchase a smaller one for omelet making. Shipping was fast and packaged well.
"Solid and easy to clean. I use this on my grill when a regular spatula is too small. No complaints thus far, makes flipping burgers and rolling brats a breeze."
All ok
Too wide.
Great utensil for flipping a side of salmon.
Yes. Very sturdy. Husbands favorite
Solid Product. I did have to file the end flat then redound the corners to use in my cast iron griddle. Now works great.
This spatula is a nice weight and is very long. You can scoop up 2 hamburger patties easily off the grill.
Large and heavy duty
"Works awesome on my camp chef griddle at scout camp. Bacon, french toast, eggs, it's the only tool you need."
Perfect for hamburgers.
Good tool to turn hamburgers. No more torn burger pieces. Good support under the burger.
Heavy duty and well made. They are just what I was looking for. Very well pleased with this purchase.
This baby is massive! awesome for the grill or for giant pancakes.
High quality
Nice construction! Essential for cooking in a stainless skillet / griddle.
This is perfect for our griddle. I love that it lays flat on the griddle without falling down.
Exactly what I was looking for. Heavy duty and stiff for my stainless pans and my grill.
This is a heavy-duty product that is great for BBQs. Quality product
Way bigger than expected. Other than that it's sturdy aND does the job.
Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He has been using it on the grill and says it was exactly what he wanted. Thanks!
Good and heavy construction. Just don't soak the handle.
"High quality, think steel, and sharp edges I love it"
"This is kind of a specialized cooking tool, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It has a number of good uses for baking or cooking. We will enjoy this for some time to come."
fast ship and exactly as described!
Very sturdy and well built.
Great for serving lasagna which was what it was purchased for
Flips a burger like no other and hasn't fallen apart yet
"I use this as a scraper, it is great!"
"My experience with Anmarko has been stellar!!! When my spatula set arrived the mid-sized one was a little loose in the handle, but usable. I wrote to them about what had happened, but didn't ask for a refund or replacement. I just thought they should know. Well, today I received a replacement for that spatula, plus a small one! I'm redoing my kitchen, & I will be ordering more from them!"
"Yes, even though these aren't perfect, I still gave 5 stars. I've had these spatulas for a little over a year. I use the smaller rectangular one almost every day, sometimes multiple times per day. I cook mostly on cast iron. I have used the larger rectangular one very little. In the photos, I tried to show the corners for comparison. The smaller one's corners are just slightly rounded after over a year of use. I have only ever hand washed these; they have never been in the dishwasher. In the photos of the handles, you can see that the smaller rectangular spatula handle has some slight separation, but it doesn't seem to be any looser than it was originally. Both the small rectangular one and the curved end one handles were slightly loose from the day I received them. It bugged me at first, but I am a bit OCD and just learned to live with the imperfection. The large one is rock solid. They are quite rigid, but there is a little bit of flex. They are not full tang handles, the steel ends just past the second rivet. Again, that doesn't seem to affect the quality.  I was completely fed up with the junk utensils from the box stores, and I searched for a quality spatula. I found this set of 3 that have worked great. I only wanted the smaller one, but I've found the other two to be useful at times."
"I can't thoroughly review this yet, as I just got them and washed them, ready to use, but they appear to be of good quality. I got them primarily to use with cast iron, which I am changing over to. They are a big larger than I expected, but should do great. My previous set of spatulas were plastic and about 3 years old and had begun to shred at the edges. I will keep them for pots that I have that cannot stand metal (ceramic coated), but these will be my go-to set."
"These spatulas are well made from thick stainless steel. They are exactly what I was looking for. You can flatten out burgers without them bending. The edges are beveled to allow them to slide under pancakes or burgers, etc. The handles are wooden and riveted to the spatula. There are three sizes to work with all types of food. Best of all, they were not real expensive."
"I was surprised when I received these 3 spatulas. They are so well made. They have a heft to them but not too heavy. Not so light either that you feel that they are made cheaply. Having three different sizes has been so convenient and they ""nest"" with each other so it makes storing them in a drawer a breeze. The spatulas are a perfect match to my homemade hash browns. So easy to flip/turn them over now. I use the spatulas for all other dishes when needed and I couldn't be happier. Not only are these spatulas high quality, they are priced so low for a set. At any other restaurant supply store you'd be paying way more for just one! It's truly a bargain. I have not put these in the dishwasher. All are washed by hand (as most really good kitchen implements should be... especially ones with wooden handles). If you need spatulas I highly recommend this set. I'll be buying more myself to gift to friends and family."
"Cooking on cast iron can requires tools that are able to mechanically separate cooking food from the cookware surface. These spatulas are up to the task, with thick stainless steel, varied widths for different food and cookware sizes, and beveled edges sharp enough to scrape up foods without being dangerous or dulling quickly. The wood handles are a bit bland and don't feel particularly good or bad. The metal is top notch. Highly recommended!"
This spatula set has three sizes. Small which fit in most of my skillets. Medium just as good fits in larger skillets and the large which we use more on the grill. It is great for flipping stuff on the grill. Nice to flip hamburgers and vegetables. These are very easy to wash with soap and water. The handle fix comfortable in my hands.
"This Stainless Steel Spatula Set is the best I've ever tried. really heavy gauge. I have other spatulas, but these really seem to work much better. I mainly got the set because of the rounded front the one has. I thought, my cast ironware is round, a rounded tip spatula should work better. And it does! Also, the thickness is about double of any of my other turners. I would definitely recommend enjoying this set."
"Excellent product, long reach for grilling burgers and other items that need turning. Sharp leading edge for loosening stuck items. Very sturdy with excellent wooden handles. The rounded edge Spatula is great for iron skillet cooking."
"Very sturdy, with well tapered edges. Nice durable handles. I use the large and small spatulas when making smash burgers on my cast iron griddle; the big boy to smash them flat, and tiny to help maintain a uniform thickness. Nice sharp edge sheers the burger of the griddle, maintaining the charred beef surface. Fairly large overall, the smallest of the three is still a large spatula in my experience, your mileage may vary."
I bought this set for my step-son who works as a chef. But I admit that I will be ordering a set for myself as the spatulas are well constructed and made of good material.
I really like these.. have only had a chance to use 2 of them but so far they are great. The balance on them is really good. They are nice and sharp for cutting while you stir or flip. I am sorry I waited so long to get them.
This product is a must have when I go camping for my flat grill. Makes breakfast foods easy and main meals like meat and potatoes easy to fry up. Highly recommend the material quality is impeccable.
"My wife and I enjoy cooking and the Anmarko spatulas are great for a variety of uses, from smashburgers to corralling omelets on the griddle. The largest size is especially good for making rectangular omelets that are easy to flip and fold. The wood handles provide excellent insulation and the blades are easy to clean."
The spatula is well made but the Dynamex delivery person did not followed the delivery instructions. He just dropped the package in the middle walkway of the house. Very exposed to the porch pirates. I gave Dynamex negative star.
"Very happy. I am extremely pleased with the ""heft"" and the varied sizes. The semi-sharpened edges make it excellent for stuck-on food. I use it on cast iron, but I don't use it on no-stick surfaces. I highly recommend."
"Nothing to dislike. This is a nice set of spatulas for the griddle. Been using it mostly for pancakes and gets under them really fast and smooth, and makes flipping them much easier."
"The variable sizes really is a great advantage when doing hibachi cooking on a flat-top grill. The utensils are very sturdy and the handles are the perfect size and angled to protect your hands. I would purchase these again if needed, but I bet they last a long time :-)"
"These are amazing. Typically using the smaller of the three in my kitchen, the other 2 will be perfect for the grill. My only complaint is the handles. Time will tell, not sure what kind of wood they are made of, but they seem sort of sketchy. Will see, the spatula itself is very sturdy."
"I have a gorgeous hand forged brawny steel spatula that my horseshoe made for me 30 years ago. These are the only utensil that comes close! Sturdy and with a quality handle, clean up well, good angle for easy manipulation of food. Wish I'd had this set decades ago!"
"These are exactly what I was after. We don't buy this sort of thing often and over the years managed to destroy all our older spatulas. These are very well made and while a bit overkill for us, perfect for barbecuing on the grill and other heavier jobs. I'm happy with them though."
"Durable, strong and have razor sharp edges! Perfect for chopping, mixing and scraping off a cast iron griddle. Yes well worth the money!  I use these for making smash burgers and other things on my flat top outdoor griddle. They are strong, not flimsy - even though sometimes that is what you need- but an excellent purchase. The handle is a little small for my band but not bothersome."
I have been a Chef for 45 years and these are of the same as we use in the Professional Kitchens.
"Back in the day, I was a short order cook and loved the spatula I used. I had totally forgot about that spatula until I stumbled upon these which are sturdier and the edges sharper than the commercial one I used. I'm really glad I found these."
"I wasn‚Äôt sure about these spatulas at first but when I got them and saw how sturdy they are, well I was impressed. These are very stiff and have sloped edges which make them easy to slide under whatever you are cooking"
"Wife loves them. Bought these after some generic spatula thing bent in the middle of transporting some steaks from griddle to a plate, disaster was narrowly averted, but we don't want to risk it again so I got her some better ones. These are nice, firm, and feel great. Hoping many good years out of them."
I didn't expect there to be so big.. many applications.. I LOVE these.. heavy duty. Looks like they will last a long time. Recommended .. would be good for outdoor grilling.. also has hole in handle for hanging up..
My husband recently bought a flattop griddle and needed better spatulas and we have found them! They are the size and structure he was looking for!
"The long round one is of limited utility in my view, but we've found use for the large size with pancakes and steaks, etc. The small size is excellent and why I bought the set. We've used them for maybe 4 months and have no complaints."
"They are heavy duty, have sharp edges that make turning foods easy."
This product is well worth the money
"These tools are perfect for both indoor and outdoor cooking. The metal plate is solid and works well. the only thing I would improve on is the wooden handle. The wood does not appear to be treated and may weaken after several washes. One option is to treat the wood with waterproofing after the fact. Aside from that, it's a good product."
I bought these to help make Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches. The long and large surface makes it easy to flip. Also you can live your Hibachi dreams with two of them in hand! They have a good weight to them as well.
These spatulas are well balanced and make it easy to manage items in several different cooking applications.
Looking to replace plastic in my kitchen and these are perfect. Good weight and rigidity.
"Nice, durable, not flimsy, just the right size handles!"
we were not able to get spatulas of the size to use on professional grils. the three are everything you stated and more they have the cutting edge to use in chopping up ground beef and sausage. they were used the day they arrived and everyday since.
In retrospect I only needed the small one as the other two are fairly large for most pans or skillets.
they are easy to clean and use.
"The three sides of this spatula are tapered to allow you to get under your food, or scrape burnt pieces off the surface. In addition, they are nice and hefty. spjatula runs into handle."
"I have been wanting a good turner for a long time, you just can't find them in stores. I am very pleased to own a professional turner so I can make perfect over easy eggs and large omelets, without tearing them up trying to get under them."
Good value
Bought these for my husband for Christmas to replace one that we had where the handle cracked. For the price of 1 replacement I got 3!!! The different sizes have been very helpful. Note the small one has sharp edges so be aware where you place in your drawer lol!
"No need to buy anything else. These are what you are looking for, unless of course, you need something for non stick."
These are great especially for the griddle.
"I bought this along with a cast iron patty press. These spatulas look and work great. I use them to flips burgers, and butter my buns."
I have used this set since I bought it and it works great. I am very pleased with my purchase!e
I bought these as a birthday gift for my husband. I received them very quickly and in great condition. My husband is very happy with them. They are good quality and look like they will last a long time.
i like
"Multiple sizes, easy use and clean."
It's nice but again it's a spatula. I don't get that excited... Maybe later in life
We really get a lot of use out of these! We have a Traeger which usually has multiple items cooking.
They work well with my cast iron skillets. I believe they would be good on a griddle also.
"I got tired of my spatulas bending and breaking. The stuff you buy in the supermarket is junk. These are made to last a lifetime. Buy them, you won't be sorry!"
"I finally picked these up, and I have to admit they are everything they state to be. I used them on the grill, and for making all sorts of breakfast on a griddle. They do not disappoint. Highly recommend to anyone considering a simple solution for a variety of cooking applications."
"Grate to gift to anyone who loves to cook, last long great material"
Sturdy and easy to clean. Nice handles. For residential use may I suggest only packaging the 2 small sizes only. Thank you
"I bought this set along with a George Foreman grill as a wedding gift. I was pleased with the looks, quality and the fact the handles are wood, instead of plastic. I‚Äôm sure the recipient will be very pleased."
If you are a chef you need these spatulas because they are easy to handle.
"I like to have a selection when cooking, whether it's grilling or on the flat top. The 3 new spatulas are very good quality. Thanks and I know I will get years of use from them."
"Excellent quality, as I had hoped for. The two sharp corner utensils are definitely sharp at that. Can chop right through cooked hash browns or veggies on the flat top with ease. Super sturdy, comfortable wood handle grips. Recommend to anyone!"
Nice set.
"Great, professional spatulas"
I like the balance of these and the angles of the scooping surface work great on our griddle
Love these for use on my blackstone griddle!
Built like a tank. should last forever
I would buy again. As advertised.
These were bought for a present so I didn‚Äôt actually use them but they appear to be made from very nice quality materials. And the sizes give a nice variety. I did end up ordering a pancake turner from another manufacturer so there would be one that was more flexible since these are quite rigid.
"If you need large spatulas, these are great. Nice and heavy. Worth the money. I added an extra coat of vegetable oil to the wooden handles, something that should be done frequently, epecially if washed in a dishwasher."
They are good quality & work well.
Really pleased to receive such a great tool set. Great value with Lots of tool options for barbecue and hibachi.  The tools are made of top-quality stainless steel. Very sturdy and easy to clean. Definitely a recommended product.
Perfect for the black stone. Everything you need and a convenient place to store it all!
It is the perfect starter kit for my blackstone. Love everything that it came with.
We love outdoor cooking. We like to invite our neighbors to join us. The Blackstone grill and its accessories make food prep easy and also our cleanup. Looking forward to some awesome get togethers.
I love my set of tools for my Blackstone griddle. You will too.
Very useful for our Blackstone grill and camping. Easy to clean.
The bottles are a lot smaller than the picture but other than that it seems to be a nice set
Everything you need to do the job at a great price.
I got it for my brother he loves it comes with a carrying case great buy
"Wow, so many accessories for so little money. We have only had a chance to use some of them, but they work and clean just fine. Pretty good deal."
Amazing set for my grill!! Yes!
Not worth the money. Very thin glass. I definitely wouldnt try cooking with this.
"Hubby approved!! Great value, great craftsmanship"
"Very durable, all the utensils you need"
Fit perfectly on our black stone rack. Good purchase
Very nice all in one BBQ set. I can use these on my both of flat grill and BBQ grill also price and quality are worth it.
Great price for all you get
Had everything I need and high quality.Great buy!
I usually don't write reviews. But after receiving this griddle set I couldn't wait to test it out. To speak the least it didn't disappoint. Walnut banna pancakes were freaking awesome I'm a flipping griddle master. Do yourself a favor and buy this set you won't be disappointed!!!
Zipper totn loose from the bag before using
Zipper broke first time used carry case.
"Was extremely disappointed in the packaging, it was damaged and torn, taped to hold together. All the pieces were fine and none were damaged. The case to hold all of the tools in was already torn. Not impressed at all with this company's quality when it comes to packaging. We will see how the products hold up."
Baja calidad
Same as above.
Perfect for any griddle
I wish the bag was bigger to store all utensils cannot fit them and zipper up!!
"Trash product. Whatever steel they used doesn't spring back when you put any pressure on it. The material bends and stays deformed. Some of the items work fine, but at least 30% of the products in this kit are worthless. I'm replacing at least four items in this kit with products that don't suck. And those are four of the most used items. Cheap product."
"Looks good until you use them. Just buy the blackstone brand, don‚Äôt waste your time or money."
Plenty of accessories in this product. But the case to hold them in is HORRIBLE! The elastic bands aren‚Äôt Igor enough to hold them down. You close the case and everything goes all over the place. Not worth the money. Very dissatisfied. Spend a little extra and get something better.
Very sturdy. Great value
This set is perfect for on the go grilling. I would buy again
Bought for a gift. Looked nice
You get what you pay for no the best in the market but will do it‚Äôs job just fine.
"Wow! This kit comes with everything you need for a BBQ! It‚Äôs packed in a carrying case ! Perfect for camping or park, it even has a sauce container! The tools are great quality very nice material! Have use it last weekend and the utensil are super easy to clean. Highly recommend this !"
"Fast shipping. Just open the kit today. Going to have a housewarming party at this weekend. So I ordered this set for my outside barbecue dinner party. It‚Äôs a very nice griddle accessories kit set with good quality. Comes with so many different kind of prices just meet all various needs. Compared to other brands , this is the best choice. It worth every penny."
Good price and great product üëç
"I bought one setting was another brand, off Amazon for our home, then this one for our church. We like this one more! Sturdy and easy to work with, so many items in this set."
"This is a quality set of tools for the griddle. Love the size of the burger flipper, and all the items are good quality. Save yourself from gambling on other online items. You get what you pay for with these. This includes all the tools you need, especially great for someone new to griddling."
KUFUNG Stainless Steel Handle Silicone nonstick spatula is an awesome addition to my new ceramic electric skillet. I love it.
"I have been looking for something like this for a long time. The size is just right, it‚Äôs easy to stir and the food doesn‚Äôt stick to it. I love it so much that I bought 2 more, one for my daughter and one for future use."
Five stars on all accounts. Definitely recommend and will buy again.
I was doubtful that this was truly non stick but I was so wrong. This is amazing!
Was looking for reasonably priced silicone replacement for very old nylon one I managed to melt. Like it so we‚Äôll have ordered two more utensils in the same brand.
"I have tried numerous spatulas they were flimsy, finally this one is sturdy, no bending especially when trying to flip an egg!!"
"I use to flip my fish and chicken in pan, works well, then i put in dishwasher, happy with purchase!"
It works great for my air fryer
Won‚Äôt scratch new non stick pan.
I was pleasantly surprised by the weight and studiness of this spatula.
Eggs haven‚Äôt stuck yet.
Perfect for frying eggs and turning them over. Long handle very handy too!
Easy clean up with no staining from red chile from New Mexico.
These are well built and get the job done. Perfect for making bacon and eggs in the morning. Satisfied with purchase and would buy again.
Must be the Rolex of flipper floppers works like a dream
Easy to clean. Seems durable.
Great tool for my new skillet
Good product quality.
Does great job for a little money
Heat and chip-resistant-so far so good!
"Sturdy and nice, better than expected for this price."
I have a picky son with kitchen utensils and he finally loves something I purchased. I LOVE this tool!
Just what I was looking for.
Mice looking spatula
right size
I tend to burn spatulas up when I use the plastic kind and silicone spatulas are often too thick to get under an overeasy egg.This spatula checks all the boxes.
Easy to clean
Easy to clean
Took a chance without reviews and I'm pleasantly surprised...its exactly as the add describes. Eggs don't stick...its firm enough to flip omelettes and hash brown too. I like it so much that I am buying a second one. My kids love to make breakfast and leave me their dirty dishes...the non stick feature saves me aggrevation since I am doing dishes that aren't mine. I'm a happy with it and my kids like it too bc the handle isn't too short...so no worries about accidental burns. Buy it...its worth the money.
"Heat resistance, easy to use"
Works as expected.
"PROS: This spatula is flexible rather than firm (other than the metal part) and I like the soft feel. Most importantly, it‚Äôs easy to clean by hand and doesn‚Äôt melt in boiling oil at all, which is better than my previous spatula.  CON: It‚Äôs a bit small. I have no trouble flipping fish fillets or pancakes because they are large, single pieces and the spatula easily slides underneath them. However, when I have many small items to flip, like thin potato fries on a baking sheet, then it‚Äôs a hassle because it takes a while to flip all of them with the small spatula.  CONCLUSION: This is a good product and I would buy a larger version of it again."
"Nice spatula, metal covered with silicone that has sharp edges. A problem occurred with a similar spatula, as I expect may happen with this spatula, which is that excessive edge pressure will break the thin, but strong, silicone layer at the internal metal edge, and the metal will come through. Thus, the spatula should be used accordingly."
"I was looking for a 2.5"" wide spatula for a specific reason. This was advertised as 2.57"". It's not, it's actually much closer to 3"" which for me was a too wide for my need. Still, it's a good product."
Too large to be useful; the big rubber handle prevented it from going into my utensil pot; the operative part of the spatula was too thick and rubbery to pick up even a pancake cleanly. I wound up tossing it out.
It was not as described. It showed to be easy to bend and it is not. Would not order again
"I buy silicone on ceramic to keep flip eggs without sticking, and I like it so much I seldom use anything else for other foods as well. I wish they were more easily available, but glad that Amazon carries them."
"This is a sturdy product that works as expected, however, it doesn‚Äôt stay looking new for very long. The black of the silicone faded significantly from the first wash. I am not convinced it‚Äôs dishwasher-compatible, and that‚Äôs a big downside in convenience for me."
"I've been looking for a good Silicone nonstick spatulas and I've finally found one. What more can I say, it's well made, does the job and is easy to clean, it's a keeper!"
"The spatula has a nice long handle and is both sturdy enough and thin enough to lift meat or fish with ease. Silicone does not melt at normal cooking temperatures, another plus. But I do wish it were perforated to drain grease from the bottom of the cooked food."
This spatial has a nice long head & handle..I haven‚Äôt burnt my fingers flipping pancakes and for cookies it really easy to get them off the sheet..
Used maybe ten times. Right size and sturdiness to flip egg without breaking yolk; tapered leading edge slides right under veggie burger and large enough to support whole veggie burger so no crumbled patty when flipping. Only thing don't like is how extraordinarily long handle. Why so long?
"This is peace of junk. Came out of dishwasher covered in some white residue, so I washed it again by hands. When it dried up - same residue appeared again... and again.. I don't know what this spatula was made of, but wont be using it."
Only spatula I used due to holding up with cast iron and not scratching or melting from heat
"I just love this spatula. :)  Great quality, and just as described. I recommend."
"Started off great, but then one of the corners got hot and it started to fall off and left a black powder like substance on everything. It happened just after I could return it and I threw it out before I could take a picture of it. I really liked it to start, but then it went downhill from there."
"Unbranded. However, works well and is inexpensive."
This spatula is ok. It ultimately is not a great spatula.
"For the price, I expected a heavier spatula. Sometimes, you don't always get what you pay for. Still going to use it though."
So much nicer than my half melted spatula. Would buy again.
Very sturdy and easy to clean.
"Slightly smaller flipper than normal, just what I was looking for. Very sturdy, should stand up well."
I love how sturdy this spatula is - not bendable and flimsy like too many.
"Sturdy, easy to handle, and great for flipping pancakes."
It is quite resistant to high temperatures while cooking and has helped me with many dishes and preparations.
"Muy buen producto y muy buena calidad,buen precio"
Worls as advertised
"Ergonomic. Thin edge. Looks nice. Haven't used a lot, but I'm not expecting problems."
and it fits in the draw!
"Finally I found these, perfect and easy to use. Great quality as well."
"Sturdy with just enough flexibility. Made well, happy with purchase."
its a good stury spatula
"Sturdy, functional and sails through the dishwasher. Had to off gas for awhile."
Very good quality nice spatula all my kitchen utensils are this lime green just love the color
It's very sturdy and very easy to clean
I was quite impressed with the heft of this spatula; it's really solid and has some weight to it. Love it!
Handle is not flat like I thought. I can live with it Of course I have not tried pancakes yet on my small griddle to see if the handle matters. Other than that it works as expected
"Easy to clean, pretty, and it is very sturdy"
Works Real Great !!!
I feel like it‚Äôs a bit silly to write a review for this bc it‚Äôs a spatula but I honestly love it! I got the red one and it‚Äôs so easy to clean and has held up well.
"These are thicker where the handle inserts, seem to be better quality than most of the cheap silicone spatula/turners I've seen or purchased. I have another, where you can see that the handle is very near the surface of the spatula. I expect that won't last too long. These look like they will hold up."
Very happy with the quality and design. They worked even better than I had hoped for.
"These spatulas are good quality and work perfectly, making your cooking a lot easier."
So far these spatulas are holding up very well. I have used the larger one every day since I received them about a week ago.. Every other one I have purchased have always started fraying at the tips after about 3 uses even though they said they were rated to 600 degrees. I tried the cheap and more expensive models ($14.00) for one and they all failed. Only time will tell on this set.. So far these have been holding up very well.
These are the highest quality spatulas I have been able to find. They look great and are easy and comfortable to hold. They work well with non-stick pans. Turning pancakes and eggs and making stir fry is easy with these. I like the fact they came in the 2 sizes - regular and small.
"I finally got rid of my 25 year old pans (laughing) and bought my husband (no laughing) new Scan Pans which could last another 25 years. They are expensive. To make sure I don‚Äôt scratch them, I bought new spatulas. These are very strong."
"These have a wonderful design and solid construction, and just the right amount of flex in the handles. My initial thoughts was it was too short, but turns out that all my other spatulas were just a little too long!"
"These cooking utensils are not flimsy and cheaply made. There are some I've had that I use a couple of times, then have to dispose of. I expect these to be in my kitchen a good long time!"
"These 2 spatulas are just what I wanted. They seem sturdy, heat-resistant and have the perfect edge for scooping up pancakes or whatever I want to slide from the pan onto the plate. I like that the handle flexes without being wobbly. Perfect for me!"
Just what I was looking for. Strong enough to turn anything and still safe on my cookware.
These things are great. Rigid to get up under what you are cooking and supple enough to not scratch the pan. Great!
I bought these because they can resist up to 600 degrees of heat! Good product!!
Bought for cooking my morning eggs. Works fine cleans easily
Only had them for about a month but we like them so far.
"I‚Äôve only used a handful of times, but it holds up quite well during cooking and in the dishwasher!"
Very great resistant and easy to clean.
Exactly as described and was what I wanted!
Great for turning eggs or flipping pancakes.
exceeded my expectations
Really good quality products.
These tools work great on my no scratch pans.
Great spatulas at a great price.
easy to use
Work as expected. No problems.
Got these because the spatulas that I had previously just weren't up to the job. Everything stuck to them.
Love them.
Ordered 5 different spatulas from different manufactures. Wife says that the larger of the two in the package is her new absolute favorite. Looking at purchasing a second for a backup.
This product worked as expected and would buy again if needed.
"So far so good after a few weeks. Sturdy, no metal break through."
These are the best very sturdy.
"Very sturdy, easy to clean! Great buy"
Best utensils in my kitchen
"Not exactly what I wanted, but I like it easy to use and a good size. I like the smaller size."
Great product
Great thanks again
Great product
N/a
Anything
Very sturdy & strong
Good quality
The smaller spatula keeps dishwasher marks while the larger one comes out like new. They are heavier than some flimsy ones. Good firm grip. I definitely would purchase these again.
I bought this for my husband and he likes him a lot they‚Äôre easy for him to use and he‚Äôs not afraid of burning them.
I love this makes cooking delightful
I haven‚Äôt used It enough to give an accurate opinion but It Is the right size and they are sturdy
Small spots where silicone has worn away within 2 weeks of use! And I've only used it for flipping eggs.
"These spatulas are kind of thick so its hard to get precise motions, and oil likes to stick to them. They‚Äôre also kind of short but overall they‚Äôre ok."
"Good product, but I was expecting a longer lifespan."
What do you need a book?
Both the photo and the description show 2 different sized spatulas. What I received were 2 spatulas of exactly the same size. Totally identical. Why would I want that? Merchant substituted product for what was actually described and shown. Now I have to go to the department store during this pandemic to return it. THANKS Bankky!
"After they are washed, they are discolored. They look terrible. They have a white color to them."
These work great. I can use in a pan on the stove top when making pancakes or turning food that just came out of the oven!
"These are essential in the kitchens of today IF you use non stick pans. Your pans will last ten times longer, if you exclusively us silicone tools. I don't care what the manufacturer claims. Metal tools destroy non-stick surfaces. Use ONLY wood, or Silicone."
These are great to use and the variety of the sizes make them versatile for different cooking needs.
"Size and thickness are about right for ease of use for flipping everything from pancakes to eggs, works very well."
I use these everyday they are awesome no scratching my griddle and are very easy to clean
Works great. Won't scratch my pans.
Cleaning an ease!!
Very nice
Needed these!
Sturdy and good material
This is a sturdy well made tool ! I urge you to get one if you need it !!
This is a useful set that works as intended. And the price is right.
I bought these silicone spatulas to use in my air fryer. They are exactly what is shown in the ad and I use them often. I am very happy with these spatulas.
"I love these because they are sturdy and can slide under eggs, pancakes and other things without the spatula bending and messing everything up‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Durable and perfect for my cast iron skillets.
"These spatulas are longer and wider than those found in our local stores. I especially like the offset angle and the smaller spatula's beveled edges. Sure makes it easy to get that first brownie or piece of cake out of the pan! We've discovered that these spatulas can handle the extra heat on the grill plates. They have a semi-smoothe surface which keeps food from easily sliding off. We wash ours by hand, but they can go in the dishwasher."
"We live in a warm weather state and cook on the grill all of the time. I have to admit that when I opened this package I was disappointed, however, once I used them I realized just how good these spatulas were. They are sturdy enough to flip a fairly large steak."
We are very pleased with this set. Exactly what we wanted.
"I purchased these spatulas to use on my cast iron griddle. They are perfect! Well made and heavy duty. They weren't kidding when they said ""professional"". I will use these on my gas grill also. No need to worry about these falling apart. I found the price to be very good for these two spatulas. I will recommend them for sure!"
"Fast delivery came when expected. These spatulas are quality made. The small one serves a duel purpose, it's a spatula and scraper. I used them 5 minutes after they were delivered. Thank Anmarko. I will look for your items by name. I hope that you put more grilling items out."
"Well, I'm not a professional Chef, but I am the proud owned of a new Genesis II Weber Grill. . And I'm the new owner of a ""flat top"" or Plancha."" grate for it. So these tools look just like I've seen professional chefs use on TV and in every restaurant I've been to. Haven't used them yet, but I'm sure these solidly made tools will work just like I expect. The only problem may turn out to be between the handle and the grill...me :)"
"I only received one when it clearly states two. The Amazon robot took my complaint and filed it in the we dont care folder. The quality is great on what I got; just wish the other one came with it. Update, the company contacted me immediately and agreed to send me a replacement one. THANK YOU again. I strongly recommend this."
"If you're making smashburgers, this set is essential. The flipper is the perfect size for pressing down on the patties and the scrapper has a great edge to loosen them up on the flat-top right before flipping."
Way better than the older versions. This is my 2nd pair and I‚Äôve given them as gifts with great feedback. Highly recommend.
"I bought this set specifically because I needed a long spatula to replace one which had broken. When this set first arrived, I was disappointed that the new spatula was so long and it was narrower than the old one. But I have found that it is very good for things the old one wasn't so I am quite pleased with it. The smaller one is great - it makes a terrific lasagna cutter."
"I purchased this set because I wanted a long spatula for making Steak & Cheese sandwiches on the griddle. The long spatula is just perfect for that task. These are both sturdy, high quality kitchen tools. I was very happy with this purchase."
The handles do feel a little cheap when I first got them but after using them awhile they have held up well and one of the few that have the hole in them so to hang. The scrapper works alright but rather use my other one I have. I use the small one more for a small spatula and less a scrapper though it can do the job if needed.
Comfortable handle attached to a nice heavy piece of steel. Smaller one has sharpened edges. Good value.
"Excellent set of spatulas, every bit the ""Professional"" set as described. The handles are solid vinyl, so may not withstand sitting on the side of the pan directly but the metal portion of the spatulas is solid and beveled on the edges, making it easier to scoop underneath whatever it is you're cooking up. I just used the shorter one tonight on fish and it was better than using my old wok spatula. These are both quite long and wider than it might appear in the pictures, so you won't find them wanting in any way unless you're looking for an actual shovel. Highly recommended!"
"I love both spatulas, the hamburger spatula with a sharp edge for scraping is excellent and it fits right in your hand perfectly, as well as what I call the pancake spatula, long and easy to flip pancakes my wife loves them too. I am so glad I found this on Amazon. I highly recommend these. Alexander Tays"
"These are fantastic. The sizes are great and they are heavy duty enough to lift out a large serving of lasagna, for example, without any spilling over the edges. Also great on my indoor grill. I couldn't be more pleased."
"These seem to be very high quality and were great for making ""Smash Burgers"". We will see how they hold up to use."
"I sought a long-bladed pancake turner to replace one I'd owned for many years but whose handle broke. I found the one I purchased but could only purchase it as part of a set of two different sized spatulas, only one of which I actually needed. Further searching on other sites turned up a single such pancake turner but at the cost of the two spatula set. I chose to get the set because I'd be getting the one I originally wanted and another which I might find a use for in the future. I like both. The s/h was free. The package came when I was told it would. It was a good deal."
"I purchased this set for use with a new griddle on my grill. Wow, what a difference these made over the grill spatulas and other tools I had tried before. The turner is is quite strong, with just a little bit of flex. The long shape of the turner allows me to turn several items at once (slider/burger patties, sliced vegetables, toasted rolls, shrimp, you name it!). It is also really nice for flipping long fish fillets. The scraper is thicker, quite stiff, with beveled edges - great for scraping the griddle after use, but also useful chopping things while cooking, or ""helping"" the long turner flip things over. . I find I am now using this set in other cooking - ""regular"" grilling, flipping items I am broiling in the oven, etc... The construction is excellent. Very comfortable grips. All that, and they are dishwasher safe! I am very happy with my purchase. Very useful set, great construction, and a wonderful price. I highly recommend them."
I love the large size. Excellent to turn and lift larger pieces s was hen cooking.
This is a simply and hygienically built pair of spatulas. The stainless has plenty of thickness to it giving it strength and very little (if any) flexibility. The edges are also well sharpened (for a spatula) so they will cut through some stuff well without having a fine edge to get chipped or dented.
"I love these so much, they are great to cook with. Ive had mine for a while now and tjey look brand new after so many uses. They are easy to cook with."
"The long spatula is great, but the shorter one got rust spots after first use/wash."
Great for top grillwork and making cheesesteak sandwiches. Handy for keeping the food in place before placing it on bread or serving on plates.
We needed to replace our wooden handled spatulas as they were non-compliant in our commercial kitchen. These arrived in three days thru Prime. They are of a good weight and are getting the job done. Dishwasher safe is a plus. Our cook is well seasoned (get it? lol) and found them to be of good value.
"Good items. Durable. Even the weirdly long one seems to work well. The square one is very sharp and strong which is good for scraping things. A little sharp at the corners which scratches through the seasoning on my cast iron pan if you are not careful. All in all, useful."
I love to cook on a cast iron griddle. These are pretty much the perfect tools for what I do. The scraper makes quick clean up on my griddle and the size of the long spatula make plate size pancakes a reality. These are really good quality for a more than reasonable price.
"Good product, appear to be sturdy and well constructed.  It is also handy to have one tool you can use as a spatula plus being a grille/griddle scraper!"
Sturdy and easy to use.
These are substantial kitchen tools! I purchased this to replace a Pampered Chef Metal Spatula and I can say the quality seems just as good. Best part I got both tools for less than what it would cost for me to order a new PC one!
"I worked in restaurants for over 20 years and I just can't cook with ""houseperson"" tools. I need something sturdy and well made like these. Feel good in the hand."
"These are the best spatulas I've ever owned. They are thin with a tapered edge, which makes them perfect for grilling and baking. I actually bought three more because they are so useful."
"I bought these for my husbands new flat-top grill. He LOVES them, and watching him try to spin them around like a hibachi chef was worth every penny spent üòÜ! They look and feel very nice... not flimsy or cheap."
Just what I wanted
I wanted a spatula with a long surface. This set includes that plus a standard length plus a chopper/scraper. All very sturdy and the same quality as you find professionals using at restaurant grills.
"Easy to handle, durable and a snap to clean! Love them."
I purchased this set for my husbands birthday. He loves them! He was well overdue for some nice grilling utensils and use for cooking in his cast iron pan. They are very well made but light as a feather.
This spatulas were heavier duty than I expected and work great with my Blackstone Adventure grill.
"I used to be a fry cook and I can tell you that I appreciate a good set of long spatulas. These work great, of good construction, have holes, and are the perfect size for camping. No so small thst they are useless, but not so large they are unwieldy."
This long metal spatula works well as a painting tool for me. Picture using it as a really large pallet knife! The shorter one will probably be used in the kitchen.
"Very sturdy, nice sharp edge. Perfect for flipping anything from burgers to over medium eggs on my Blackstone griddle."
"My husband bought himself a hibachi grill. These are perfect for him to show out his skills to everyone making fried rice, flipping burgers and is willing to cook more often. Makes me really happy."
"I use cast iron a lot in my cooking, and these spatulas are spectacular together with the iron. Very sturdy, great construction... I anticipate years of use."
Nice tool
Was needing a longer spatula for grilling and using the outside griddle. This set is great. My husband and I like to cook with good quality utensils.
I am so impressed with the quality of this set of spatula's. Perfect for use with cast iron skillet and stainless steel skillet for turning fish or heavy items!
Works great and sturdy
"Nice, wide, & long"
This set is very well made and very sturdy. Works great on my outside flattop cooktop. Great price too. I highly recommend.
"They are great for flipping foods, pancakes especially."
They are good quality. Nice weight in the hands.
My wife bakes cakes for special occasions and wanted something to help here move a cake from the icing pedestal to the cake box. The large Anmarko metal spatula is perfect for that. She loves it. It's large and sturdy enough to move a good-sized cake.
These are of excellent quality. Look no further.
Looks professional grade. Great accessory for flat-top cooking.
"Great product, very heavly built, should last a long time"
I just got these for camping this week and I love them. They are professional grade. If I remember to update after I have been using them awhile I will.
We recently installed a cooktop that has a flat top on it. These were the PERFECT tools for it ‚Äî we liked them so much that ordered a second set
My husband is the baker in the family and bought these for the annual Christmas Cookie Baking Extravaganza. He is very please with the quality of the spatulas. Definitely sturdy not flimsy....
"This product is very well made. Very sturdy, easy to clean. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend."
I bought the set just for the rounded one--it fits the bottom of our large cast iron work perfectly.
"Great for making machetes, bbq's, happy to have them@"
"Just receive this order. The quality is apparent and they will work fine with everything from grilling, pan frying, and chopping as needed (a strong, sharp edge)."
"I bought this for my husband. He loves the largest one. He uses the large one often to flip eggs, make omelets, flip hamburgers, ‚Ä¶."
"These are good spatulas that hold up to every day use. So far the metal is secure to the handles, and there's no warping nor discoloration on the metal."
"I bought these to go with my new grill top. They work perfectly. I can now flip pancakes, fish fillets and everything else so much better than before."
easy install perfect fit.
I just got these so only time will tell but both metal spatulas are solid feeling and the metal is not flimsy. I paid less than $20 for the set and have no problem suggesting them at that price.
"This is what I was looking for, expectations were met and now I'm all set to cook in my 24"" disk wok."
the handles are sturdy enough to withstand bbq use while the blades are strong and easy to clean up.
"I mean, what's there to say about a silicone spatula? It's one of my most used kitchen tools, safe for all cookware, heat resistant, and great for scooping every last bit of a sauce or batter out of a bowl, making clean-up easier and ensuring there is no waste. There's nothing not to like. They are easily my most used tool and I especially like the small ones, they are just so handy. I already have a few in other colors but over time the pastel versions tend to get discolored which is not an issue with the black ones! Great value getting 4 in a pack, I took 2 to my office and kept 2 at home."
I really enjoy using these spatulas. It did take a little bit to get use to how sturdy they are. Because they in one piece they do not bend as easy as traditional spatulas. Once you get use to them they are wonderful.
"Perfect sizes for bigger jobs and smaller tasks, great one piece construction. great to just throw in the dishwasher and replace the spatulas I had that had wooden handles that I couldn't do that with. Will definitely buy again when these wear out."
These spatulas made outstanding replacements to one's we had for years. The single piece construction is really nice- no handles popping off when you stir or scrape something thick!
Love the mini spatulas! I have 2 others (di oro and Sweese). These are in between those others- softer and thinner than di oro but sturdier than Sweese. I usually use these to scrap the bowl clean and they work very well. Haven‚Äôt cooked with them yet. Very affordable too!
I bought two sets one for my sister and one for me and we use them every day. We are both cooks and these fit into our arsenal of must have cooking utensils
These are great if you're looking to have clean cookware. Spatulas that have 2 separate pieces get grungy quickly. I don't want to have any hiding places for bacteria & mold. These are very pliable one-piece silicone spatulas that are comfortable and nice looking next to all my other black pieces of cookware.
"Solid, weighted, good quality tools. A bit stiff for complete batter scraping. I use them for most duties in my non-stick cookware. I hand wash them, because my dishwasher leaves mineral spots on the black."
Great value! So far so good using with hot and cold items. With them being black there is no worry that some foods might stain them (as has happened with my white spatulas)
"Love the flexibility of these spatulas. Can clean out jars, scrape sides of pan and mix cake or cookie batter with ease."
I love that they are one piece! No more tops coming off or food getting stuck in the cracks. Various sizes are great and they‚Äôre very sturdy. Easy to clean.
So durable and flexible and heat does not phase these spatulas. Also great colors that don't fade with use.
Great quality and will enjoy using them for many years.
I am pleased with this purchase and will recommend to friends.
Spatulas are great. They‚Äôre actually better than the expensive Crate & Barrel versions.
These work very well for what I need. I like the one piece construction.
I love these!! No problems using hot or cold.
"Excellent product! Washes well, sturdy, durable"
Use it on my non stick pan. Good so far!
Glad to have purchased these!
These are bright and strong and versatile! Love being able to find them easily and they‚Äôre strong and can scrape the tough stuff. Love that there are two sizes.
Happy with product.
It's one piece. So when you're using or cleaning it the spatula end doesn't come off.
They are sturdy and the two sizes are good for a wide range of uses. Good price
Just as described.
Best ever love them all
Great product
Durable and flexible. Love these!
"These spatulas are a ""Must Have"" in my kitchen! I have replaced so many of them over the years due to them melting, falling apart or breaking. I finally found a set that can handle what they're supposed to do. They're not flimsy either. I could cut a cold, hard stick of real butter in half with ease and saut√© some veggies in a Wok. I used them to spread some icing on a dozen cupcakes too! Not to mention how easy it was to wash them. Unlike this name brand spatula included in my pictures. It can't be more than 4 months old and it's already coming apart. If you're a skeptic like me and unsure, I highly recommend them. I am very happy with their versatility."
Yeah very well made. Some of the best ones that I've used in some years. Nice to get a spatula that's got a lot of umph to it when you're working them hard. I don't believe the average homeowner could go wrong with a set of these Good design and well made.
"We've had these for a few months and use them daily. I ordered the set primarily for the two larger spatulas, but I've found I actually prefer the smaller ones for my scrambled eggs every morning. They still look brand new after daily use - no stains, misshaping, or any issues in the dishwasher. Great product!"
"These things are tiny. The little ones are hardly useful. And there are only 2 sizes. Not sure why you need 2 of each size... Unless you‚Äôre doing fine cake decorating, I‚Äôd look for a larger sparula"
"The best Spatulas I own! I am obsessed with these. They are amazingly heat resistant, I have mistakenly left one of these in a wok while stir frying some veggies and it didn‚Äôt melt or was hot to the touch when I finally realized and took it out. I wish there was a whole line of other kitchen utensils like these. I wish I could give this 10 stars."
"Compre dos pares, uno para m√≠ y mi t√≠a, el m√≠o la uso para sartenes antiadherente y no se han derretido funcionan de maravilla aunque me hubiera gustado que fuesen m√°s grande, no vi las medidas lo compre pq se puede utilizar para antiadherente ya que andaba buscando algo en madera. Con mi t√≠a ella la necesitaba para resposteria."
My only complaint is the end of the smaller spatulas is floppy and i have to change my grip lower when using it. Overall they are sturdy and stiff and highly recommended for the price.
What's not to like? These are essential in any kitchen. Since they're silicone they are heat resistant so they won't warp like cheap plastic when used in hot pans. They are sturdy. And the colors are cheerful. A+
This product is more so intended for baking mixing up batter/though but it isn‚Äôt sturdy enough it is too flimsy and bendable so if you have a super thick batter you‚Äôre going to be struggling because it has no resistance it doesn‚Äôt break but it‚Äôs hard to stir because it is just flimsy the handle has nothing hard inside of it to keep it sturdy
This was a inexpensive purchase. Product holds up nicely. Haven't stressed the heat resistance to the max but not an issue for using during stovetop cooking.
They were so inexpensive that I was skeptical about the quality but decided to try them. The quality is excellent and in fact of better quality than some that cost more. They're very sturdy.
Sturdy and holds up to heat while cooking. Love the smaller ones for scraping out that last bit of peanut butter in the jar :)
Very good spatulas are very sturdy and they aren't falling apart every 5 minutes
Sturdy but scraper part gives in the right way to scrape bowls clean!
"Bright colors, sturdy and work well."
I'm not really a cook but these set of spatulas can be handy when the need arises.
"These silicone spatulas are great. The different sizes make them versatile kitchen tools. They‚Äôre heat-resistant, and won‚Äôt scratch your pans."
These are durable and the different sizes allow for versatility of use. Fun colors too!
"I like the firmness, easy to clean."
Wish I‚Äôd had these years ago. Perfect sizes for all uses! Love these!
Looks good
I love these Spatulas. They're perfect and the price was good! I've used them with high heat and they're holding up great. They havent melted or deformed at all!
Just Awesome for my treat making business..
Great set of spatulas. I have been using them for a month and have no complaints. Saw a review about spots after dishwashing and I haven't had that problem. Highly recommend.
I likes
I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
The 2 bigger ones are just the right size the 2 smaller ones probably just suit for use like a spatula but they are quite sturdy
Great!
Great kitchen tool! No worries about melting. Not flimsy.
These are really nice spatulas. Love how heat resistant and sturdy they are. Happy with my purchase!
Use them daily.
"we like the way it feels in your hands, sturdy and up to the kob"
These are great! I'm so glad I purchased them.
Love my spatulas. Perfect for every last use!
"Love my newest s addition to my kitchen! I wish the smaller ones had a little longer handle and there were more color options, but luckily they worked well with my kitchen colors!"
My new favorite kitchen tool!
"Great quality, getting another set"
"Is as described I just thought would be flatter for like turning eggs, ect. This is not negative review, I just did not look closer at what I was ordering"
I only got three not 4
"I ordered 4, I only got the two large ones. 50% is a failing grade"
"These silicone spatulas are quite nice. They're rigid, but not hard. They're not flimsy. These work well for stirring in a hot pot because they won't melt. I stirred some spaghetti sauce, that I was thawing in a pot, w/the bigger size spatula. The sauce did not stain my spatula. I used the red one just in case, but there was no sign of staining. These also work well for folding/mixing, spreading, and of course scraping a bowl clean. I used the smaller size to mix up a batch of garlic butter. I spread the garlic butter onto the bread and then scraped the excess into a container for later use. I didn't notice any lingering garlic smell either. I washed them in my dishwasher. Overall I'm quite pleased w/this set of silicone spatulas."
"These are fairly soft and very flexible, perfect for most batters and doughs. These could be a little to soft for very heavy thick mixes. The handles are nice and stiff, they flex somewhat while I am using them but I really think they are about right.  I wish this set had 3 different sizes, it really needs a medium sized spatula instead of just small and large. Instead there are 2 small and 2 large. For us, 2 of these are either going to end up being a gift or pushed to the back of a drawer.  Overall these are good quality and if you need extra's this set could be perfect, if it was 1 small, 1 medium and 2 large this set would be ideal for a lot more kitchens. But the quality easily deserves 5 stars."
Very good quality set! Strong stainless steel does not bend or warp. Brass rivited wood handles are half-tang but holds tight. Nice assortment for oudoor cooking with cast iron. Especially liked the added nice touch of the added hand chopper. It has measurement conversion tables on 1 side and linear measure on the cutting edge on the other side.
Have had this awesome Spatula set for a several of weeks now and I love them. They are a great size and a nice variety. I use them with my new Blackstone 36 inch Outdoor Flat Top Gas Grill Griddle Station and they work great! Do not put them in the dishwasher. The handles won't like it!
"These are very nice restaurant quality spatulas. They are much bigger than I expected, but I didn't read the dimensions. It was a good purchase."
Great for outdoor griddle
"When I was a high school kid in the early 70s, I worked for McDonald's. (Didn't most HS kids in those days?) So, I cut my spatula chops flipping thousands (seemed like billions) of hamburgers. Many spatulas today try to be too fancy. A single shiny piece of stainless steel with a rubber-coated handle. Ick. No thank you.  I was raised on spatulas with a nice wood handle riveted to a platen with beveled edges. Over time, the wooden develops a nice patina. It's a tool, not a piece of kitchen art.  THIS IS AN EXCEPTION SET OF SPATULAS for the utilitarian, no frills person. Great for the kitchen. Great for the BBQ. I'll probably buy several more sets ... some to give as gifts and some to safekeep so that I have a lifetime supply.  Oh, and yeah, the price is unbelievably cheap. If they're sold out, it's because I bought out the remaining supply."
Excellent product and I've already use them on my new griddle. They work great!
"We haven't had it long so can't speak to say if they hold up to no rust...but we love what is included in the package. The only thing I would say we are missing is the silicon egg rings for the griddle. This was the only package I saw with great reviews that had the 4"" spatula. I think it is awesome to have the versatility of sizes on the spatulas."
Love this set! Perfect for our griddle bbq!
"I own a deli we have a grill, I ordered these spatulas for it and they happen to be good quality."
"The scraper is my favorite of the set. Lightweight and good wooden handle. Glides over my grill and easily cleans off food particles. The spatulas are a good size. I grill a lot of vegetables and steaks, so each has a niche of its own."
"These are my ""go to"" kitchen utensils. Sturdy, hi-quality. Love love love the large spatula which doubles as a scraper on my cast iron baking pans and large skillets. The edges are so thin they're almost sharp - great for flipping pancakes and getting under those large chicken. Great wooden handles. I take good care of these tools and wash them by hand."
Have used frequently for over a month. Really like the overall sturdiness. Had originally purchased different brand with plastic handles. Returned because thin metal flexed and plastic handles looked like they would break sooner rather than later. Appears to be good value for price.
There isn‚Äôt anything I did not like about this product it works very well I have my granddaughter making pancakes with them she had no problems using them at all they cleaned up very nicely thank you
"I used these for the first time this past weekend and have no complaints at all. Only time will tell on how long they last, but I feel confident they will hold up just fine."
"I was able to use all of these tools shortly after receiving the shipment. Easily went under steaks and burgers. Was able to cut, control during lift and turning over. Slid off when tilted and stayed centered when lifted even at a slight angle. I really like this set? Easy to clean and hang with knives and spoons."
Unfortunatelyy dad never saw his father's day gifts cause he passed away. I used it tho and it works well. Thank you
These spatulas are more than just good looking the are well balanced and a nice weight. They were just what I needed for my outside grilling. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good set of spatulas.
"I purchased a griddle several months ago and I wanted tools that would help me with cooking. I ordered the spatulas with the griddle and found that they exceeded my expectations. I am considering to purchase them again just so I have sufficient tools when I need them. Great buy, I would reco9mmend them to everyone."
Really like these they are sturdy with wood handles actually have some weight to them NOT flimsy like some other spatulas
Spatulas are very strong and sturdy plus you get lots of extra goodies like the sauce bottles good value
This set is awesome! I smoke meat and bbq a lot. The long spatulas come in handy for chicken breast in smoker. I also use them on my iron skillets. The price is unbelievable for what you get!
So far so good!!! We get these reviews so close to the date of purchase. We need more time with the product. But like I said in the short amount of time I‚Äôve had these spatulas they seem to be fine. I‚Äôm using them for my griddle.
"As a master home cook, these have amazing uses!! You can scrape your cast iron pan when saut√©ing say garlic to get all those delicious flavors!! I also use the big one on the gasgrill"
"They are really great and I think a must have for frequent cast iron pan users! We haven't tried them on the grill yet, but I think these spatulas should make turning and flipping food very easy. I can't believe it took me that long to try them out! Great variety of sizes, too!"
They work the way they are supposed to. They are sturdy and do not bend while using. They clean up very easily. The three sizes meet any of your cooking or grilling needs. Highly recommend.
They don't really have much Bend or Flex to them but they are great for making Smash Burgers.the quality is great and they are easy to clean.
Great I have a set and just bought my son a set great for out door are indoor cooking
A gift to my son-in-law he really really loved it very sturdy he like the wooden handle very sharp that was amazing
If you grill on heavy duty equipment you'll appreciate these tools.
"These are quite nice and very sturdy. Bought for camping actually, but some might end up in my home. They are a little big, but I've found it handier than I thought."
"Real commercial quality, not cheap junk. Scraper has a ruler on it"
"Seems to be a good product. There is some flex to the spatulas, which is good, but sturdy enough to do good smash burgers."
"Well-made products. Had purchased one before and decided I wanted another large one to match what I had. My neighbor liked it as well, so I bought this set to split with him."
Multi purpose grill use.
This is great product everything we needed for our new flat iron grill I am happy with my purchase
"This product is sturdy, well made, and easy to use."
This is a great combination pack that had everything I needed for making everything from omelette to delicate fish filets. It‚Äôs sturdy enough to smash ground beef for smash burgers. Good buy.
"Great product, great price."
Good quality product
Bought these for my black stone and love them
Love this product
"Excellent for the smash burgers my son cooked for us, the blades are wide and heavy. The blades are beveled, which helps when turning food. Nice rivets holding the handles to the blades. Overall a great product"
Love the sturdy feel.
Seems to be very sturdy and strong. Heavyweight.
"I love these Spatulas! They are great for flipping anything, so precise, over easy eggs with stainless compared to plastic, well there is no comparison. These are great to cook with, easy to clean and very attractive"
"I love this spatula set. The ends are sharp and can cut through chicken or steak. I use them on my griddle and they work great! The two bottles are great as well. I filled one with oil and the other with water for a camping trip and was worried they would leak, but they didn‚Äôt leak a drop! Great product overall"
These spatulas are sturdy and they work well for what we need. I hand wash them since they have wooden handles. We have used them 3 times and they still look and feel as good as new.
I just love the weight and comfort of these. I may need another set for my daughter so she doesn't slip mine into her purse. üòÇ
"Very Nice, more solid than I expected."
Handles on this set are very tight and feel good in your hand . Others I have are just loose so they had to go to the landfill .
There's nothing to dislike. The price great and quality is good too
Nice sharp edges on all spatulas. Appears to be well made. Can't wait to use them.
Well made! As advertised
Made my cooking for meals-on-wheels go a lot faster!
Great product!
These are a great value. I would like it if they were a little heavier but they do get the job done. Great for basic cooking needs like flipping a burger or flipping roasting vegetables. Would be a perfect set if one was a bit heavier to make smash burgers. Will have to purchase an additional one specifically for that purpose. Still a great set to own!
Looks like good quality!
I bought it for just incase spatula for my outdoor grill.......now is my wifes favorite
"Gave as a gift, was told they are great for camping and bbq."
Nice and solid!
"Very sturdy and strong construction, you will never have to worry about dropping food because of flexing."
"Not only was this an awesome gift i bought for my husband, but the shipping: wow i ordered them and then they were in my mail box the very next day!!!"
"I like the product, very sturdy. USE them all the time."
This things are nice and sturdy and I mean sturdy....very nice material ....the work great...love the different sizes you can use for a lot of different jobs...fajita for your tacos...smaller one for tortilla flipping....to scoop chopped veggies.... I really recommend them.
Good
"Great sturdy spatula set, not to be used for nonstick pans"
Good quality
I purchased this as a gift for a friend. For the cost you can‚Äôt beat it. There are other sets that cost more money but these were solid and seemed durable upon inspecting them when they first arrived. I would recommend this set for anyone looking for a cost effective and durable spatula set.
Great
Solid construction and will last me a lifetime. I like to buy items once and have no regrets. These meet those requirements. Ordered a 2nd set for lake house because there was no reason to think I can get better.
I don't write reviews often but the quality of these spatulas are amazing for the price. Extremely solid with a full tan (metal through entire handle). I don't see how it would be possible to bend the metal simply flipping food. You would have to put effort into bending these intentionally.  The only negatives I could say is the edges of the stainless steel are a bit sharp and a few parts of the wood handle were a little rough. I took a long screwdriver and rubbed the tubular part of the screwdriver's metal shaft along the cut edges of the metal and wood and smoothed out these areas so they were very comfortable to touch. It only took about 2 minutes to do both spatulas and they feel very comfortable to hold now.
Solidly built. Good quality. Great value.
Just these at work...gets a lot of use. Holding up like a champ.will purchase again.
"As described, very sturdy and reliable tools."
These are very nice and made well.
Good quality product üëçüèª
Goes with traeger
"These are the best kind of durable, short spatulas for your cast iron or SS pans, strong and well made."
These spatulas hold up amazingly well so far. They are easy to clean and have not bent or warped at all. We have them out on our grill and use them a lot.
Work well in my kitchen. Dishwasher safe. Cut well.
These are great for use with our flattop grill! Very sturdy and perfect for cooking!
These are wonderful kitchen tools. They are sturdy and very well made. We're very happy with this purchase.
Very happy with these spatulas. Does the job.
In my cast iron skillets an my grill.
Love em
Love this! Very sturdy and it cuts very easily.
especially for the price. I mostly use them on my cast iron cook top.
Great except handle is a bit loose on one of them.
"Great for deep dish pizza, easy to clean, and they‚Äôre holding up so far!"
I bout these for restaurant I work for and I love them. Easy to handle. Perfect
Good quality and strong!
"This spatula was very easy to clean, and very durable."
"Love the Spatulas itself, but I dislike that the metal in the handles get Hot."
These are wonderful spatulas!! I will buy more of them!!!
Perfect for iron skillet
"We purchased this turner along with 5 other brands of stainless steel turners at the same time. This one is by far the best design, quality, weight and feel. I personally love the handle and the thickness of the neck. This one should last a very long time. I highly recommend OXO products. In our specific situation we will be using this for construction purposes because they do not make a tool for the task we are doing. We've found these work great and they last. Hopefully this says something in terms of quality and durability of this product. A well made product deserves the extra time spent for the review. If this has helped you make a purchase decision please give me a helpful vote below."
"This turner has some poor design features. The front edge of the blade is too thick and not beveled, which negates its use as a turner. The soft handle material (black) on the underside of the handle, about 1/2 way, is not sealed to the SS properly, in that food particles, soapy water, etc. gets in between the SS and the soft black material and it is very difficult (impossible?) to get it out and get it clean. I am very disappointed in OXO and this product."
"At one of the Bay Area's upscale kitchen supply stores, I'd expect a ladle with this one's look and feel to be listed at four times the price Amazon is charging. I mean, this thing radiates quality, from its heft in your hand to the sheen of its brushed stainless steel. I'm a believer in buying the best cooking tools, because you only have to buy them once. And not only do they result in better food, they make the process of cooking a joyful one.  I have no idea how OXO can sell this ladle at this price and make money on it, but more power to them. I'll be looking at this brand when I replace some of our flimsy bargain-basement utensils, purchased with the best intentions by my penny-pinching significant other."
"This item costs double what I would pay at my local supermarket, but it is a much better product, too. Most of it is a single piece of good, solid steel. The underneath side of the handle is a black synthetic material, probably silicon, which is a little sad because I wanted a turner that Ox, the oversized beagle pup, could not destroy. He's a big boy and can reach almost anywhere on the kitchen counter and in the sink. The dishes don't always get done right after dinner, and that hound has gone through 3 good turners, which he drags into the living room and buries in his favorite quilt on the sofa to snack on later when nobody's looking. So the single-piece steel construction was what attracted me. Let that dog try to eat this one, I thought. Had I looked more carefully at the photograph--and it's true that this site is notorious for posting photos of something other than the product being sold, but in this case it's exactly correct, as of this review date--I would have seen the black material beneath, just on the handle. It does provide for a pleasanter heft, easier on the hand than if it was all steel, and it will probably suit your needs just fine. But I myself would have been even happier if it had just been one block of stainless steel and nothing else. All told, this is a great tool for a person that cooks often using cookware that doesn't have a nonstick interior, and that doesn't have a utensil-stealing pup in the house. I have other turners that I use for my nonstick pans, but this one is good for my Calphalon and Revere Ware skillets and saute pans. I would buy this turner again if it came down to it...and with Ox in the house, it may."
"I bought this almost 4yrs ago and all my other spatulas didn't make it through. This is my favorite spatula and usually my go-to for dinner time or things like pancakes. It always feels very sturdy and looks the same as when I bought it, even though it gets mostly clean in the dishwasher almost every day. It doesn't seem to hold heat like the others and if I leave it on the edge of a pan or pot I don't have melted plastic dripping or find it too hot to touch. It is on the larger side, so if I'm flipping bacon, I may reach for a smaller spatula. So I'm buying this and the one by Sam and something co. Wish OXO made one like this but smaller but without losing the same qualities found in the handle."
"I can be pretty hard on my spatulas. I use cast iron and I push down on things hard. This is not one of those cheap thin metal things you get at the dollar store, this won't bend and break on you with normal use. It's a solid piece of metal through the whole shaft. Also, the blade is a good thickness: sturdy not to break or bend, but thin enough to actually get under things. The reason I'm buying a second one is I'm going through a divorce and my wife insisted on keeping the good spatula because it's so awesome and I don't blame her! Mostly I use this for whole grain pancakes on cast iron, but it works well for meat too. I don't use anything but cast iron and steel, and obviously, you wouldn't want to use this on a non stick surface!"
"My search for a strong, stiff, durable spatula has ended. I have grown weary of short, wimpy big box types. I'm not flipping pancakes and burgers. I use it for scraping fond from the base of Dutch ovens and saut√© pans. It does that beautifully and should last a very long time. However, be warned that ridges on the underside of the handle have not been adequately de-burred. When cleaning the channel formed by these ridges one could be sliced. It was even sharp enough to cut the wash cloth. I don't MY blood in the stew. So, a little filing and sandpaper was used to solve the problem."
"i‚Äôve had lots of turners in the past years but this is The Best! I bought my first one in 2013 and never really thought about it, just used it. Until now. I went to pick it out of my utensil carousel tonight and it wasn‚Äôt there! Somehow, someone put it someplace, IDK where! Panic! My favorite spatula just wasn‚Äôt gonna handle the job! So I just made do for tonite. And ordered a magnificant replacement!  So I looked in my orders to find it. I was surprised I bought the last one in 2013! It just did not look that old!"
"Very large, longer than any of my other utensils. Sturdy. In this order I also purchased a barbeque spatula, which is only a couple of inches longer than this one. I could have used this one for both indoor and outdoor cooking."
"I purchased this about 5-years ago and it has become my favorite spoon and it‚Äôs about twice the capacity of what I would call the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù size. It‚Äôs large, heavy, well built and I have yet to be dissatisfied with any Oxo product I‚Äôve purchased. Some may not like the size but it‚Äôs handy for soups, chilies and pasta salads when you really don‚Äôt want to be dipping into something frequently and having a lot of it fall off‚Ä¶ and not much falls off of this spoon. Mine looks about as good as it did the day I received it and for about 10-bucks it was well worth the price and a real bargain for how well it‚Äôs built. It‚Äôs not the best for stirring anything because very little of the spoon end will touch the bottom of a pan but it‚Äôs a great serving utensil and you‚Äôll never have to worry about it bending."
"This was better quality than I expected. Works great! It feels very solid and does not bend. Does not feel cheap. Beautifully made. Elegant design. Was bought for cast iron pan use, having burnt my plastic spatulas... Not sure if the grippy underside of the handle is silicone. Have not left it on any hot surfaces to find out but hope that it would hold up in the heat if that accidentally occurred. Would buy again. It feels so solid that it is nice enough to give as a housewarming, bridal shower, or foodie friend gift."
"I ordered five different ""square"" spatulas, in order to find the right one - we go through a lot. Of the five, this Oxo spatula was incredibly superior to the others. The steel is about 1/16"" thick, probably 40% more than any other. It shows in the weight and rigidity of the product. The one-piece design doesn't bend when used, and the body is nice and wide, making it easy to scoop and turn things. My one concern is the plastic handle, which collects water when run through the dishwasher - and therefore could also collect debris, grease, etc. But the rest of this product is TOP NOTCH. I highly recommend it."
"I dropped this while removing it from the package and thought, ""Oh no! I've damaged it straight away!!!"" Nope. It was fine! I'm a little fussy about my turners. I don't like it when they leave stuff behind or break up my egg yolks... Fussy, I know... It's a quirk. This turner makes things a clean sweep so to say. It's an easy grip too, so that makes it even better! There's ... I think silicone or something like it ... on the back of the handle, so it doesn't slip out of my hand even if it gets wet. I have a feeling I will have this turner for a long time. :)"
"I bought this stainless steel ladle after I became informed about the dangers of using melamine, rubber, or any other petroleum-based coated type of cooking utensil which might potentially leach harmful chemicals into my family's food. God knows, with so many chemicals in our food, water, and soil these days, I didn't need any more making their way into our (mostly) organic kitchen.  Enter OXO and their top-quality line of products. This ladle is easy on the hands, pours without spillage, cleans up beautifully, and serves just the right amount. The handle is 9.25"" from base to handle tip, and its bowl has a capacity of 2/3 cup (approx 5.33 ozs). These are perfect dimensions and help gauge a proper serving size (about two ladles) for soups, stews, etc. Heck, we even use it for solid foods because it's so convenient. Highly recommended."
"I have been looking for a decent metal spatula as we use stainless steel pots and pans at our house. Due to all the non-stick items out there it is really hard to find decent metal utensils that don't cost a fortune! The metal is thick enough it won't immediately bend, it's a good size (not too big, not too small) and has a nice""heft"" to it. I think my husband is sick of hearing about how much I love it. Yes, I am a real customer and no, I didn't get this free in order to write a review. I like OXO products and was really excited to find this spatula."
"This is just what I needed for making nice crisp hash-browns in our big cast-iron skillet. I start by cooking crispy bacon in the pan, to get some flavorful grease, then saute chopped onions and add the shredded potatoes. Often the bacon would leave a sticky film on the pan that was impossible to loosen with any of our plastic spatulas. This beauty did the trick. It removed the carbon deposits from the cast iron without damaging the seasoning on the metal. That skillet has never looked better and the well-seasoned surface of the cast-iron is virtually non-stick."
"The handle on our old plastic ladle snapped in two when I was drying it, so I needed a new one. Saw this and got it because it is stainless (handle is not going to break off) and it is Oxo, a brand I trust.  No disappointments. This is a hefty piece. It is dishwasher safe. And it is very comfortable to hold with the rubber lined handle.  A pet peeve of mine is the failure of sellers to provide key information like the capacity of a ladle. This one is 4 ounces or 1/2 cup."
"Most turners that are readily available are plastic so that they do not damage non-stick cookware. The leading edge of the blade is usually too thick to easily slip under a product. While this turner cannot be used in a non-stick pan, it works very well on stainless steel or cast iron. Handle doesn't melt when left to rest on the edge of the pan although it will get hot."
"I used to be married to a professional chef, and so my kitchen utensils became much more about sturdy while also being useful. The weight on the spatula was impressive, and the slope on the front of the spatula face is perfect for getting under those foods that need flipping. It's a wide spatula with a handle built to fit in the palm of the hand. OXO is a brand I trust to buy without putting hands on the item first."
"Love this thing! Extremely sturdy and well made, don't throw it around and it should last for years. The only con might be I wish it was just a tad sharper making it easier to get under stuff, but this hasn't caused me any problems. Highly recommend!"
"I am trying to reduce the amount of plastic I use and like stainless steel. I bought the ladle, slotted spoon and spaghetti server. The quality of these are impressive and they actually look good sitting on my counter in the ceramic utensil holder. Because I have a glass top stove I have melted a few plastic things setting them down after the burners were turned off but not cool. If (when) I make that mistake again these will survive making it a good investment."
Enjoying using this so far to make eggs and such in my cast iron skillets. It's big an strong and doesn't flex much. Certainly not for dainty cooking activities. I think this should last quite a while.
We upgraded to stainless steel pots and pans and decided it was time to get some cooking utensils to go along with it. OXO has been a consistent brand in terms of quality and this spatula is no different. We were looking for a non-angled short spatula and this fits our needs. Would purchase again.
"We love this ladle. It is sturdy, looks great, and is very comfortable to hold. It is the perfect size to serve an average portion of soup with one scoop, or a large portion with two.  The design of the ladle makes it possible to easily get a full scoop even when the pot is running low because it is wider but not as deep as typical ladles. The angle of the handle is also just right for easily handling a full scoop.  The silicone side of the handle gives great traction and control while the stainless side looks very nice and gives a great presentation.  I am extremely happy with this ladle. It is made in China which is less than ideal, but is much better than the made in China quality you'd expect."
"It seems strange to me that the first word that comes to my mind for this kitchen implement is ""pretty"", especially given it's multitude of uses, it's true: I think this is one of the most attractive utensils in my little utensil crock. Beyond that, though, it really is very sturdy and about the exact right width (3"") for scooping out a single serving of lasagna or casserole ... mayyybe a little on the large side if you've got folks who like very small portions. This also came to my aid when I baked some chocolate chip cookies that turned out to be much stickier than my usual batches -- it scooted easy under those gooey middles.  It's only been through the dishwasher a handful of times (on the top rack), but so far, so good."
"I'm simply thrilled with this turner. It is gorgeous (I display it, when not using it, in my Calphalon stainless steel utensil crock), and the best quality turner I've ever owned. The brushing of the steel will help to make any scratching that occurs from usage less noticeable than if it were polished steel, but so far I haven't had a single scratch appear during usage! It is solid and durable-feeling without weighing a lot, VERY comfortable to hold and use, and thin enough to be able to easily get under anything you need to turn or scrape. I mainly use it with my Corning Ware or glass bakeware that gets too hot from oven use to use nylon utensils. I LOVE this turner! WELL WORTH the money spent!"
"If you cook on cast iron, this is the spatula for you. If you cook on those as seen on TV teflon coated lightweight pans this is NOT a good choice (and neither are those pans...).  Made of a single thick piece of stainless, it's pretty much bomb proof. It does have a rubber insert on the backside for comfort and handling but even if it came apart (which I don't see happening) it would still work fine. Being nice and thick flipper it has the power to flip heavy foods, like burgers and steaks but its edges are beveled so it also handles the lighter and more delicate stuff like eggs and such.  I doubt I can wear it out but I'd buy another if I did."
I had a previous version of this spatula that I really liked and I think this one is better. This spatula is made of a single piece of steel and feels very sturdy. The previous one had a separate handle and flipper part spot welded together and the welds eventually failed after 10 years. I expect this one will last at least 20 years of daily use.  It works great with all my cast iron and stainless (not non-stick) pans.
"I like that there are no nooks and crannies for food to settle in, so cleaning is a breeze. Works well on flipping everything from omelets to burgers."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this bbq tool. It is sturdy, easy to handle, easy to clean, and does a great job with turning food on the bbq. For us the size is perfect. It allows easy reach to the back of the bbq without losing arm or hand hair in the process. I highly recommend it, especially because the size makes turning things so easy. Reasonable price."
"Elegant and useful, and very attractive. It's oxo but even better. A definite improvement, leads and bounds nicer than the hard plastic."
"This is a heavy duty spatula excellent for burgers, pancakes etc, but not good for delicate cookies or ""over easy"" eggs. There is no flexibility and the blade is thick and doesn't taper at the edge making it very clumsy for light weight flipping."
"Look, no spatula is likely to change your life. The big thing I wanted from this was to be a more or less ""normal"" spatula size and shape, but be able to handle scraping tough, really cooked-on food on the bottom of a full pot of stew, jambalaya, etc. effectively, and without bending. This does that, so I'm happy with it."
"Attractive, high-quality and heavy-duty but not ""too heavy"" in your hand ... and attractive. Nice brushed look. And the ladle holds exactly 1/2 cup! Great for dieters and diabetics who measure their food quantity! Has a 9-inch handle and ""plays well with other"" utensils. (Mine are in a crock and this does not sit above or below my others.) I'm planning to buy more as gifts!!"
This device is not for a person with a small hand. It is big and not handy. But it is very sturdy and scrapes a frying pan with ease.
"I bought this for grilling out, and so far it's worked really well. The handle has a good grip. It's easy to clean. Seems to hold up well against the heat of the grill. I really like OXO brand products, and this is no exception."
"I needed a spatula to really scrape pan drippings in my cast iron skillet. The silicone ones made for non-stick cookware are too flimsy. This one is rugged and would be good for outdoor grills, too. I've found OXO products to always be consistently well made."
"GIFT FOR MY SON, HE LOVED IT. WELL DESIGNED WELL MADE & THE PERFECT ADDITIONS TO HIS KITCHEN NOW I NEED ONE FOR MINE."
"My previous spatula was flimsy, but this one is sturdy and works well. The thickness of it causes me to believe it will last longer than previous spatulas I've purchased. I have zero complaints about this product."
"Sturdy and perfect alternative to plastic spatulas. I'm not sure if it's scratching off some of my cast iron seasoning, though. It's thin enough to get under eggs and fish if they're not sticking to the pan at all. A flexible spatula might be better a little better for those."
"Product works as expected with some added benefits.  The missus was saying that we needed one of these when we make soups, stews, or hot chocolate and I bought this OXO one as I've heard good reviews about their products. I must say that this ladle has a nice weight to it that feels sturdy but not laden at the same time. We love the fact that there is a rubber under guard so you can rest it on the pot while cooking so the handle doesn't get hot. We've used this for a few months now and so far it looks to be very durable. I would not hesitate to buy another OXO product again. (note they are a bit more pricier than some of their competition)"
OXO Good Grips Brushed Stainless Steel Ladle and 2 other items purchased. The best way to say it is anything OXO is well thought out and manufactured with quality in mind at a fair price. OXO makes great products.
"Me gusta mucho, no se me ha oxidado, ya tengo tiempo con el y solo tiene algunos rasgu√±os de ah√≠ en m√°s esta perfecto! üíØüíØ"
"Solid spatula, fits the hand well and stiff. Made out of one piece of steel, with a filled area at the top for better comfort when holding it. Square ended with rounded corners, I use this for scraping the fond out of my cast iron skillet when cleaning it (Never wash them with soap, just get them good and hot and put in some hot water, and scrape while it bubbles) with no trouble.  OXO Good Grips stuff routinely wins on America's Test Kitchen testing, so it's pretty much always a good buy."
Oxo good grips are extremely well made and excellent quality! I have the wooden spoon collection and decided to get this for my cast iron skillets and it‚Äôs perfect!! Will last a lifetime!!
"No knobs, nooks, holes, or crannies to fight to get it clean. No worries of plastic melting if I accidently sit it on the stove. Does the job and still looks great. Goes right in DW and comes out sparkling. Well made and does not look cheap. Doesn't bend - feels sturdy in your hand. I'd buy it again."
"We've gone through a lot of spatulas. This one is holding up well. We haven't had any trouble at all flipping eggs. I hope it keeps on holding up, but so far so good.  It's not solid, as it appears. The underside of the handle is hollow, with a piece fitted into the underside. (I think that part is plastic--I'm not the one who uses it most--and that's probably so you don't burn your hand on it. It's lighter and a little flimsier than we'd hoped, but performing far above what any other spatula has for us."
"One of the nicest, well-made spatulas I've ever had. Should last for many years. Thin enough to get underneath a fired egg without breaking the yolk."
This thing weights like 5 lbs of solid steel at least. Do you expect less from OXO. They make the best kitchen crap for the worst home cooks in the world. At least you're giving it the college try to make a decent meal by purchasing quality kitchen staples.
"Great product, light, easy to grip and use. I recommend this for any application, be careful with non-stick pans, any metal item."
I used this for fish it helped drain it and I was able to get the skin off using this. Very comfortable in the hand & durable.
"Be conscious to make sure to let it dry vertical with the handle facing up, to make sure no water gets trapped."
"Good product. We were travelling and needed a (flipper) turner that would work for a conventional skillet, not one made of plastic. This one is very sturdy."
"I have used this item for over four months now and it has a comfortable handle and is sturdy and looks nice. The bottom side of the handle has a black colored material which makes the handle rounded and comfortable to hold. It is light enough to use comfortably yet heavy enough that you feel you got a well made item. It appears thin as it should for getting under food to flip it, but is strong and is likely to hold up well to long term use. I would recommend this product."
"Was looking to replace our plastic kitchen utensils and cookware with safer stainless steel. Really tried to buy mad in the usa products but struck out with finding utensils. Besides being manufactured elsewhere, this fits the need well. Its sturdy and looks nice."
"Generous scoop portion, wide form makes for easy-pour and can be used for stews, noodles, etc as well as soups. Easy clean, easy hold, very sturdy."
OXO easily out competes other metal spatulas at half the price. This is a good company.
"Since my child accidentally tossed my old plastic ladle across the kitchen, thereby rendering it broken and useless, apparently in an attempt to help me rid my kitchen of even more unhealthy plastic utensils, I ordered this stainless steel ladle as a replacement.  I find the handle to be comfortable without being too bulky and the scoop to be quite large, enough to handle even large matzo balls.  It's also pretty to look at, as it sits in an open wooden utensil holder on my counter."
The flat edge works great in the cast iron fry pan! It is sturdy enough to flip it over and scrape the pan when needed with out bending the handle.
"No more rust stains! The handle stays cool with the help of the guard on the underside of the handle. It's dishwasher safe and very easy to clean. No more plastic or non-stick coatings that wear off! For once, let your utensil drawer look classy with stainless steel that does not break the pocketbook. I would not recommend this for pots that have non-stick coatings because this could scratch it if used too vigorously. I have a favorite cast iron skillet that is unfazed by my energetic use of the spatula."
"Feels good in the hand, very sturdy and big. Husband loves it. I use it for eggs and pancakes."
I use in kitchen all the time it is a solid flipper with little to no give to it. If that works for you then get it you well really like it.
"This turner is huge. Very hefty. It's nice, easily cleaned, and incredibly sturdy. Because of its size, it would almost be at home on an outdoor grill. It should last years and years, but be aware that it is super-sized! If you have smaller hands or are petite it could be fatiguing to hold for long."
"Nice ladle, I have a lot of oxo kitchen utensils/gadgets. They are all do what they are supposed to do. I have no complaints. I like it when you buy something for a purpose and it just works. Thank you oxo"
Purchased to use on outdoor grill. Well made and easy to clean. Not too heavy and flips burgers A+
Solid spatula with stainless blade that goes into the dishwasher
"Great product, easy fit easy to clean"
"I love all of the OXO products that I have purchased, and the list is getting long. And, yes, I like this Spatula!! To be honest, the first one I got had a problem with the rubber side, where my fingers go. I contacted the company, and they sent a new one, QUICK!! It is bit big for my kitchen, but should be great for the grill."
"Unlike the size of the ladle and the color, not too shiny, won‚Äôt rust"
Great for cast iron; both for tossing/turning foods and scraping bits off bottom and side. Throw in dishwasher to wash.
Sturdy (metal core?). Seamless so no gunk gets in seams or cracks. Well made. Would buy again.
Sturdy and easy to use. No more stains on the utensils. üëçüòä
"I think these spatulas are great. What I like best is that they are all in one piece, so there are no seams for food or moisture to hide in and turn moldy. The spatulas are also quite sturdy/heavy duty. They are not tiny like some of the ones I've seen for sale. These are excellent for mixing, folding, saut√©ing etc. Maybe not so great for scooping things out of jars as the head of the spatula might not fit, but a good multi-function kitchen tool nonetheless. I've been using them for several months and could not be more pleased. No nicks or tears so far, though I do keep them away from my blender and food processor blades. I'd definitely buy these again."
"Many of these kinds of spatulas are either rock solid (not so good for getting things out of irregularly shaped containers) or flimsy-no power at all. The heat resistance is why I ordered them: I had what I thought was a good spatula, but it melted on the heating surface. The multicolors in one package allow for a meat, dairy, and pareve set all in one."
Terrific silicone spatulas in a perfect size for my needs. Sturdy yet flexible without being floppy. Bought a 2nd set because the first set worked so well and used so often they were always in the dishwasher.  If you're looking for silicone spatulas these just might be the right ones for you!
We love these one piece rubber spatulas!! We had the classic rubber spatulas with the plastic handles but they would get gross inside where the two pieces came together. I am so happy that we found these. They are sturdy and the perfect size. We have the small and large sizes and they are great!!
We lost our original spatulas to a mouse attack. Really disgusting. So after a dedicated trapping session we replace our spatulas with these. They are slightly smaller than the spatulas that they replaced and we were concerned that the size may be an issue. Turned out to not be an issue at all. Actually they are a great size to get into jars and scraping smaller bowls. Very happy with this purchase.
"Now that we've used the spatulas for a few weeks since purchasing, we are quite pleased with them. The handles are very sturdy and comfortable and they are efficiently clear whatever food we use them for. Our only suggestion is that we would prefer if the spatula heads were a little thicker or more rigid than they are. But overall, we are happy with them."
"The spatulas are long enough, and the heads are just a little smaller than typical spatulas, but not too small to be useful. They fit nicely in a variety of jars and do nearly as good a job scraping as rubber spatulas used to. Plus, they‚Äôre heat tolerant and dishwasher safe. I can stir saut√©ing vegetables with them and drop them into the dishwasher; fewer things to hand wash."
"We have given away all of our other spatulas in favor of this style of silicone spatulas. They are useful and indestructible. The best feature is that they are all one piece. With the two-piece style, you can either take them apart to clean them or have mold and bacteria growing in the crevice where the handle fits into the head. Taking them apart is a nuisance, and not taking them apart is yucky. These one-piece silicone spatulas have no crevices in which mold and bacteria can grow."
"These have their internal Stainless Steel support extends into the blade, making them sturdier than the average. Yet the silicone rubber allows them to flex well to follow contours of bowls, jars, cans, etc. And of course the high temperature rating means you can use them at any stage of your cooking. I got these during a ""Lightning Deal"" (25% off) so I'm just that much happier! Great spatulas / scrappers, zero problems, nice price."
"I was replacing similar items with more of a spoon head when I bought these, so I wasn't sure if they'd be as useful -- but they are! I'm very, very happy with them and use them all the time to saute vegetables, scramble eggs, stir cookie and cake batter -- for just about everything. The items they replaced were in two pieces and the seal between the handle and head was loosening and taking in water when washed. Ugh. I'm especially happy these are in one piece! Highly Recommended!"
"These spatulas work great. They're flexible enough to get everything, but not too flimsy. Just perfect in my opinion. They're a tiny bit smaller than some of my old ones, but barely - and it really doesn't make a difference. They're a good size for practically everything.  I especially love that they're all one piece. There's nowhere for all the gross stuff to get into and collect if you're not consistent about taking them apart every time you clean them, like with regular spatulas.  The bright colors are a plus."
reasonably priced and working well. They are soft tipped but this works great for cleaning out bowls of batter and such. They work well to stir things in a hot pan too but not like a wooden spoon would. they wash so easy usually do by hand but have put in dishwasher with no problem. Really like them and use a lot  Been using for a month now and it is my favorite spatula!
"I hate that they are made in China, but this is one of the few items that are actually of quality that come from there. I honestly don't think I have owned a better set. They are sturdy, great heat resistance, easy to clean & hold their color. I waited a while to write this review, I have put these through the test and they passed without a hitch."
"These replaced my older silicone spatulas, which had seen a lot of use (probably 10+ years!) and were nicked and worn. After using these new ones for about a month, all the cooks in my family are fans. They have a good heft and balance and the edges are nicely tapered. The colors are fun and bright. I hope they hold up well, because I really like them!"
"Silicone, so obviously heat resistant, pretty sturdy as well... As a chocolatier I go thru these quite often but I won't need to replace these for a while... Good buy... I'll order more"
"These spatulas are colorful, sturdy and come in a few shapes and sizes so they will meet any kitchen/cooking needs. I have used them when baking and when needing to mix ingredients while hot and there was no problem with either temperature.They are easy to clean and seem to be tight at the handle so no mloisture can get in between the handle and spatula."
I loves these spatulas! They hold up well to everyday use. I can run them though the dishwasher without fear of wood drying out. And the spatula head is strong enough to scrape batter but yet still flexible. Highly recommended.
"With the exception of the handle, which I find a tad too rounded (I tend to like very flat handles so that when I hang them, more spatulas can hang on the same hook and take up less space) I love love love this product. If you don‚Äôt have a bunch of other stuff crowding your hooks, this item is perfect. The design let‚Äôs you get to the edges of bowls perfectly."
"Love these rubber scraper/spatulas. They are small enough to fit in a jar without shredding the edges and sturdy enough use hand mixing stiff batter. I also use them as a spatula to turn eggs and the bright colors make them easy to find in my utensil crock on the counter. Instead of throwing out the old one, I have it with my paint supplies as the tool to scrape out my paint tray and can so no waste!"
"Just received these and they have met my expectations. Worked at various temperatures without any issues. Easy to clean (manually and dishwasher). So far, no fading, cracking or other problems. Good size as well."
"For any kind of cooking in non-stick pans these are the best! Sturdy enough to stir, flexable to scrape the sides, scrape the insides of jars to get the last bit out. I bought one in a set of utensils and as soon as i used it to make scrambled eggs I ordered 4 more!"
I love the traditional spatula shape. The one piece design does not allow a space for food to deposit. They are lightweight but firm when in use. The spatulas wash well in the dishwasher. I would purchase these again.
"Me encantaron ., exactamente las que necesitaba para la reposteria y preparaciones de alimentos caseros. Muy Funcionales .Al ser planas , las masas y alimentos se manejan mucho major. Y el ser en varios colores hermosos nos permite separarlas para dulces y salados . Muchas gracias"
I recently disposed of all of my cooking utensils that had cracks and crevices that could trap moisture and grow molds. These spatulas are created with the handles and scraper as one fluid piece. The work well and the bright colors are cheerful. Good purchase:)
"Great product! Because it's encased in silicone, there no place for any gunk to accumulate, like in many other spatulas/scrapers. Silicone is nice and firm, but so much that it would scratch a pan or anything. I haven't fully tested the heat resistance yet, but so far that is adequate."
"I use these to make candy for my store. Love the design, and the heat resistance. They're also easy to clean."
Product quality is good. Amazon.com is the only place where you can find such items are the cheapest. Elsewhere either pricier or quality not good.
It is so good and quality product . I love it is one piece .I use it for icing mostly so good quality
These are perfect smaller spatula. I gave them as stocking stuffers for the ladies in our family. I have several in my own kitchen and they are the go-to ones for cooking and food preparation. They can withstand heat as I use them while I am cooking. There are larger ones like these that are good for the big jobs and they are equally recommended.
I was hoping for something a little softer like I used to have but these are probably better in that they are more sturdy.
"When necessary, I like having multiple scrapers for several recipes with different ingredients, going on at the same time. So far, they have held up to use very well."
"These are my favorite spatulas of all time! So cute, sleek, and durable. I'm obsessed with them!"
These spatulas work great in nonstick cookware and are safe in the dishwasher!
"Silicone spatulas with solid cores have replaced spoons for most cooking uses in our kitchen. This set was very well made and priced and is functioning well on the stove, in mixing bowls etc. I prefer spatulas that are slightly firmer at the tip but these are just fine"
"I got these because I love baking. They're flexible, but not too flexible to scrape up brownie batter in a mixer. I wish it was more stiff, but it does do its job with ease. Super easy to clean. I just throw it in the dishwasher."
"Awesome! Right blend of sturdiness and flexibility. I‚Äôve used in everything from cooking, scooping peanut butter, folding in delicate egg whites and whipped creams, mixing heavy oat filled cookie batters, rice dishes in an instant pot and in a stoneware and they have been great. Super easy to clean no matter what‚Äôs been cooked. Vibrant colors. Convenient lengths."
Very strong and durable spatula. Very happy with purchase.
i absolutely LOVE these. i have some that the handle will either break or will come of but these stand up to the durability test. i use them everyday as i like to bake.
they did not melt in pan i like them would buy again.
I just love them! No matter what I use them for they clean right up; The pans my family uses with them don't clean up very well. Perfect sized also. I bought some of these last year and cannot live without them - my dogs love to chew them up if they can get them (the only things these dogs chew on so they must taste great too).
"I wasn‚Äôt sure that these would do the trick, but they were perfect for the science lab."
Nothing gets stuck on these and they are easy to clean just can‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher.
"Solid, bendy, nice colors, good in the dishwasher."
These are so sturdy and easy to use and clean. You will love them.
"Nice to have a set of flexible, sturdy spatulas that are one piece so mold won't start where the handle goes into the blade. I ordered a 4 pack, but only received two, but the seller responded immediately and sent the missing two. Great seller, great spatulas."
I use a lot of spatulas apparently. These are phenomenal!
These arrived fast and as expected. They are durable and easy to clean. Love the color choices. The silicone spatula is all one piece and they are more flexible so they don't snap in half. I will never buy anything else. I plan to buy more for Christmas gifts!
"Absolute winner! Well build and high heat resistance. Love to use for actual cooking, not only for cleaning/¬´¬†licking¬†¬ª the pots üòä!"
I really like these as they are flexible yet strong. Love the colors too.
I grab these spatulas all day long. They're great for cooking high heat in a cast iron pan and for creaming butter and sugar when making cookie dough.
I love using silicone flat-type spatulas when cooking on the stove. I had a hard time finding a replacement for another spatula I‚Äôd used for years. Most I found were spoon-type spatulas. When I found these I snatched them up. Love them! Easy to use and clean.
"Nice and colourful and they are quite sturdy and have held up well with all sorts of heavy culinary use. It‚Äôs great to have multiples when you‚Äôre baking and don‚Äôt have to wash it to use again, just grab another one."
Easy to handle and well made. Flexible enough to get that last bit of mayonnaise at the bottom of the jar. The handles are very comfortable and strong. No problems with heat.
These are a gift. I am sure she will like them.
I used them on my waffle maker to remove the waffles without breaking them. They really worked. I love them!
Love these Spatulas; all one piece construction! No more slide off head (allowing bacteria inside!). Soft enough to frost a cake but sturdy enough to brown beef in the skillet.
I gave these in Christmas bags and included the matching scoop spatulas. Everyone was glad to get some new ones!
They are flexible on the spatula edge but very solid through the handle. I would definitely recommend these!
These guys are great! A little on the smaller side for spatulas but they still work great. They also add some color to my utensil crock which is fun too! Would recommend
"Great spatula, sturdy, one piece, sharp edges clean into crevices Would buy again."
Very happy with purchase
I love these spatulas! I can get every drop of whatever I'm mixing out of the bowl using these spatulas. They are so easy to clean I often don't bother putting them in the dishwasher (although they are dishwasher safe).
I have bought these spatulas before and I will buy again
"Love the bright colors, easy to find in drawer"
Great set. Each one is wrapped individually. Not sure if they are heat resistant - I haven't tried. Good price for the item.
These are the perfect length to scrape down a 20qt mixing bowl and light enough to go easy on the wrist. They out preform my other restaurant quality spatulas for sure. I highly recommend these especially if you prefer to use silicone spatulas in the kitchen often.
"All one piece, easy to handle, normal size spatulas, easy to clean.....and heat resistant!"
"I originally bought these spatulas in 2018, and have loved them. After about 2 years of daily use, two of the spatulas cracked and split. For the price, I'm okay with a 2 year lifespan. I just ordered a second set."
I like the core it so sturdy & love the colors.
My husband likes that it‚Äôs one piece - the spatula doesn‚Äôt separate from a wooden handle
Just used this blue silicone spatula for the the first time today for turning eggs in a non-stick pan and it worked perfectly! I was easily able to get under the eggs to turn them without any trouble. The silicone held up perfectly to the heat and the spatula was flexible enough to turn the eggs without any damage. I am very happy with my purchase and will probably buy another for my daughter and her family.
I really do like the spatula over the rest of mine
this tool is great! Initially bought to use for fish as the description says but then realized it actually works with everything and is my go to spatula now! The silicon is great as it doesn‚Äôt damage my non stick pans but it can also be use with cast iron or stainless steel ones too.
I've used it maybe 2 orn3 times. It works. Time will tell if it's a good product
Love this tool. The silicon is perfect for my non stick pans too. I got this spatula because I cook salmon often but now I use this spatula literally every time I need one.
Most versatile spatula - if you only have space for one this is the one to get. Perfect for use of non-stick pots and pans and as good for stainless steel.
"Almost every morning I cook eggs for breakfast for my wife and I. Many times I will make omelets that require ""folding."" This spatula is perfect for that. I like the fact it is a hybrid design of both stainless steel and a silicone edge. The edge will protect my delicate non-stick pan coatings.  Spatulas that are all plastic tend to wear out and break after a few months. Although time will tell, this spatula should last a lot longer due to its stainless steel frame construction.  The angle of the blade is just right for easily getting under the edge of the egg. The handle is comfortable. The width of the blade is perfect for turning eggs. It just works well.  I couldn't find anything I don't like about it. I recommend it."
"I am an avid cook at home. I like to make breakfast and dinners for the family. Over the years, I have been swapping utensils made of wood and stainless to help me flip over eggs, omelets, fish, shrimps, scallops, etc. with some degree of success and some failures.  I recently purchased some new nonstick cookware requiring me to rethink about the ladles, turners, tongs, and spatulas at my disposal. Most of what I have will scratch the new cookware and so I started my search for something new.  Behold Misen Fish Spatula! I never seen this type of combination of silicone and stainless steel spatula! I tell you, flipping eggs and omelets are 100 times easier than my thinnest turner. This spatula has enough strength to lift and the big surface area of the slots provides so much leverage to flip eggs like I have never done before. I don‚Äôt have to use 2 turners at one time as this spatula can do it in one motion. Moving on to fish, too easy but still need to be careful as some fish are delicate. This spatula gives me so much control which is key. I love being able to lift the fish off the frying pan and peek at how much sear has been achieved underneath and then gently putting it back on the pan.  This spatula was made for nonstick cookware. No more scratches. It also works with all my stainless steel cookware with no issues. The handle is also silicone and seems durable enough to last me a long time in my kitchen.  It is dishwasher safe and heat resistant up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Very easy to clean (let it soak a bit and everything comes off so much easier)  So glad I have this and will recommend to all. 5 Stars!"
"Been eyeing one of these for a while, as watching Top Chef and other cooking shows, they always have a fish spatula in their knife rolls, even when not cooking fish. I can now see why - they feel way more precise than a regular spatula, which feels ham-fisted and clunky in comparison.  On the bottom side of mine, there‚Äôs a small gap between the silicone edging and the metal, where food/gunk can get caught (pic). Seems like the adhesive wasn‚Äôt applied sufficiently there, and pressing it back down only helps briefly. Would normally overlook this, but worth mentioning due to the $~5 (~50%) premium over similarly styled generic silicone edged fish spatulas here.  There‚Äôs a tiny gap between the ‚Äúblade‚Äù and the handle, but unlike some cheaper versions, water doesn‚Äôt seem to get stuck in there."
"Finally, a fish spatula that doesn't scratch even my most delicate cookware. This is an example of a perfect design. The silicone border is just where it should be, why didn't anyone think of something like this sooner? Well at least I'm glad someone did. It's able to slide under even the most fragile fish, yet has all of the flexibility and sturdiness of the traditional all metal fish spatula. Afterwards, I just put it in the dishwasher, and it comes out just fine. If you try it you'll never use your metal one again, except perhaps on your barbecue grill."
I‚Äôve seen these used for flipping fish but have never had the chance to use one. It is definitely worth the purchase. Get the right tools for the job. It‚Äôs way more flexible than my other spatula and therefore has more control and you can be more delicate. worth the purchase.
"I don't like this Misen fish spatula as much as I expected to, and it's the first item of theirs that's a bit of a miss for me. Everything from their brand so far has been of very high quality. This is of high quality as well, it's just a bit narrow and stiff for a fish spatula. The type of fish for which you most need such a utensil is thin, delicate white fish like flounder. A wider spatula ensures it won't break apart when lifting, and a more flexible metal enables you to more easily get under the fish."
"A few months ago, I replaced my nonstick pans, and with them I also made sure to replace any metal utensil that could come in contact with them. Spatulas were a problem with this, as the plastic or silicone ones I had around were either too thick, or not strong enough. This ""fish spatula"" solves the problem by combining a basically metal spatula with the protection of silicone around the edges. My nonstick pans seem to be happy with it, and so am I. So far, I have tried it on the stovetop with eggs, omelets, pancakes and French toast, but it is also turning into my spatula of choice anytime I want to get something dry out of the pan that doesn't require tongs - I like the larger surface and the fact that it is so thin. It has also become my tool of choice if I want to separate something baked from parchment paper (or the so-called non-stick baking pan) - the silicone layer is still sturdy enough to push through the baked-on goods, and thanks to the thinness of the blade, damage to the shape is minimal. It washes nicely in the dishwasher - I've had it for almost two weeks now, and it found its way there about 10 times, which, with the number of gadgets in my kitchen, is pretty exceptional. Looking forward to enjoying it."
"Misen is quickly becoming one of my favorite cookware brands. I feel late to the party. Looking around online, apparently Misen has something of a cult following for their cookware. It's definitely high quality and good enough for professional chefs.  I was looking for an upgrade to my dinky plastic spatula that has melted over and over again the past few years. I'd occasionally leave it too close to the burner or on a hot pan and it just turns to goo. So I thought this would be a good all around spatula to replace that old melted one. And I wasn't wrong. This thing rocks! It's perfect for just about everything from omelettes to fish. It's super thin and strong, and best of all it's long enough to get all the way underneath a steak or large piece of fish. My old spatula was more of a square shape and couldn't really carry much on its own, forcing me to use a second spatula on the other side or the aid of a fork.  Simple and classic, this thing is amazing. It's dishwasher safe and I think it'll be around in my kitchen for years to come. I definitely feel the upgrade I was hoping for!"
This fish spatula with the silicone top and side covering is great for any type of pot but I particularly scooped this up to use with my non-stick pans. It‚Äôs sturdy and flips well. It has a nice flex to it but doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. The heat resistance is great up to 450¬∞! The handle feels really good in my hand and it‚Äôs super easy to clean. Definitely recommend!
"We‚Äôve pan grilled fish and seared both scallops and shrimp using this spatula and it worked absolutely beautifully. We only use silicon utensils now, to protect our pans, so this is the best tool for both delicate foods and delicate pans with non-stick coating.  It‚Äôs angled perfectly to carefully flip shrimp with ease and still firm enough to scrape up the brown bits in the pan. Has an easy-grip, comfortable handle.  Washed well in the dishwasher too. A must have in the kitchen that will improve the way you cook seafood."
Great for fish but I use it for everything. I like spatula because it has a protective side covering that doesn't scratch pans. Great for flipping eggs.
""
"I cook fish every week and I normally don't use a turner with a silicone edge, but my goodness this just slid right under the fish with ease! I have ventured out to also try this with a few other things such as scallion pancakes and such and it works well!  Fair Price Comfortable Handle Silicone edge on fish turner Dishwasher safe No damage to pans"
"Misen Fish Spatula was a disaster for me. ATK recommends fish spatulas so I thought I'd give it a try. Structurally it's well built, the non stick edge worked. But I could not flip anything, things fell off, fell over, I could not get anything to flip. I hated this spatula and gave it away first chance."
"metal ,plastic heat resistant handle great for use with metal ,stainless and cast iron pans ( do not use on non stick pans) perfect shape and size"
"Have loved all of my Misen products! I‚Äôve used the fish spatula for chicken Parmesan, eggs, toasting buns, and just about anything else you can think of! Love that it is dishwasher safe too!"
"I use it for everything, this is overall really a great spatula"
This is the perfect fish spatula. Great for non stick pans!
"After purchasing several other misen products, including the knife and cookware set, I knew I could count on Misen for the smaller tools as well. This is a great fish spatula. It‚Äôs very sturdy and can be used for more than just fish! I‚Äôve already used it for burgers and chicken!"
"I love a good fish spatula, and this is the best we've had in my house so far. The slightly smaller size makes it very useful."
I really like this turner. It's lightweight but well made. Hope it will last.

"As the packaging said its dishwasher safe, i put the spatulas in the dishwasher right out of the package so I could use them ASAP. They all came out of the dishwasher with soap scum/streaks all over them. I scrubbed them by hand to clean them off and tried to wash them again on the next dish load to see if it's a one off thing. Nope, came out with soap streaks all over them even though I haven't used them yet.  I have attached a pic to compare my old spatula that's breaking and the new ones. All fresh out of the dishwasher. Returning these :("
"Just arrived yesterday. Much needed new set. We usually get hard plastic but figured we‚Äôd try these. Nice silicone texture. Handle seems flimsy. I have yet to use them but I‚Äôm writing an initial review within a certain time frame for reimbursement. I may come back and update this review after use.  UPDATE: made eggs with one of the spatulas yesterday. Works well and is sturdy. I like that the silicone doesn‚Äôt scratch the non stick pan coating . I‚Äôll increase the product from 3 to 5 stars.  By the way, I have yet to receive reimbursement. Instead I received an email asking to delete my original review and to write a good review. Regardless of this request, I decided to keep the original review and provide an update with honest, transparent information."
"These silicon spatulas are fantastic - perfect in every way! They are heat resistant - no melting spatulas and then peeling and breaking off into your food. They are sturdy and easy to clean (dishwasher safe). Just don't allow the handles to rest on the hot surface, as the handles are not heat resistant. Great purchase!"
"So many of the reviews here were written shortly after their delivery. I can say that so far they look as if they are going to be a welcome addition to our kitchen. But I hope to be able to remember to give an updated review after a few months of use. I would have liked to be able to see a review like that. So, we'll give them a real workout and come back to let you know how they do over the long haul. We've used them four times with our new ceramic coated skillets, and they are doing great."
"These spatulas are very good quality and sturdy. Not flimsy at all. The come in 4 different shapes and sizes, varying in length and width and work for everything ranging from flipping tortillas and burger patties to making scrambled eggs. Some of the pros are : 1) Their silicon is BPA free, FDA approved and heat resistant which is why I prefer using these spatulas as compared to my existing other plastic spatulas. 2) I can visibly see the difference with use as my existing plastic spatula has scraped from the sides but this silicon spatulas are perfect and easy to clean. 3) Their steel core makes them more sturdy and provides a great grip when holding or flipping food. 4) The grip is slip resistant and cushioned so my hands do not start to pain with over use. 5) They come in varying sizes and the widest one can even help hold a pizza"
I love this new set. I wanted to have something other than wood to use in my new cookware that doesn‚Äôt love metal. Only thing that bothers me is they spot when cleaned in the dishwasher.
"Great product and with 4 pieces there is a size for everything I will cook. Very sturdy and good quality. Great price for what you get. A little hard to clean (a little bit of grease residue remains) but I‚Äôm sure I will find something to clean it well. Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this product."
This is a very nice high-quality set of silicone kitchen spatulas. They were just MUCH MUCH BIGGER than I expected! The four of them completely fill up one of my kitchen drawers. They are very sturdy and look as though they will last a lifetime. Paul Bunyan would love them!
"Large, very large spatulas! convenient for pancakes and eggs! they are simple to wash and they handle the heat super well! they are BPA free! that is really great! Also they arrives so on time that I could not believe it, I normally break the eggs when I fry them or when I take them out of the pan and these, spatulas arrived when I was making eggs! lol! and...I did not brake them thanks to the spatula's size! love them!"
"I really like these silicone spatulas. They are easy to use, easy to clean, they are sturdy, yet flexible. They take some getting used to if you are used to the old, hard plastic ones, but these are so much better. They are quite large and so that also took some getting used to, but I have found which one I love for flipping pancakes, hashbrowns, eggs, meat, etc. These ones are protecting my new ceramic cookware so well."
"Love these, especially the large round one for helping get the pizza off of the rack. It takes a little getting use to the rubber surrounding the hard inside because the rubber is more flimsy. You won‚Äôt have to worry about scratching anything!"
This is the best set of spatulas I have ever had. There is a variety of sizes and I use all of them. I plan to buy another set so if one is dirty I can pick up another one quickly. They are sturdy and easy to use. I have been using them regularly for a few months and they look good as new with each wash. They are easy to clean and very heat resistant. Very happy with them.
"These spatulas are amazing!! I can‚Äôt even begin to express how happy I am with this purchase. I love that they come in 4 different sizes, I just made eggs over easy this morning with the big wide one and they flipped perfect and I didn‚Äôt even break a yolk! Buy these spatulas!!!!! YOU WON‚ÄôT REGRET IT!!!!!"
Love these spatulas! They work great for lifting food off my non stick griddle. No complaints. I did give 4 out of 5 stars for sturdiness as some of the spatulas dont have the reinforced metal going all the way to the tip. So not as sturdy if you are trying to flip heavier items. But not all of them are like that. Worth the money to purchase!
"These badboys would flip a pancake the size of your head, I mean...if you're into that kind of thing. :) And who isn't, really? They are a wee bit awkward to use in a smaller frying pan, so be aware of that. Overall decent product that hasn't melted - yet. :)"
The products are similar to OXO at a reduced price. They operate just as well. Only issue I had is that geekhom warranty can only be activated if you post a positive review. I will not be held hostage for a review.
The largest one is really great for getting enchilladas out of the pan.
"I'm trying to avoid melting plastics in my food, yet don't want to risk destroying my pans with metal utensils. These get the job done but avoid melting like cheaper plastics."
"These things are AWESOME, doesn't hurt your pans, you know have the right flipper for that special size patty, or larger omelet or casserole. Very easy to clean, and sturdy."
So I had a cheap silicone/plastic spatula and that biscuit slowly melted over time. This set has surpassed my expectations. It is extremely useful and I can easily clean it after use. It doesn't scratch my pan and is sturdy. So glad I made this purchase.
"These have a great feel to them and work well. The size of these are large. Both my wife and I commented over it and it does take a little different technique to use, but nothing that effects performance, and gives you better control on eggs and pancakes."
"Perfect for everyday use. These spatulas are great for all your cooking needs. Comfortable handles and contoured edges make flipping, stirring and serving a breeze."
"This product is definitely a 5 star!! I have been struggling to find good spatulas ling or big enough for recepes like pancakes! I found this set and I so pleased! I have use all of them and they are great heat resistance, and overall the quality is just great! I totally recommend this product to friends and family!"
These are the best spatulas i have ever owed in 60 years.
"They come in a box that is different than pictured. Not a big deal, just something I noticed. They feel a lot more sturdy than they appear. They seem to be decent quality but I just got them. Haven‚Äôt used them yet. Will update if I don‚Äôt forget."
"This set of spatulas is life changing. The spatulas are large, silicone and heat resistant. They are flexible while being sturdy enough to flip numerous items. The large round spatula is perfect to flip quesadillas! I haven't botched one flip since I got this set. They clean easily in the top rack of the dishwasher. Highly recommend!"
"I mainly purchased the set for the large spatula, since I make large pancakes. All pieces seem to be great and will be replacing some of my older utensils."
"As soon as the spatulas arrived I threw away my olds ones. Washed the new GEEKHOM spatulas and put them to use right away browning hamburger meat. I tried all of them and they work great. I have a gas range that will heat a handle up in a heart beat. Not these, they stayed cool and didn‚Äôt melt. I plan on giving a set away as a wedding gift."
"I cook and bake almost every day. Freezer meals, Soups, stews. casseroles. Mexican and Italian cuisine!!! Best tools!!!"
"These are just perfect, and are truly easy to clean. I had an issue, and customer service was fantastic. I'd buy more if I need them, and would definitely buy as gifts."
"The set is nice. The tools are larger than I am used to, but they work great. They are flexible which is also something I‚Äôm not used to, but they flip eggs and pancakes just fine. Good set for the price."
"I am liking my new spatulas. I like them because they are sturdy, heat resistant (to 600 degrees) and easy to clean. I like the different shapes and sizes. (They replaced a spatula that was warped and one that had gotten too hot.)"
"For everyone reviewing these that complain about the large size, the measurements are clearly there. these are extremely heat resistant and aren't as floppy as other reviewers have made them out to be. They are not stiff per se, but they are high quality and well worth the price."
"Sturdy and good large sizes with the standard turner for normal cooks. Sturdy but flexible. Great for turning eggs without damaging yolk so it runs. Haven't exposed to temps over 400 yet, but happy so far."
My husband is using this on his camping trips. Very sturdy and heat resistant.
"Our turners arrived right on time, and we couldn't be more pleased. Only been used around 6-10 times so far, but the heat resistance has been awesome, the turners are sturdy, and the food just plain doesn't stick like our old ones. Great deal!"
"Easy to use and easy to clean, stronger than previously used utensils"
"They were a Christmas gift for my mom. She wanted a thing spatula that would work well for omelets. She loves these and uses them daily, however they are much bigger than you may expect."
Love the non-slip grip. Spatulas are sturdy and the variety of them are great! Made an omelette right away and it‚Äôs never been easier. They are quite large FYI
This set is perfect for my non-stick skillets. It also works well in high heat.
My college daughter needed utensils for her apartment and these were economical and functional
"Easy to clean, functional, works well with ceramic pans. No worry of scratching. Would recommend to others!"
"Perfect for outdoor grills as well as electric skillets, we definitely buy more soon"
I like that they are sturdy and heat resistant. I've had them a couple of weeks and use them everyday. I would purchase again
"We are finally able to toss all those hard-plastic partly-melted turners, including some expensive name-brand items. My husband says the edges are not quite stiff enough for turning eggs, and he would like to add a more slender turner (I'm looking), but it is wonderful not to wonder how much plastic we are eating. No more melted turners!"
"Felt strong, didn‚Äôt bend easily with heavy food"
Pretty nice set of spatulas. They are much larger than I would have liked. But overall they work very well. The high temp silicone does a very good job and doesn‚Äôt stick to anything. I‚Äôm pretty pleased with the overall set.
The spatulas are good quality. Recommend.
Good product. Thanks a lot.
"This is a great set of spatulas, I made the mistake of leaning the handle on my hot frying pan and it melted it some, he'd thier warning about that. Otherwise I'm happy with this purchase."
I am glad I purchased these spatulas. They are very sturdy and work well in the kitchen!
"Gave this to my daughter in law, she loved them."
"Very sturdy , easy to use and I love the variety of sizes . No issues so far"
"Great kitchen utensils, esp with non-stick surfaces on pans! Very sturdy, flexible and easy to use. Attractively and well made. Also, easy to clean. I would recommend them to my friends!"
Great replacements so far. Been a few months and no wear and tear.
A spatula size for every job
Have used these everyday for a week. They are as described. Will be buying more.
"These are great spatulas. Easy to clean, non-stick and will not melt while using them like the plastic ones. They are large enough for omelets and quesadillas that the smaller ones can‚Äôt flip. Flexible and easy to use, but due to size and silicone, may not support heavy items."
"Quality products, nice verity of sizes. The silicon is well made. Easy to clean."
I love this set. No more melting spatulas in our food. So happy with these spatulas.
They seem to be made well. I would recommend them to anyone that needs LARGE spatulas. Will be great for turing pancakes!
Good product
"I have only used 1 of them but I was very happy with it. The silicone part it's very flexible and seems durable. FYI I don't know if only mine are like that but they are black, but very clear black semi translucent color, not dark black like most products. Anyways, I'm happy with my product so far."
"Heat resistant to the high heat of 600 degrees F, cleans easy, holds meat and veggies with confidence. Will buy more when I can find ladles and other tools."
"This product is a set of tools that are high quality and easily maneuverable, especially when compared to the competing products that are thick, bulky bulky and awkward to use... as advertised: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQ7LLDM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details"
"Great for use in the kitchen and they cleanup in no time. Works well flipping eggs, pancakes, large burgers and huge omelets."
"Truly a combo of spatulas for any situation. I was looking at spatulas at my looking store, and the prices for silicone spatulas seemed incredibly high. I decided to check on Amazon, and I found these. I decided to purchase them, and I do not regret it at all. The long flexible one has been amazing for making Omelets. I highly recommend this set."
Works wonderful for us had to replace my old recommended
"I think they're great, just larger than I was anticipating. All of them are kind of unwieldy in a 10 inch pan"

"It‚Äôs make of good material and is sturdy and flexible. Thanks to the ergonomic design and no slip handle, when use those turners on my wok and pan, it was a perfect experience. Besides, it‚Äôs literally easy to clean, even don‚Äôt need to wash it with dish soap, just rinse with tap water and use kitchen towel to dry it. Overall I those are best turners and highly recommend!"
These silicone spatulas are tremendously easy to clean. Food just practically wipes off easily. I can strongly recommend them.
Quality set. Seems durable and works well. Easy to clean. I've had issues in the past with other cheaper products where the edge melts and needs to be trimmed periodically. I was especially looking to avoid that. These seem to be the answer so far.
"These are the best spatulas I've seen. I have thrown out all the others I had once I used these. They are easy to clean, no eggs, etc. sticking on them and they feel nice in your hand."
"We were looking for an upgrade to the plastic cooking utensils one can buy in the grocery store and we are super pleased with these! They are very sturdy and don't flex when you flip or mix large quantities of food. We haven't had to worry about these melting when next to the burner and food easily comes off of them. We've been able to put them in the dishwasher without a problem. They are on the thicker side so maybe not the best for very delicate tasks like crepes, but we've successfully used them for everything from eggs to pancakes to stir fry to turning veggies in the oven and the set has been great! These are definitely a step up in quality from plain plastic and we are very happy with them after a few months of use."
These are wonderful tools that really work well! I expect many years of good cooking with them.
These are perfect for the color scheme in my house and yes they work wonderfully cooking with them‚ù£Ô∏è
"These are perfect for every time I use a spatula. I typically used a metal spatula, but I hated the idea of metal scraping metal. These are a great alternative. Also, they slide easily under cookies and pancakes much better than my metal spatula."
"Strong, stylish and easy to clean. Works great with non stick pans. Highly recommend!"
"The spatula set seem very durable, and not at all flimsy. I've only had them for a short time, but have used all three, and so far, no burned or melted edges. My old spatulas all burned with my hot flame Wolf."
Husband loves them because he no longer has the problem of flipping his eggs and the egg getting stuck on the spatula. I would recommend to anyone.
Works good. Looks good. I've been using these spatulas with no problems. Happy with my purchase.
Nice sturdy and pretty. Dishwasher safe. Safe for nonstick pans. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of these utensils. Very happy with purchase.
"These are wonderful since they have the silicone coating, more functional than just using a spatula."
"I love this product. Not too heavy, not too light; not too thin, not too thick.... these tools are just right!"
"I would have liked them to be a bit thinner, it makes it easier to slide under the food rather than push it. They are sturdy but I would have preferred thinner ones."
"I love these. Easy to grip, easy to use and they don't get chipped and scratch anything. Plastic can't hold a candle to these."
I was fearful of the silicone. It works nice with everything we have used it for.
Love these very durable food don‚Äôt stick to end of spatula . Wash up nice
"Mom needed new spatulas, so Santa put some in her stocking. Favorite ones she's had."
"Great turners, big enough to hold onto and sturdy construction."
Good Sturdy kitchen utensils. Nice color. Worth to buy.
This set is very sturdy. Would like to find some other pieces.
I made scrambled eggs and pancakes and worked great for both. No more scratched pans!
"Love these silicone spatulas! I was hesitant to purchase them because they seemed a little expensive compared to other spatulas, but I am really glad I decided to give them a chance. I was looking for something that would hold up to really high heat. These have truly exceeded my expectations. So easy to clean, holds up to high heat, and very well made. And I love the blue color! Five stars!"
Great. High heat safe. Watt Easy to clean.
love these silacone items they are so good to use
Works good the slightly softer tip makes it easy scrap everything out
These are really well made and very sturdy. I like the fact that are longer than most.
I'm buying the other color too!
"They are perfect - strong, but easy on my cookware."
Perfect for general kitchen use
"Great set of silicone spatulas for the price. Nice variety, size, and quality."
"DESLON BPA Free & Food Grade Silicone Spatulas - High Heat Resistant Non-Stick Silicone Rubber Spatula set, are very good high quality. They were delivered promptly and properly. Very good service!"
These are wonderful. It is a pleasure cooking with them.
Work great
Just what we expected! Great!
"I love the way they feel in hand, they are all nice and firm, easy to care fore. Bought a second set as a gift for my sister and she loves them too! Not afraid they will break when applying pressure. Terrific design."
They are really nice utensils
Like all adpects
"These look pretty, but they don't work well. When trying to flip pancakes they just scrunched them up. Also the main turning spatula isn't flat, the sides have edges so it is not versatile. I returned them, and would not recommend."
"I've had this set a while, used it extensively, and cannot say enough good things about it. They've held up great, are nice to look at, spring back to their original shape after use, easy to clean. I use them mostly on my cast iron pans and really love them. Don't know why the brand seems to be unavailable on Amazon now, because if it were I'd be buying slotted spoons!"
I bought these to replace my crappy Tu**erware ones that didn't take the heat like they were supposed to and melted over time and ruined my food. I bought these and my food gets scooped up nicely and these slide so easily under pancakes & fried eggs.
"My husband is very happy, and you can do eggs over easy. Bets thing ever"
"Silicone spatulas (turners) we have had in the past have failed because the metal covered by the silicone would become exposed and potentially damage cookware. It feels like there is not metal in maybe two of these. We'll see. Thought I didn't need three, but it's nice to put one or two in the dishwasher and still have one available to use."
After years of purchasing cheap spatulas and watching the end curl up from too high heat from normal use. I stopped these on Amazon and after a few months of use I can say it was a nice experience after my old ones. Mine still look new. Easy to wash .
These are too thick
Seem a little thick. Hard to get them under an egg or hamburger to flip them
"I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to discover this non stick utensils, I am thoroughly pleased with it! I used to have to soak my spatulas after use, but I promise these are a life saver, so easy to clean, time saver and absolutely great all around. Can withstand heat, sticky foods, and much more! Will definitely recommend!"
"Very nice looking. They are a bit thicker than I would prefer, making it more difficult to slide under an egg, but they are sturdy and seem to be of very nice quality. Overall I like them."
"Remember that these spatulas, being flexible, will not scrape of hard deposits of food from pans like a rigid plastic spatula would. Keep a rigid plastic one on hand for scraping"
Did not like the end thickness. Did not work very well when flipping pancakes.
It holds up to the heat. Does not burn at the ends. I would recommend this to anyone
Not too much to say. It's a great product and have used 2 of the three many times since they arrived and really like them.
"Ordered because I wanted smaller sizes, these are just the right size. Look good, great color for my kitchen. I have only had them for a few days so cannot review on how they hold up. Seem to work just fine. Would order again."
"Silicon spatulas save time cooking and are a snap to clean. These are well made, ergonomic and the red adds some color to the kitchen! Great products and I'd purchase again!"
A little thick to get under food easily in a smaller frying pan. But love them. They don't burn or melt or smell like they do. Eggs wipe off easily!!!
"All they advertised to be, great buy. Cleans up effortlessly. Love them."
"I purchased these utensils to go with the ceramic, non stick skillet I purchased for my neighbor. These are essential for keeping your skillet in excellent working order."
"These spatulas are made of very strong material, heat resistant. They are absolutely beautiful, black and red. Great for turning pancakes, eggs, etc. They are flexible, but very strong. Will buy them again."
"Very pleased with the turners. I haven‚Äôt actually used them yet, will today. But they feel strong and sturdy. I put them on very top utensil tray in dishwasher and they came out very nice. Love the color combination."
A nice set of spatulas. They are very light and very stiff and don‚Äôt melt. The best plastic style spatulas I have ever used.
Just right for non stick fry pans. Bends a little to get under fried eggs without breaking the yoke Look good and very easy clean up
"A little thick, however they work well"
I really like these. I thought they would be too thick but I can turn eggs easily!
This product is oversized and awkward. The actual spatula flat part is super short and not sturdy
Easy to use. It doesn't damage a pretty expensive non stick pan. I'll buy it again.
All good. I just wish they were just a tiny bit shorter to fit on a hanging rod I have. Finally found the kind that don‚Äôt melt when cooking scrambled eggs or browning meat.
Ordered these for good heat resistance and utility. Seem to have gotten both. Great product.
Work good
A beautiful set and excellent product-delivery was fast and packaging was perfect-

"I‚Äôve been trying to eat more fish. And, I only had the square spatulas for sandwiches and such. I tried using them and they ended up crumbling more fish than I‚Äôd like.  I saw several ‚Äúchefs‚Äù using these wider longer metal fish spatulas. Their pieces of fish were easily picked up and flipped/served. So, why not try.  I didn‚Äôt want a plastic one, metal made more sense (plastic ones always end up melting on the end). This one is metal and it runs the length of the handle, rivet between a plastic handle. So, solid all the way through. And it‚Äôs kind of curved on the end so you can get under the fish easier.  I‚Äôm so glad I got one. I didn‚Äôt want another kitchen tool, but this has made life cooking fish a pleasure. And, I didn‚Äôt spend a fortune on it. Highly recommended."
"I don't like fish so never thought I needed this spatula. However, this works well for other foods. Cookies, other cooked meats etc. I would consider giving this as a gift."
"Having this tool has helped loads with flipping fish, fried eggs etc. I prefer to use this when cooking and have given away my old spatulas"
Finally a go to spatula that is sturdy! Worth the price!
This spatula is so great. It‚Äôs big to and helps you pick up more! Great purchase
Great for flipping sandwiches
Good product
I like that it's a fish spatula. I've never had one so it's pretty cool. The metal is loose in the handle though so that annoys me. I've only had it a week or two. It works well enough and was cheap enough so I don't know if i'll bother with a return. I'll probably use it for a bit and then buy a better quality one.
"I'm not sure why I waited so long to get a fish spatula. This thing is a great add to the utensil drawer. It's balanced, easy to use and performs perfectly with fish, as well as getting other tricky things done, e.g. the first piece of pie out of the pan, etc."
"Although I have not yet used it on fish, it did a great job moving delicate cookies from the baking sheet to the cooling rack."
"I use this all the time , not just for fish!"
I expect a fish spatula to be flexible. This is not flexible at all. Very disappointed
I love using this spatula for fish and delicate items.
I‚Äôve seen these used by chefs on TV and I absolutely love it! I wish I had bought it sooner I could‚Äôve eliminated some other utensils that I have in my kitchen.
Didn't like the quality that much
"Love the width, length, handle"
So far is good will let know after a few uses
Works well for it's intended purpose.
"Spatula is a lot sturdier than I was anticipating. I've used slotted spatulas before, but this one's a much better quality. Definitely recommend!"
I just saw this at a kitchen store for $38! Great tool
Everything
"Very good fish spatula at a great price. My only complaint is that food sticks easily to it and cleaning takes a little more muscle than I would have expected. But overall, very good and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be using it for years."
Wished it was a little more sturdy but the thinness of the edge makes it perfect for all types of spatula needs
Sturdy and large enough even for half a salmon. Owned for only four or five dishwasher cycles so time will tell.
The spatula could be thinner and more flexible.
"Great quality, sturdy spatula. Very thin and sharp. Can really remove fish in one piece."
"Love the feel, not to heavy and easy to work"
It slides under a big filet and bends enough to conform to it. Takes the tension out of preparation
This is super strong and seems well built.
It is long enough that food doesnt drop off. Sturdy and easy to use
Wonderful works great Not just with fish but anything that you‚Äôre cooking in a frying pan wonderful value for the price
"Sturdy, versatile kitchen tool. We use it for a myriad of dishes. Works like a charm!"
Glad spatula! Made this purchase as it's easy to use and stands up to wear and tear
"I never knew that I would need a fish spatula, ever! but of course it isnt just for FISH it use for anything a spatula calls for. Easier to use than my regular wooden ones. It is sturdy and great quality."
Very happy with product
I ordered two one for me and one for my daughter!
Just what I wanted.
Works great.
Works great with many food item. We love using it for fish.
I have used it once but it was very sturdy. It has been a good purchase so far.
Did the job. Great quality for the price. Both chefs I gifted to loved it!
This product is made in the U.S.A. Need I say more
Great product. Sturdy and works well!
I have needed a good spatula for a long time. Not only was this spatula good for fish but christmas cookies too.. Finally
"I love this spatula, it was a great price and I love the length and flexibility of it. It's great not only for fish but for omelets', pancakes etc."
So far it works well!
This kitchen tool is sturdy and good quality. A great addition to my kitchen
"I purchased this good fish spatula and it's has been great! I have been using it frequently and even though it's a fish spatula, it's use is very versatile. It can be used for many things. After using it, I put it in the dishwasher, dried it and hung it on the wall with my other kitchen utensils. I noticed that this is a very high quality spatula and easy to clean. I am an avid fan of this product... this brand, their quality, their usability and their pricing are all good by me. This spatula has not let me down."
"Sure, you can get by without a spatula made especially for fish fillets, but why would you when this one is so inexpensive yet so well made, including the beveled edge to get up under and gently lift a delicate fillet and any excess oil drains off through the slots. Plus, it‚Äôs stainless steel, not plastic, sturdy yet flexible. And it‚Äôll work just fine for use as a regular spatula!"
Super sleek and non stick! Loved cooking and grilling with this spatula! Amazing how easy it was to clean! Definitely recommend!
"The price was definitely worth it! My husband does the cooking, and his utensils were literally melting on the edges. They were so hard to get clean. Since I do the cleaning, I just couldn't stand it any more. After reading reviews and careful consideration, I chose these utensils. I think they will serve my husband well for years to come!"
Like the versatility in using with nonstick pots & pans. Very sturdy over previous ones I owned. Dishwasher safe and they don‚Äôt curl up from the heat of the pans or skillets
Started using cast iron pans and needed something to withstand the high heat. These are very sturdy and just what I needed‚Ä¶
"These are sturdy spatulas, can flip an egg easy, clean up easy. I put them in my dishwasher"
These spatulas are well made and work well. I got them specifically for my groovy new ceramic pans and they do not disappoint!
Perfect selection of spatulas. Sturdy and easy to clean.
Items are as advertised and are just what I was looking for. Well made and easy to clean.
"I love the variety with getting 3 together! Love the wide width of the slotted widest one! Should be great for turning a fried egg, usually not wide enough, Father‚Äôs Day gift, and I expect they will b great!"
these are great they don't get hot and work great easy to clean
I love my spatulas! I have someone with memory issues who melted my old ones. Love them!
Sturdy
I love these. All the perfect sizes
With non stick pan. Work great
good
Thin edges let you turn around easy anything on your pan. Excellent set.
Would definitely recommend this set
These work. After buying several nonstick utensils (that melted in my frying pans) I finally read the fine print. These are good for cooking the rest melt at boiling water temperature. Obvious frauds
"Should have bought these a long time ago. Very nice, well made."
Good quality and price was very good.
"Super strong, easy to clean. Nothing sticks."
"Such an awesome tool, great quality, true to the heat resistance."
Good
I love all three pieces. Smooth in my Pots and Pans.
Nice heavy duty set of spatulas.
Worth the money.
It does what I expect
"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll last and they definitely do the job. But the silicon wasn‚Äôt refined/trimmed on my egg spatula and I had to peel off the excess leaving little rubber pieces on my table. Not a big deal because now that I‚Äôve done that, I probably don‚Äôt need to worry about it, but it is a quality control thing."
I like everything about them when using them. What I don't like so much is when I put them in dishwasher they always come out spotted. I just hand wash now.
Quality is fair. You get what you pay for. I wish the company would produce better quality ones and I would love to pay more for better ones.
Have had these for about 2 months and they are not holding up well. One is torn. Several have a buildup that is hard to clean off. I have much older spatulas that are in better shape.
Product worked well enough initially but once it came out of the dishwasher they were discolored and covered in soap marks that will not come off. The spatulas are fine for what they are but don‚Äôt false advertise them as dishwasher safe.
When they came out of the dishwasher they were discolored and covered in soap marks that will not come off. The spatulas are fine for what they are but don‚Äôt false advertise them as dishwasher safe.
"Having, for DECADES, purchased from major chain store, my cooking utensils. I decided to try these. even on an older pan, boy those eggs came off almost effortlessly. I say Almost, because it's an old pan, I may be up for a new cookware set. These turners are lovely, they are sturdy! and nothing sticks to silicone, except silicone! food sure doesn't!! ( and yes these have a metal core in them, but you can feel that it spreads out within the paddle, so there will be no slipping off. ( like some of those cake bowl spatulas) I really like these."
"I've not had ANY food stick to them at all! The larger oval one can defeat ANY pancake. The longer one can handle a long fish fillet without tearing it up. The fillet is beautiful when plated for the table. The smaller, more normal sized and shaped one, is the one I use the most, and it's just right. This set will become my go-to housewarming present in the future. I'm the practical sort."
"These are very nice significant quality, they are not flimsy, I have been waiting for them to come in stock."
Happy with my Silicone Spatulas Set for Nonstick Cookware works great
Easy to use
"this is huge!!! just what i was looking for in scale and shape , decent price, fast ship! thank you!!"
"Bought this to replace a similar tool which had broken. Handy size, good grip, silicone spatula end, ideal for picking food up that's smaller sized or for turning oven chips to give a consistent colour. If you want to pick up breaded fish or items of that size then you should get a wider item."
"Well made, arrived in good condition and all three work well."
I wanted good metal spatulas with wood handles and these are really nice.
Love the rounded edge on the spatula. It fits against the side of round skillets. No more chasing those last bits of food around the pan.
like this set
Happy with my purchase.
I was very happy with how well made they were.
I bought this to go with my wok And turns out I‚Äôm gonna have to buy a different wok But this sat was a good deal and it does work very well I don‚Äôt cook fish but if you do that one utensil and there would be great for flipping fish beyond that it is a great set very sturdy and definitely worth the money
"I am disappointed with this set of cooking utensils. After only a few washes, they have developed several rust spots."
It‚Äôs cheap plastic. Metal looks cheap. I wanted to return them the moment I got them.
"Very nice set here. Looks great with the wood handle. I probably wouldn't put them in the dishwasher, that way they would last longer. The metal is nice and strong under normal use. Easy to clean. Love the rounded spatula."
Good for cast iron pans
Stamped metal very cheap!
After first two uses the handles are wobbly.
great tools at reasonable price
Love 'em.
They were beautiful. I was disappointed on the quality. I thought they would be solid handles not pressed stainless steel handles with no backing and hollow. üòï Not commercial grade or high quality as mentioned. Pressed handles.
Very very weak. You get what you pay for
"They're cheap, and bend easy. Waste of money."
"They appear to be very well made, an excellent gift."
All stainless steel
I love these new tools in my kitchen however they are very flimsy and bend very easily.
"Very happy with this purchase, quality is much better than I anticipated."
This set arrived with no delay.Looks nice and very sturdy.
Skillets
After many trials and errors we finally found our perfect spatula at a reasonable price.üëç
This set is perfect for my metal pots and pans!!! I love them. They feel great in my hand. Not too heavy but very sturdy!
"...but in a good way.  I ordered this spatula as the Oxo brand always seems to be highly rated on America Test Kitchen. This one does not disappoint. Here is what I like about it: 1) Single piece construction: no nooks or crannies for food and debris to get trapped in and is easy to clean. Has embedded stiffener in handle so tool feels sturdy, without being ""floppy"". 2) Made of silicone: no worries about melting the tool. 3) Spatula head: nicely sculpted, with tapering edges all around, allowing you to get into all the corners of whatever bowl or pan you are using it on. Stiffener of handle runs about half way through spatula head, giving it some stiffness, while having the end and edges being just silicone, providing flexibility where it is needed. 4) Handle: handle is long, about 9.5"" long, (overall spatula is about 15"" long). At first, I thought this would be too long and unwieldly, but after using it for a bit, I actually find it useful as I get better leverage when stirring more viscous things or needing some extra distance from a hot frying pan or being able to reach the bottom of a deep pot. That said, this is not for delicate, precision work, more of a work horse tool.  Final analysis: I would recommend this spatula to friends and family so it get's 5-stars."
"This spatula is awesome! No, really, it is! I use it to get the last contents out of containers (not cans, I don't want to cut the silicone on the edge the can), mix things, flip my panini type sandwiches in my George Foreman Grill and to scrape melted cheese off, I also use it to remove charred bits when I cook a steak or burgers before they cool and harden. No melting, no muss, no fuss! Knock wood, I haven't had any issues with the metal poking out, but I've only had it for a few months. I will definitely update my review if the problem develops."
Is it a spatula? Is it a spoon? It‚Äôs my go to cooking tool. it is versatile and safe for all my pots and pans. A must have in my kitchen.
""
"I saw other review saying this is too sturdy, so I got it for soap making. It really is perfect. The tip of spatula is still soft enough but i dont have to worry about silicon splitting like food spatula silicon. If you are to work or make something that's thick sauce or paste, I would definitely recommand."
"I bought this for my wife as a random present since I noticed her current spatulas were cumbersome to use when she was only cooking for two. It's been a few months and she loves it! I've used it myself and while it's not good for using for, say a wok, it's good when you're just pan frying a small egg or scraping off the last of the batter."
Easy to use and clean. Most of the spade is firm. Just the edges are flexible. That is different from grocery store spatulas where most of the spade is flexible.
"I had the old OXO 3 piece set, but eventually the connection gets gunky and it falls apart. The smallest one died years ago. This one-piece tool is the perfect rubber spatula. I've used it for everything from saut√©ing veggies to scraping down a baking bowl, to mixing a tough as nails, low hydration dough. Its great."
"Love it. Sturdy, durable and does not come apart. It performs well and it‚Äôll last a very long time."
Great for a non stick pan! Flexible which makes it easy to get every angle in any pot or pan
It can reach the bottom of bowl without messing my hands! Good that it comes in different sizes! I would love to get different sizes now!
I used it for cooking my 10 month old daughter‚Äôs meal. Good quality and easy to clear.
This spatula is a little sturdier than some others I have. I like that for some things. I also like that the handle is silicone and not wooden.
Amazing!! I use it for a sourdough starter.
"I use this spatula every day. It is easy to handle. It gets in to small spaces and it scrapes food well. I can use it on a very hot surface or rest it on a hot pan for a short time and not having to worry about the damage from heat. Overall, it performs as expected. Great product."
"Use daily, spreading jam on toast. Not tested for heat resistance."
works great with sourdough
Goo tool in the kitchen
Excellent structure with a bit of flex at the tip.
Sturdy little spatula. Easy to clean and fits into small-sized jars and bottles.
Sometimes you just need a slender long stiff spatula. This is it
Flexible blade and very sturdy. LOVE this for scraping thick batter and dough from bowls
It‚Äôs a fantastic spatula. Great size (biggest one I have by far). Very sturdy and a little flexible. Really can‚Äôt say enough good things.
Great spatula. Mostly use it to cook eggs and saut√© stuff. Highlh recommend.
I love this spatula. I think it's better than the OXO jar spatula. It's slightly wider than the Jar spatula and has the right sturdiness / flexibility.
"We purchased four of these, we love them so much. They're fantastic for cooking and getting food out of jars. Love!"
This is the perfect spatula. Very study and the heat resistance is amazing. I use it everyday and easy to clean too!
I like the length (it‚Äôs long) and it‚Äôs pretty sturdy without being stiff. Overall good product and good buy. Recommended
I‚Äôve used this for over a month. Scrambled eggs. Heated and thawed frozen soup. Stir fried vegetables. All good.
I'm really glad I bought this. It's very useful and easy to clean.
This has quickly become my favorite spatula. Seems like it will last a while.
"No silly separating parts, no hard-to-clean crevices, pretty durable so far after ~5mo use. Shape is fine albeit a bit too angular than I'd ideally like to see, but it's definitely one of the best options"
Nothing to dislike
"easy to clean, sturdy and oxo makes a quality product"
It is a plainly good spatula. OXO is a brand I very much love overall.
"Well after using this I find it to be beyond sturdy and lacks flexibility. Around the flat paddle end of the spatula, only about 1/4 inch of its outer edge is flexible, and does not fit any conure of jars or bowls. In my opinion, I would be better served using a wooden spoon. I really am not pleased with the stiffness of this and for what it is, I think I paid too much! I would not buy again, nor would I recommend it."
Works great!
"I bought this Oxo silicone spatula to use in a bread making machine. I returned it since it is stubby and like a hard stick. It has almost NO flexibility. I use another Oxo small silicone spatula that is flexible and much better than this model. I recommend not buying it. If you are thinking of buying it for cleaning out the inside of narrow jars, Oxo sells another model that flexible and a much better shape for that."
"maybe this is meant for commercial use or someone bigger and stronger than me - it‚Äôs very heavy, handle is large and uncomfortable in your hand- great for someone like shaq or tyrus!!"
Sent it back. Could barely scrape a bowl let alone a jar. Has very little flexible edge. I'm sure it will last for years but this barely meets the definition of spatula.
It‚Äôs ok. Not as flexible as I‚Äôd like and so done often use it.
It's a sturdy tool definitely more spatula than spoon the spoon part is very shallow and is not going to hold more than a teaspoon of liquid if you're trying to use it in any sort of serving capacity While not scratching your precious non stick surfaces.
A piece of the spatula at the tip chipped off when we were stirring food in a pot...
"This silicone jar spatula is the perfect tool for the job. I had bought a narrow, flexible spatula from the dollar store that looked like the perfect tool - 5"" of soft, flexible silicone. That thing gets into every crevice of a jar, but it doesn't hold the mayonnaise or jelly - as it un-flexes that tool drops whatever it just grabbed onto. This Oxo spatula does what it claims. Narrow enough to get into a jar, flexible on the edges to grasp the mayo, but rigid enough to hold it as you remove it from the jar. Not to mention it is just a useful, small spatula for other spatula-related kitchen uses."
"We've bought a ton of OXO kitchen accessories, and have never been disappointed. This is no exception. I was looking for a full size spatula (to replace a non-OXO one that broke in half), so this wasn't exactly it, but it has turned out to be one extremely useful kitchen tool! I have some very small spatulas (spatulae?) that I use with small jars or small pans, and this is great for that but so much more. It's sturdier than the small ones, and has a longer handle. It can fit into small spaces but is also strong enough to scrape cookie batter off the edges of a bowl. In fact the small size helps it fit into the beaters too. It's kind of a hybrid between a tiny jar spatula & a full size one, and I use it all the time!"
"OXO Good Grips Silicone Jar Spatula - Oat  My sole purpose for getting this was to get as much out of jars of things like peanut butter and mayonnaise as I could and I have to say that it works very well. It's definitely helping me to reduce the amount of food I waste. It's easy to clean, too. I just toss it into the dishwasher and it comes out nice and clean.  This is the perfect spatula for cleaning out jars from a company that I have come to trust for cooking utensils."
This is a well made smaller sized silicon spatula. The handle is well sized and the only truly ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù part (if you can call it that) is at the tip where you want it for scraping. I reach for this when mixing instead of a large tablespoon sized serving spoon. It works great and comes out of the dishwasher clean and no worse for the wear.
"I love the bright color of this silicon spoon/spatula! It is pleasing to the eye and nice to hold. The end of it is flexible (like a spatula), but it works great for cooking and stirring. It can be used for cooking and stirfries -- You'll see in the photo that I used it while making my scrambled tofu.  It is also good for things like stirring batter. My opinion is that it isn't quite flexible enough for things like getting peanut butter out of the bottom of a jar. It is a little flexible, but it is more solid. I love having this in my kitchen tool repertoire!"
"OXO is usually my go-to brand when I need a new kitchen utensil/gadget. I have a few other OXO spatulas and they work well and come with the most important feature of a spatula, after their ability to scrape the sides of containers: only being one piece and no nooks & crannies for food to get stuck in! The other cheapo spatulas I had before I found this style had detachable heads and the interior always got food stuck in it and were impossible to clean.  I will mention that I have noticed the other OXO spatulas I have ended up with a couple of tiny pieces missing; not sure if they got caught on something or what, and I guess we just have to hope it didn't fall in the food.  I will try to update my review if I notice any durability issues or any other pros/cons."
"This is an excellent silicone spatula for big jobs! If you are constantly feeling like your regular spatula just isn't up to the task, this is what you need! Whether it's digging deep into large jars or stirring up a big pot of dinner in a nonstick pot or pan, this spatula is up for it and will not damage your cookware.  The longer than typical handle also gives you more leverage, so if you have weak wrists, this will give them some relief as well.  It may be silicone, but it is thick material and doesn't bend when you put it to work. Based on my usage, I expect this spatula will be with me for a very long time. Another great product at a great value from OXO, one of the few brands left that doesn't ever let me down. 5 stars!"
"I buy/try a lot of kitchen tools, but not that many of them stand out. This spoon spatula does, for a number of reasons:  1. It's versatile: you can use it like a rubber scraper, you can use it like a spoon (though it's pretty shallow, so temper your spooning expectations). 2. It's firm: If it were too floppy, it would be WAY less useful (I've had a few tools like this...) but, it as a very stiff core, all the way up to the front edge, that allows you to use it with all sorts of thick/heavy foods. 3. It seems durable: I have a feeling the thickness of the silicone will make it long-lasting (some flippers have too thin of silicone, and it can start to peel off...) 4. Nice size: a little smaller than i expected, which is actually nice. I dislike oversized kitchen utensils...  Overall, I highly recommend you add this spoon spatula to your kitchen; I find myself grabbing it often!"
"One of the real challenges with with silicon utensils is the various ways companies try to get cute with handles or just cheap out. I've had silicon tops with plastic handles that melt if you rest it against anything remotely warm. I've had silicone tops with metal handles that handle heat just fine but they burn your skin off if you touch it. So what do I prefer... one piece solutions like this one, nothing to fall off, melt or get so hot you could cook on that surface too.  I do have a red theme kitchen. it's just a preference though, not a matchie match sort of scenario. I have bright red, cranberry, something something red apple and now... jam. I like this. If someone asks me color it is years from now I'll just say, red.  It's easy to hold for me, no hand issues though, washes fine in the dishwasher, has a sharp enough edge to scrape batter out of a bowl and push around scrambled eggs in a pan. It's very heat resistant, no melting issues so far, and it stays cool enough to touch. I imagine some would prefer a different grip at the end, but like I said above, I'm over handle issues. I like them just like this is! It's a great overall tool to have around."
"Some silicone spoon spatulas are very thin and bendy. Not this one. This stands up to thicker batters, etc. Also handy for scraping the inside of jars. Handy and doesn‚Äôt take up much space.  But that‚Äôs JustMe. (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)"
"A few of the silicone spatulas I've purchased recently have ""bent"" in the middle (like there was a metal piece inside) or have warped in the dishwasher, rendering them useless. This one by OXO has held up to numerous baking tests recently. It hasn't warped or bent with heavy use, and washing in the dishwasher.  It's perfectly shaped to get those last little yums out of the bowl.  I will be buying myself a few more of these (I'm an avid baker and cook), and maybe a few to include in some christmas presents. They are very giftable!"
"Okay, I think I found my favorite spoon! Nope, it‚Äôs a spatula! No, it‚Äôs a spoon! It‚Äôs perfect for reaching into the peanut butter jar, the mayonnaise jar, and even the applesauce!  It has flexible edges that works the greatest when baking! I love being able to slide it along the edge of the bowl and it cleans!  It also works great when cooking! It‚Äôs made of high-heat resistant silicone allows me to use it on my non-stick cookware, doesn‚Äôt scratch and works great!  And the best news is they are dishwasher safe! So easy clean up!"
This Oxo spatula is decent quality. The spatula is a one piece design with flexible edges along the spatula head. It works well for cleanly scraping cake batter from a mixing bowl. The spatula is easy to clean.
"This is an excellent jar spatula ‚Äì it cleans under the rim, etc. really well. The handle is comfortable to grip & it is all one piece so no areas to collect crud. It goes thru the dishwasher fine."
OXO Good Grips Silicone Heavy-duty Spatula ‚Äì Oat  This is a very very good large spatula. It is well molded and has a nice soft edge to do some serious scraping. It is also very solid to work with. I also have used Oxo‚Äôs guarantee a few years ago on one of their pepper grinders. It failed and I called and they were as nice as could be. I had a replacement in a few days. They really stand behind their products. So use this well and feel confident in the quality. It comes in sizes and colors so you can fine tune your selection. It may just be a spatula but it‚Äôs an excellent one.
"This silicone-wrapped spatula has a nylon core. Safe for non-stick cookware, and easy to get into tight corners, this feels solid and is heat resistant. Large enough to get the last bits of cookie dough out of the bowl, yet small enough to get into tight corners. Covered completely in silicone it feels good in your hand, and allows you to get a good grip. Dishwasher safe and useful, and the red color helps keep it non-staining when used with tomato products like sauce."
"OXO's spoon spatula is very nicely made from thick and dense silicone. The red color is lovely and evenly applied. The spatula is sturdy and flex free. It withstands the heat on my gas cooktop easily and I use this spatula to cook oatmeal, rice, and scoop ingredients out of a mixing bowl when baking. It washes perfectly in the top rack of my dishwasher.  All in all... another quality OXO product."
I like this spoonula - I have tried others that were too floppy and others that were too stiff - this seems to strike a good balance - quite flexible on the edges and sturdy enough for stiff mixtures.
"I love a good sturdy spatula and this is it. Strong and firm nearly to the tip, which is soft and pliable. This one won't let you down. Note that it is not the pancake flipping type of spatula, but rather the scraping the big bowl of brownie batter kind of spatula. Very happy with it!"
Everybody needs a silicon spatula (or three) in their kitchen. OXO is a great brand and this spatula is well designed and made as expected.  = Current price of $11 is a good value so 5-STAR rating by me in consideration of price/value.
"I liked the OXO Good Grips silicone spoon-spatula. It's large, and gray. I'm not excited about the color, but this is a very utilitarian tool that meets the expectations that I have for the high quality of OXO kitchen tools. Recommended!"
"This is a nice sturdy spoonula. It's dishwasher-safe. On the larger side, so very practical for cooking family meals. It won't damage non-stick, which is important for us. Heavy duty. Just an excellent quality spoonula."
"This is a super sturdy, heat resistant spatula. Oxo makes great kitchen gadgets and this is no exception. It's dishwasher safe, can withstand high temperatures, good color and quite sturdy. Good value for what you get."
"I got ‚Äúoat‚Äú color, but I did not expect a peachy-pink color spatula. Despite this color situation, the spatula itself is actually very nimble in my tiny kitchen, it‚Äôs perfect to stir soups and cook pasta. I quite like it.  Best of all, it takes minimal space up in the dishwasher and can go on lower rack."
"Nice, well made spatula. Helpful for getting the last 'bits' out of the bottom of the jar.  High heat resistance makes it great for cooking, too."
"Silicone can vary in the feel, and this is too tacky/slimy for me, and the shape is barely an improvement over a normal spatula or long spoon. If you often need to get materials out of narrow-mouth jars, this might be good, but otherwise, it's a waste of space."
I am 77 yo and have baked a lot in my life. This spatula is the best cookie making tool I have ever found. Small enough to clean out jars and large enough to quickly scrape down mixing bowl. I am so glad to have found this tool.
"After breaking our last spatula's handles and saving the removable tops (which only works for small bowls, not jars!) I saw these seemless ones and thought I'd give them a try... and LOVE them! They're sturdy, with what feels like metal up the middle, and then the silicon is perfectly flexible to get all the goodies out of the nooks and crannies of jars. Definitely works great, especially for the price. I love not having to take the tops off to get the food out of it, cleans easily."
"No complaints; the material is a nice texture and easy to hold, the inside handle seems more than sturdy enough that I'm not worried when using them, and they're very satisfying to use. Genuinely fantastic quality!"
I was about to run the dishwasher when I recived my order so I threw them in there. I bought the black set and when they finished washing they were a spotted gray. After a few hand washes with dish soap and a scrub it did return back to black . I would just avoid having to go through that lol over all I love them! They are great!
"I love using these silicon kitchen utensils because, they are easy to use with hot things, plus elders have a hard time gripping and sometimes the bigger utensils are hard to hold while cooking, they get in my way, as these are light weight and easy to hold."
"Exactly what I was looking for! I needed a spatula that was flexible enough to scrape the sides of a bowl and sturdy enough to use when cooking. Excellent variety of sizes, comfortable to hold, easy to care for."
"so happy with this purchase, didn't know how much i needed each of these until i purchased the set. quality is good as well for the price."
These are perfect!!! I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect since I needed silicone spatulas but thought these were cheap. I love them. Absolutely worth it.
These work great and clean up like a dream. The different sizes are perfect and they are very durable.
I like my new spatulas! They work great! Thank you Amazon and Seller!  Gina Noel
Item as described. Does not have a weird smell that I fear it would. Looks sturdy.
I love how they are easy to clean and I do not have to worry about them melting.
I use them every day when I cook since they don‚Äôt scratch the pan. Very easy to clean and super convenient to use!
These work great. Great product for the price. Would purchase again.
As described
Useful product highy recommended
Good all around. Used in light cooking and have thrown it in the dishwasher. No issues. Handle is sturdy enough to hold up to heavy stirring.
"Just as described, good quality."
Good quality product for the price.
Real good set and value
"Durable, silicone spatula set. These are well made and a great buy for the price! Easy to use and clean up well. 5 stars."
Great spatulas for the price. Easy to clean and soils design.
"Very sturdy, easy clean, works amazingly!! 10/10 recommend!! That price is too nice for the variety pack!"
Awesome product. Happy I ordered it
Awesome set.
Love these for small jars & bottles
"These spatulas work beautifully, and I love the look of them."
Good size and seem to be durable.
Nice and clean
Love this set of spatulas. Great price and good quality
Love!! Can‚Äôt beat the price and quality
"Love these spatulas. Great sizes, easy to clean, scrape incredibly and handle the heat of kettles! Quite pleased!"
Very useful for handling baked goods.
Easy to clean
"This spatula set is wonderful. They are sturdy. Due to the very hard water in my home, when they are cleaned they show the hard water, so for me this is the only disadvantage. My other cooking utensils are store in suspended containers from IKEA, but I don't want to show off the hard water, so I store these in the drawer next to our butter knives. I might buy these again though, because my family uses them multiple times a day."
"These come as close as I have ever imagined for a food-safe, easily cleanable, supple enough to confirm and scrape yet sturdy enough to speead, durable and we'll shaped to get the last gram of whatever out of jars, bowls, cans and pans. I could wish they would design the same thing in even smaller sizes with the same properties for getting stuff out of even smaller containers."
"I got these by miss clicking while looking for oxo silicone spatulas. The oxo ones look great after getting cleaned, these get some weird whiteish film that I don't trust (might be fine, I have no idea it just isn't a good look)"
"They are smaller than I expected, but that's not a bad thing! They fit in small jars better as a result. I wish the stainless steel reinforcement went further up inside the handles. The very ends of the handles are a little too flexible for my big hands. (XL glove size)"
"Small - reminded me of a ""Junior's first kitchen"" set you might see at Toys R Us.  Can't imagine flipping an omelette or a big burger with one of these would be very fun."
"I've had these for 3 weeks, but I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week so these silicone spatulas have gotten a lot of use. They're the best I've had for scraping bowls and jars. A few people complain that they broke while mixing, but I think those people need ""industrial strength"" utensils for their mixing needs. For everyday average use, these are great."
My husband ordered this set for me because the heads of my plastic spatulas kept falling off i to whatever food i was trying to work with. I LOVE this set! The sizes and shapes are perfect for different needs.
I returned it. I should have looked at the description and the picture more carefully before I ordered it. I didn't use them or take them out of the sleeves.
These are not too bad. They are just really floppy as you get to the end of the spatula.  I prefer a stiffer end to mix with.  Decent price though
Very easy to clean and feels fantastic in your hands. An absolute must have
"False details on site,"
Spatula broke 10 days after return period ended. Useless for intended purpose now.
"Purchased these based on the good reviews; however, they are pretty mediocre. Immediately I noticed that they handles are only semi-reinforced with a hard piece of wood/plastic, leaving both ends of the spatula WAY too flexible. This makes it difficult to handle since the handle of the spatula bends and twists in your hand.  Additionally, the spatulas are so flimsy that a moderate amount of pressure on the ends encourages the reinforcement to pierce through the silicone!  Ultimately, they are pretty much junk. I doubt they'll last long, which is pretty discouraging considering this was a $9 set of spatulas."
"Maybe not the best, but they are easy to clean, seem to be hold up well, and are adequate for my purposes. The price made it a 5 star."
Great
"I like the material, all items are substantial when held in your hand, works as expected. In my opinion, they are ALL about an inch or two short. Spoon is not long enough while cooking to keep your hand away from the heat, ""blade"" too short for an average peanut butter jar, same for the jelly spatula. All 4 could use a little extra length."
finally a spatula that doesn't come apart or melt I love it
"I‚Äôm so pleased with these utensils! Gets the very last bit of mayo, peanut butter, jelly, etc! No waste!"
The spatula is sturdy. What i like most is the tip which is pliable and good for scrapping. Can withstand high heat. Am dont regret buying. Love it!
"This has a metal rod through the middle, is not solid on its own like food network. I know this because I was scraping the side of my bowl making scones, which I've done a dozen times with various silicone scrapers, and the metal poked through. Very disappointed, wish it lasted longer than it did. It was nice having a matching set with various sizes"
"sometimes you get what you pay for. This is certainly the case with these. They are OK and I did keep them, but I've had them for 2 months now and have not used once. They've been pushed to the back of the drawer now and will probably only use when nothing else is clean. :)"
As described. They work great.
"Not as sturdy as two-piece spatulas with stiff handles, making it less effective for scraping out last contents of jars."
Too small in my opinion.
I love them except for the fact that putting them in a dishwasher turns them kind of white.
"I have used this once, and it is already broken. This was a waste of money for a product that is severely lacking in its basic usability. This was used to make cookies. It was a one and done, the steal handle has broken out of the silicon. There is no sturdiness in this spatula set and it lasted 1 use not even through mixing down soft cookie dough."
"I washed all items in the dishwasher as soon as I received them. I ordered the black ones, just after the first wash they lost their color, now they are ugly black and gray."
"Liked these at first but very quickly the plastic inside began ripping through starting with the spoon, but also happening to two of the spatulas. Unfortunately not durable or sturdy"
One of the spatulas broke after one month of use. All spatulas were hand washed and used for light residential cooking. The spatulas are pretty flimsy as well. Purchased them because they were one piece for ease of cleaning. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
I haven‚Äôt used this more than 3 times and the large spatula already has a tear in it. Garbage. Do not buy!
Look great but.... the inner metal(?) piece started to break through on the wide end on the ones we used the most (small and medium ones) ...noticed after a week and a half or so. They do look damn good though...I‚Äôll give them that.
This was a wedding gift but I purchased these previously for myself and have loved them.
"I really like these! When I first washed them in the dishwasher they had a white film. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be as bad now with continued use and washing. I like that they are all one solid piece. I really like the biggest spatula, works great. I don‚Äôt care for the long skinny one but that‚Äôs personal preference"
I used this for baking. Sizes were just what I needed. Worked well in getting batter out of bowls. Can't comment on durability because I've only used one of the spatulas once. But I'm glad I bought this set.
"I find myself using at least one of these every time I cook since I got them. I'm not big on gadgets; just give me a few simple, versatile tools like these & I'm a happy cook."
"These are of a very nice quality,work well and look nice"
I like the variety I got and the color and they feel pretty sturdy.
Sturdier than expected so this increased its value sense.
I am happy with my purchase because they are heat resistant. I had a medal spatula before and it got hot when I accidentally left it in the pan after cooking. I don't have that problem anymore.
They are very nice. A bit flimsy but overall good.
"Work as expected. I was unable to apply the pinch test because they are too stiff, but they ""feel"" like silicon."
Excellent. Will buy again.
very good
I love this set and will get them again.
Good quality.
Love these for use with nonstick cookware.
used a few times and seems good.
Good
These spatulas were exactly what I was looking for. Great quality.
It works for me.
"Love it! Great design, really non-stick and fit perfectly with my big round pan! Highly recommended"
I love them just what I was looking for thanks üòä
Fabulous
You get 2 spatulas. The non-metal spatula broke because the design is off where the base meets the handle. You will immediately see this. When it broke you can see the material is silicone over some type of plastic. Beautiful red disappointment and could have been dangerous had I used it on stove instead of George Foreman grill.
"I love the long, flat spatula in this set, which is perfect for pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, omelettes and a ton of other flipping uses. I'm less thrilled with the smaller perforated one. While it will never scratch a no-stick pan, it has a tough time doing simple stuff like breaking up ground beef clumps or stir-frying meat or veggies by sliding firmly across the bottom of the pan or wok. There is such a thing as too flexible and with too fat a front edge. I do love that these are silicone and not plastic."
"I bought these to replace my old plastic ones. I like that these are cheaply priced for being silicone. However, the flipper is too large and won‚Äôt hold a lot of weight. Idk what I would use it for, maybe only pancakes. It‚Äôs bigger than expected. However, I will admit I didn‚Äôt measure before buying. But who needs one that big?? I can see myself using the slotted one quite a bit. It‚Äôs a good size."
The large turner is poorly made. It is too big to support any weight. It flexes a lot.
Does what it is supposed to do. Just seems to leave watermarks and the like very easily. That's the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 5. I've never had any other kitchen utensils that have been so difficult to make stainless.
Works great. Easy to clean. No problem with high heat. We've used with fish and shrimp in hot skillets or with eggs or pancakes. Recommended. Would buy again.
"The large spatula measures 6"" long and 4"" wide. It is too large for most frying pans. The smaller one was great."
The smaller one is my go-to spatula for non stick pans. The big one is good for pancakes
The big turner is nearly too big for the frying pan and the smaller one is just about too thick too be functional.
Bought this for my fianc√©. Did not even make it through one full use as it broke as soon as it was put to use. Will not buy anything of this brand ever again.
great quality and very sturdy
The end of the large turner began to break into tiny bits as I tried to remove a flat bread from a cookie sheet. It was not particularly hot or a very difficult task. The cookie sheet and bread had tiny red shavings all over.
"Seems good, but the smaller one is a little to thick."
look best when hand washed
Smaller one broke over my kids butt. Would recommend only using on a pan!
"Aside from pancakes, I don't know what I would use the larger spatula for. I now know that I don't care for silicone spatulas and the return window is very small."
Very sturdy and hefty!
"For some reason, food gets stuck to the spatula, I have to spray with Pam before using. Very sturdy. The grip is good."
"They are perfect, just what i wanted, and needed."
Nice good value
These are nice quality spatulas. I had cheaper ones I was using and just did not like them. These are good sized and work well.
These are great.
Spatulas are good overall. A little on the thick side like most silicone spatulas.
Love these
I like the spatulas One is quite large but! still useful
Little and big sturdy spatulas!
Okay...but on the LARGE size.
I would consider these items flimsy not flexible.
We were excited to receive these and then after the first use making pancakes this one cracked. :(
"Love these best I have ever had,easy to clean."
"No problem with the implements themselves, just they were just way bigger than I expected. Not what I had in mind.... and I especially searched for the smallest ones I could find! oh well. I can use the smaller one sometimes..."
"Do not put in dishwasher, not even on the tippy top rack meant for small delicate items. 1st wash on the top rack, slotted spatula came out with that odd white/gray coating."
fried eggs. Sturdiness
"I have only used the slotted spatula so far, but the angle of it is different than most and it seems harder to get things out of a small pan."
Not dishwasher safe.. Warped after first time washing on top rack.
Great value for the price! Easily releases food and is true non-stick.
Good product
Wash nicely
These seem to be sturdy but I bought them because it said it was flexible and they are pretty rigid hence the reason for only 3 stars
Good
Not sure how long this long spatula will last. Feels like it‚Äôs going to fall apart.
"Bought these 11 months ago, use them both a few times a week. The bigger one is already falling apart."
Does not wash well. Also not very sturdy.
FLIPPER HEAD Broke easily. Waste of money.
Wouldn‚Äôt purchase again. I could‚Äôve bought better at Dollar Tree
"I ordered these for my son to take to college to use with his new air fryer and pressure cooker a both appliances have a non stick surface and plastic utensils sometimes still scratch the non stick surface. I prefer silicone utensils now. I used the turners to provide a review. The pancake flipper is very flimsy. A little to much give in the turner, but it works, it can be harder to use because it gives and bends. The smaller turner worked well in my instant pot for sauteing until I had a lot in the pot, then I kept hearing a funny noise. The end of the turner is not all metal or a hard material under the silicone. There is a 1/4 inch of just silicone at the end of the turner, this silicone flip flops back and forth if you are moving stuff around in your pot. It is not the end of the world for $4 a utensil, but I do prefer the turner be completely solid under the entire length of the silicone. Again it makes it easier to get under eggs. But overall for the price these utensils are a good deal. They are not chef quality but they are adequate for the infrequent cook. Best part is they do not scratch your non stick surfaces."
"We have been using our ancient plastic or steel spatulas for way too long. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the issues here; scraped pans or melted flakes of plastic included in every meal. We transitioned to silicone baking gear a while ago, including mixers and mixer/spoon combos, but I think we feared that the silicone spatulas would be a little too flexible to give us the flipping, sliding, and scaping strength we desired.  This simple set has quelled our fears.  The smaller turner is a great and sturdy utility tool, but my real love is the larger spatula. I don‚Äôt have the patience to make a thousand little pancakes, so I make one huge pancake. I‚Äôm trying to be a littler healthier, so I also opt for the super-dense buckwheat variety. The big spatula, with its wide surface area and rigid metal shaft have stood up to the biggest and heaviest pancakes that I‚Äôve thrown at it. And I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that I make huuuge pancakes. Not only doesn‚Äôt it fold or bend under the weight, but it flips like a dream. Now, to be fair, I have had to call in the turner once or twice to complete a flip ‚Äì although it was really more precautionary than necessary ‚Äì but, thankfully, it‚Äôs right there for the using.  For routine pancake makers, and those that are just tired of eating plastic and scraping their pans, I highly recommend this set!"
"I was given the To encounter Silicone Spatula Set Nonstick Rubber Slotted Turner Pancake Flippers for an honest review  For Christmas I purchased a couple of really nice quality nonstick frying pans for making pancakes and eggs. After purchasing them we realized that some of our cooking utensils needed replacing to prevent ruining these nice new pans. I was so happy when I found the Silicone Spatula Set, I figured they would be the perfect thing to use on the new pans and so far, I have been right.  The handles are sturdy and they slide right under what ever we are cooking with no issues (no broken egg yolks yet). I will admit to being a little worried about the smaller Spatula because will I was testing it out, I notice that the very end of the spatula was a bit flexible but it has yet to drop what ever we are cooking. The longer one has been absolutely great in flipping some of those more delicate items that break easily when using a smaller spatula for flipping them (I really don‚Äôt like broken omelets)."
"This spatula set is a good value for the quality of the spatulas.  The spatula with the slats in it, works beautifully, it has the right amount of ""give"" it's able to withstand a reasonably high heat, works good if you have hot oil in the pan- to a certain extent of course.  It has not been warped or anything like that because of the cooking heat/oils/etc.  Easy to clean and maintain.  The second spatula, while it does not work terribly bad, for certain things it has way too much ""bounce"" to it so definitely use that one for certain things.  It works really good for flipping things like French toast or pancakes. It's all a little bit of trial and error.  I've had both of these items and have used them pretty regularly for a few months now, so far so good.  Like I said the only true complaint is the unslotted spatula. It has a little too much ""bounce"" doesn't feel entirely sturdy, but it still works beautifully."
"These seem to be nice solid spatulas. Silicone does have more grip than plastic. I notice it is a little harder to get the spatula under pancakes than with my old plastic one. Not bad, but I noticed. If you are aiming to get rid of plastic around your food these are a good choice, just be aware that they are a little different than what you are used to. If not, you may not be willing to accept the trade off."
"The Silicone Spatula Set is a good, well made set for cooking. They are built to work well with nonstick cooking surfaces, and are a good size to be easily used. The spatulas are flexible, but sturdy enough to lift up the eggs, pancakes, or other food items. I like the fact they are thin enough at the edge to actually get under the food in order to lift without breaking."
"Sturdy very well-made spatula set. It is covered with a good heavy coating of silicone. The dual slit pancake turner is a decent size with a nice size handle to hold onto. The Large spatula has a large head which is great for hamburgers steaks things like that you might want to turn. The handle of it is actually well coated, made sturdy and stiff. If you‚Äôre looking for a simple new dual spatula set then I would recommend this one. I put the Jell-O box in the photo so that you can see that this is the size,this is one of the large Jello packages so it gives you the size of the spatula."
"After destroying two very expensive non-stick pans that claimed to be able to handle metal cooking utensils, I decided it was necessary to take better care by using protected utensils. These are made of silicone, so I'm guessing they can tolerate higher temperatures than nylon ones. I also love that these have metal cores and are stiff for scraping and stirring things around.  The oversized turner is NOT stiff at the edge of the turner, i.e. the end flexes a bit. However, the slotted turner is like a metal turner with silicone poured on it, so the end is stiff. They each have their uses.  For cleaning, toss them in the dishwasher. Yes, there are spots if you don't use a rinse aid, but that's what you get with rubbery/silicone/plastic items - this is not the fault of the product.  These are very well-made. I expect the silicone to wear off over time but am confident enough to get few (perhaps several) happy years with these."
"This silicone spatula set includes a flat spatula and a flat, slotted spatula. My husband and I like the flat edges on the ends because it makes cooking easier by being able to move the food around as needed. The flat edges also help in chopping apart cooking ground beef or diced chicken."
"These are super easy to clean, foods don‚Äôt stick to them. I like that they flex, it helps to get underneath some foods. I appreciate that you get two different sizes in the set."
"Well, I had to replace my last one that I had for years and was skeptical. These are not the same but I don't dislike them. They are easy to clean and look nice. I recommend."
"I was looking for a good spatula for omelets and over easy eggs. The smaller one is perfect. Flexible enough to get under the eggs but sturdy enough to flip them. I know it's made for fish, but works perfectly for ü•ö as well!"
"I didn't need both pieces, but could give the larger to my son for his outdoor cooking. Excxellent quality this spatula!"
These are very nice. Mich better than the plastic ones I used before.
"Excellent quality, nice & flexible."
"Very good quality, well worth the money."
The best spatula of this type I've seen.
I like these because they are thin on the ends so easy to use to turn something over. I didn‚Äôt think I would use the smaller one but actually find it very useful.
"If your just flipping light stuff in the pan, maybe! If you need to ‚Äúmore often than not‚Äù Stir food in a frying pan forget it way, way to flexible. So it‚Äôs a single use tool if you can afford the space."
"I bought these spatulas to protect my non-stick cookware that I plan to buy in the future. I have not been very diligent in the past and as a result have had to replace my non-stick pans more often than I would like. I fully expect my new spatulas to do the job they were designed to do,"
Better than anticipated. The whole household loves these. The sizes are perfect for getting around different pans and under and around different foods that need to be flipped.
This spatula has slots so you have to make sure you clean between them. But that is expected. It is a little bit flexible which I like very much.
These spatulas work great. Feel sturdy and easily flip cumbersome items
When I was looking at the spatulas they seemed much smaller. They are rather awkward to use when they are so big.
Great quality and very easy to clean. I love being able to put it in the dishwasher.
My husband has been using them in cooking in the frypan. He says they work very well. I find them easy to clean.
Very nice!
Lasted 70 days the silicone started to shred
Fantastic product heat resistance is wonderful the best of ever used
I gave it a 4 star review because it is so 'non-stick' that my fried eggs don't stick to the spatula and it is hard to flip the eggs (keep sliding off). But works well for other items.
These are nice but are not very strong
The small one is usable but the large one is way to flimsy. You could not pick up a salmon filet with this utensil.
Too long for use in smaller skillets.
i‚Äôve only had these spatulas for a few weeks now and they‚Äôve only been in the dishwasher twice maybe? and the rubber is splitting apart and revealing the metal inside already. not cool guys.
"After removing from dishwasher there were white spots that I couldn‚Äôt get off. The spatula part is not hard, and flexes when trying to chop up items in pan."
"They just came. I am surprised to see the quality, the size, the fit. Nothing cheap at all about these! I can't wait to cook with them. They look and feel so much higher in quality than I have ever owned or used before. I will be back after I use them. I have a feeling I will be super recommending them to you. :) (Because, so far, I am in love.)"
"I like to have a smaller spatula with just the right angle in it for flipping eggs, etc. This one fills the bill. Works great and easy to clean. Haven't used the larger one yet but I'm sure I will soon."
"Well flexible without being wimpy, 2 sizes are great. Use on eggs, bacon, sandwiches, fish, crepes. Very nice."
"Maybe a little heavy, but, otherwise fine."
It is a more bendy than I wanted but works well
Great product
"Easy to clean, heat resistant."
The small one is really good- it‚Äôs sturdy and very convenient to use. But the tall/big one is subpar. It‚Äôs not sturdy and bends easily if you put a little pressure on it!!
"Received 2 spatulas in April, by May the metal has cut through the end of the smaller one. I don't cook much so they have not been used often. There was a bump in the silicone close to the area that is ripped open which may be the cause of the metal interior popping through but unknown for sure."
They are good quality and work well . Wife likes the larger one for flipping omelets
"I liked the look of this spatula but the metal right before the silicone flipper and the silicone end itself bend down toward the frying pan and the eggs slide right off before you're able to flip them. No matter which one I used, or how forcefully I slid the spatula under the eggs, it was the same problem. They fall off sideways or frontwise in mid-flip, when trying to do easy-over, breaking the yokes. TLDR: Too bendy to be of any use."
Je les aime bien mais elles sont un petit peu trop √©paisses ... mais elles fonctionnent tout de m√™me bien ...
Bin sehr zufrieden.
"The metal frame is not long enough inside the silicone area, and caused the spatula is not sturdy enough. if I use it as a flipper for fried egg or pancake, then it's a good one, because I can push down the spatula to make it more flat closer to the frypan to flip the pancake easier. However, I bought this one for stir fry, which is not strong enough to stir food when I was doing the cooking. I have use more effort to stir the food. therefore I will give below average for this product."
"If you want a thicker wooden spoon - this is NOT for you!!! But I had one for years that I really liked and was having trouble finding a similar spoon anywhere. This is a THIN spoon, but I use it so often for stirring large pots of sauce and when cooking in non-stick cookware. Hoping they hold up as well as my OLD spoon and so far, they seem to be doing the job! And the price!!!!! Figured I'd better order a couple more before they sell out never to return again!"
I have been trying to replace all of my plastic cooking utensils with bamboo wooden ones because it‚Äôs safer for cooking. I love this spatula! It‚Äôs just about 12‚Äù long so it‚Äôs a good size. It‚Äôs a great price too! I have a few other bamboo utensils and this matches them perfectly. I love cooking scrambled eggs with it!
"At first glance I thought it flimsy. To my surprise this thin-tipped spatula is a silent workhorse. I use it for wok cooking, but also for sauteing veggies in enameled cookware. It wont scratch. It's quiet, lightweight and easy to clean. I love it."
"I purchased these for my husband as we had a wooden spatula that was wearing out. He likes these and uses them frequently. His only area of disappointment was he would prefer the ends to be thinner. Otherwise, I consider this a perfect find."
"It is a sturdy spatula but it‚Äôs scary washing it, I feel like I am going to get splinters because it is fraying so much. Not the best quality"
"The product is untreated bamboo as far as I can tell. after a few uses, it was stained and hard to clean."
He loves them.
Love it for my stir Frys.
The bamboo is not coated and is rough even before the first use.
This spatula has met my expectations.
"I do like the simplicity of this design. It's a basic, well-designed and effective kitchen tool. It is efficient in a wok, it's slim enough to get under fish and flip it nicely (it could be a bit longer, but it works), and it's made of a renewable resource. There's really nothing to dislike about it and it's my opinion that this is a tool that should be in even the most basic of kitchens. Both beginner and expert cooks will find themselves reaching for this on a routine basis. I like it and recommend it."
"I love my wooden spoons and really like the bamboo spatula. It's light and just as you would imagine. I like using it for all sorts of purposes, but do feel like it doesn't soak in water or moisture as some wooden spoons do. So far, works great!"
"I love this spatula. Why, you might ask? It's a spatula. Well, because it has a flat bottom. That's perfect for deglazing a pan. Why more spatulas don't have a flat bottom is beyond me, but this is fantastic. Highly recommended."
This spatula has thicker tip than I would like. It looks unfinished.
These are super thin and definitely won't last long!
"These spatulas are great for general use as well as with non-stick pans. I prefer them to the black plastic spatulas that we have been using for non-stick pans. They are a little thicker than most spatulas and they are not my first choice for flipping eggs, but they are great for deglazing."
Excellent
Easy to clean and well made
"I have been looking for one of these, and here it is. My other one was a wooden one and bigger, but I am happy with it."
