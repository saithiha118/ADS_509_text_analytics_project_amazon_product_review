Just opened the cups and they are dirty! The plastic packaging was not penetrated so I am not sure what could it be. Looks like vomit to me. I am so upset!!!
"I bought these for a graduation party last summer. They worked well for what I needed them for. They were surprisingly durable for a plastic cup, and didn't smash easily with little hands gripping them. The price was right, and I wouldn't have an issue purchasing the Amazon brand of plastic cups in the future (in fact, I have two and a half more years until another graduation and I probably WILL do just that!)"
Few of the cups arrived stuck together and I ended up breaking 4 cups from the first sleeve I opened. Not the same quality as the ones from Costco...you get the same amount of better quality cups for $7 less at Costco. Will not be buying again.
I typically buy Solo cups but decided to give these a try and I'm glad I did. Such a good value and I cannot tell any difference between these and the Solo.
I cannot contain my excitement about these little containers. The liquid I wished to contain remained contained in this container.
"**I purchased the disposable red plastic cups, not the translucent ones. My review is intended for the red cups. This is the product link on my purchase, so if it's the exact same cup, my review holds. Otherwise, this may have been an issue with the product getting switched after I reviewed it.**  Nice, sturdy cups. Had no issues."
"So long Solo! Hello Amazon! I go through many cups per year. It becomes quite expensive. Not no more! These cups blow the Solo cups out of the water! Better cup, better durability and, best of all, better price! Thanks Amazon! Keep up the good work!"
"Looking to capitalize on your jello-shot moxie? The are perfect..cups are Saturday, lids fit well and you can make 16 shots out of one pack of jello...so this is an excellent value! Don’t wait until you have the idea to make shots for the weekend on a Thursday...order them NOW!"
"Great job holding beverages. The beat at being red and, somewhat cylindrical- when looking for something to hold a beverage which can later be recycled this is the item for you! Well done!"
Highly recommend as they are way cheaper then any store. And they do as they are intended
"I love these cups. I use them for every day in my house. We also was and reuse sometimes. I am glad Amazon brought them back. I believe they are a little less thick, but they are still a great cup."
We order these cups all the time from our grocery store. This quantity and price made it cost effective to order from Amazon. We are glad to have this option.
Nice size and very sturdy. Nice being able to buy the large quantity.
"Solid quality. No different than the big named brands. Good for everyday use, parties and beer pong. Occasionally you might find something on sale in store slightly cheaper but that's rare. Good deal overall"
Bought these Christmas party. Great quality
Love them 3rd time buying these worth the money
Looks Good and a Great price. Very Durable.
Who doesn't love the fact that you can let your kids refresh thereselves and not leave you a sink full of glasses. So glad I found these in bulk very sturdy and very helpful. Especially for my big family. Highly recommended
In The second order the cups seemed cheaper and really stick together and I think slightly smaller. Not near as nice!!
Big Red cups. The most versatile cup around. We have hundreds of these we use for everything from drinking to mixing paint.
Comes in master box to protect during shipping. Large 16oz cups. Durable. Comparable to other more expensive brands.
"I'm using these cups for seedlings when they come out of the starter trays. Fairly easy to cut a drain vent in the bottom. They have been handled a lot, no damage to cups. I'll buy again"
Durability
Handy to have around
""
Well worth the money for the amount of cups. Not flimsy.
Good size for growns ups and kids.
Please tell me these are biodegradable. You can use for refills if you keep track of your cup lol
There's nothing I dislike about these cups I use them all the time but I never bought them in bulk before and for the price this was a good deal
"Very good price I read all reviews and they are plastic cups that serve the purpose created for. I have 3 kids so I buy all my plastic ware off amazon in bulk it saves crazy money anyone complaining like it’s supposed to do anything other than the purpose served is expecting to mush from plastic cups and should invest in real dishes. I purchased the case of 1000 black plastic soup spoons, regular spoons in black and black forks and white knives in January and I’m still. It even halfway through the boxes with a household of 5 plus parties and visitors and sleepovers. I spent about 13-17 per box of 1000 and it’s been my greatest investment I purchased these 180z which were bigger so those are for my husband and I and I purchased the 16oz hefty for the kids but I’m about to find something smaller they are 10-9-8. I was spending about $5 to $8 a week in plastic products. I hate washing dishes and using my dishwasher kills the water bill for no reason. You won’t regret this purchase. I’m looking for bulk plastic plates and bowls 18oz now."
"Bought these to drink from, and they work for that purpose. What else can you say about plastic cups, really?"
"Nice sized drinking cups. Water is expensive where I live, so I use paper instead of washing dishes."
Cups arrived ontime. Undamaged. In manufacturing packaging.
The red cup lightweight and perfect size
"Nice plastic cups. And, sent in boxes in a huge box. Wonderful! Thanks for the tinder! Boxes burn clean."
"Less heavy duty than the Solo cups, but they serve the same purpose and are very reliable."
Value pack of cups
Awesome perfect in a bang for my buck. I will always keep buying them again and again.
Perfect for an alternative to the solo brand
"I usually buy the red cups from one of the warehouse stores. These are just as good, but were delivered. I like that they came in a box, in multiple sleeves. They store more easily than the single large sleeve I usually buy."
Order it now. No better.
Exactly as described
I used them for liquid drinks
I have ordered several times! Love them!
Big value durable
Great Value.
The red cups are much sturdier than the clear ones. They are similar to Solo's.
Must have for party
Regular cups nothing special
Whats not to like. I liked every bit of this RED Cup
Great quality product. Highly recommend.
Amazon red cups are greatly priced. They compare favorably to the brand name ones.Great buy.
As advertised
Solo cups is what we used to buy but they kept getting increasingly more expensive. Try these you wont go back and you’ll save money.
All the cups are sturdy and can carry whatever liquid you need it to. The fact that you can get a pack of 240 is amazing in and of itself.
"These are the best cups ever, they hold water beer soda milk juice and many other things. They don't Leak! They are also bright RED so you don't loose them I love ! them"
Worked for what we needed at the time.
Great for picnics.
Great product.
"These used to be the best cups ever. Thick, sturdy, perfect.... Now they are thin, flimsy and smell like chemicals! Back to SOLO for us."
Using for wedding good cups
Holds up after multiple uses
I don't know what you mean about warmth
Got exactly the number i needed of Red Cups for spring planting. These are the Red cup we all use and usually have to buy many more than we want. Good job Amazon
We use these all the time for church functions.
Holds liquids and ya don't have to waSH
Bought these months ago still have a ton left.
These cups are great I use them all the time I will be buying a lot more of them and they are great for party’s
No complaints
"Perfect ! Obviously it’s a cup, sturdy as the famous red ones only less expensive and higher quantities! Great deal."
Just the size I needed. They work great. They aren’t super strong so they may crack off your are too rough.
"These are not very study, but they are OK for the job."
A lot of the cups were stuck together and very hard to separate
Great classic product
I thought these would be like the red cups from costco! What a disappointment! They leak if you look at them . I had ice water in one in the well of a lounger I was sitting in. Water steered leaking everywhere! Pure junk ! Very disappointed !
The first time I purchased this item I had no problems. This is the second time and they stick together almost as if they were glued. Very inconvient!
Great for when you don't want to wash a cup!
Exactly what was ordered
Please Make Some changes in the size so it can fit in any cup holder like Thinner and Taller
All good ‘. No issues.
"At first thought was good deal, but got it incorrect on math"
"Wow I was surprised at the quality! We buy a ton of cups for our employees, and most of the time, the cups are gone but we have a lot of lids left. So we just needed a good deal on a bigger quantity of just paper cups. This is a steal! It comes down to 17 cent a cup, which compared to other sellers, was cheap! Will be purchasing these on repeat! :)"
I bought these to use for my coffee. I can cut down on washing dishes. Call me lazy I know I am but I say the dishwasher says thankyou.
These cups are hard to find due to the supply shortages. I haven't used the cups yet but they look like just as I wanted.
"I’m a massage therapist and was sick of handing clients water in these flimsy cups that bend as soon as they make contact with water and only made up a sip of water. These are the perfect amount of liquid, maybe 3 gulps, and the cups are durable."
Very splendiferous quality. Packaging was ace. Delivery was immensely quick. A+++
The boxes they came in were sturdy . I ordered them for our social hour at my church
Nice quality paper. Not plastic lined. Perfect for little hands!
"Soooo many cups! Perfect for glue portions instead of glue sticks, perfect for quick water break for my 2-5yr olds, and perfect for simple crafts."
These cups come in handy for our water machine. They are the perfect size for children.
Good item for the price.
Love the size. I bought these to use at an 80th birthday open house. They were great except when using them for hot beverages like coffee and hot chocolate.
Surprised that a sleeve is not needed with hot beverage.
Does not keep liquids hot for long time
Nobody wants 5 cups at a time!
The cups leak. I tried to tell that to seller and they did not acknowledge the problem.
The cups all stick together
"This products leaks once there's coffee in it for a few minutes, using two cups at a time to get by. Can't leave coffee in it overnight, lol."
One use no refills. If you try to drink a second cup out of this or drink your first cup too slowly the seams will split along the side and bottom. Your first cup is just fine if you drink it relatively quickly. Otherwise it will leak on your furniture. We've used a full sleeve and it happens with every single cup.
Use it for water not for coffee or buy coffee cup heat holder
It says hot and cold but the hot is just too hot to hold
"Cups are packed to tight, can't be used in dispenser."
"Arrived ahead of schedule, all good condition, in sleeves of 50 wrapped in plastic. These will replace the dixie cups I usually buy, as those are no longer being produced. Sturdy basic cups for use brushing teeth."
Been using in my preschool classroom. Works great for those who need a drink or to hold some paint or to scoop out snacks.
"We were looking for a replacement for the cups we've been getting for many, many years that are now hard to get. Took a shot with these and we are satisfied with the value and quality."
I LOVE THESE GLASSES. They are a bit on they pricier side but I love the quality and design of them. I just wish I could order more than 4 pc.
I made Mother’s Day cups for my sisters. Bought the lid & straw separately but the quality is perfect. & packaging was great
These glasses are worth it! I will be buying more. Thick glass. The mouth of the glasses are slightly imperfect but you can’t tell unless you are staring at it.
Super cute perfect for iced coffee definitely dishwasher safe I just wish they were a little bigger but other than that I really like them
"I’m obsessed! I was being super gentle with these when I first got them because I wasn’t sure how sturdy they were, but they’ve held up so well that i don’t worry about them at all anymore. Highly recommend"
"These glasses make me feel so fancy.! So smooth, I’m afraid to use the straws though lol"
I love these glasses. They feel a little in the thin side so I hand wash them. I’m sure they are dishwasher safe but I prefer to hand wash.
Glass is thick and strong. I even dropped a straw all the way to the floor and it didn’t bust.
"Absolutely love these glasses! Perfect for my morning coffee, lemon water, & iced matcha 💕 the aesthetic is so cute & trending right now. They are a tad wobbly but other than that you NEED"
"This set of glasses far exceeded any expectation I had. These are the durable, high quality drinking glasses. They come with thick glass straws and two tools to clean them. No doubt these will hold up well in the dishwasher. They were packaged nicely as well."
These cups are so aesthetically pleasing and really nice quality.
great quality and value love the straws too highly recommend
""
Don’t hesitate! These glasses are soooo cute and trendy. Anytime I use these glasses for guests I get compliments. Love that it comes with a straw cleaner. I’m not gentle with these and they have held up great. One of my favorite Amazon buys
Love these so much exactly what I wanted. Have held up to washing and falling over without breaking.
Loved these and the glasses are a lot thicker than I thought they would be… super cute
""
Exactly what I was looking for! The glasses and straws were in tact. I’m going to enjoy my daily cold brew so much more now! 10/10. Highly recommend!
Easy to clean and no more wasted straws
"Exactly what I wanted. Has held up well so far and actually holds quite a large amount of liquid! The straws come with cleaners to make that easier, but everything is glass (even the straws) so be careful! Super cute & aesthetic."
Trendy cute everything is positive
super quality!
The straw it’s so cool it comes with a brush to clean the straw. they look so pretty with a glass of lemonade
Sturdy glasses love the straws.
"Great material, thick enough and so fun to drink iced coffee with"
Exactly what I wanted
I love these and the glass straws are awesome!
""
"Super sturdy glasses and straws, aesthetically pleasing and heavily complimented whenever my friends come over!"
I love them they are so nice. They are exactly what the description says
"So far, very sturdy and easy to clean with the straw cleaner."
Love these! Have my morning coffee in them. Easy to clean and love the straws that come with! Packaging was great as well.
i love these cups and the straws
High-end drinking glasses; AMAZING quality; wrapped extra carefully!
Very nice product came packaged well and looks really nice.
Love these cups. A lot more sturdy then I thought they’d be. One of my straws came broken but otherwise perfect!
Good
I got for my iced coffee but use them for all my drinks
the best inlove with this glass cups
I have 2 left... my kids broke the other 2 just washing them lol other then that they're my favorite.
"another reviewer mentioned a piece of glass breaking off causing them to accidentally ingest. well, sadly the same thing happened to me today. as pictured, a large piece of the glass straw broke off while drinking an iced coffee. it was not discovered until the beverage was fully drank. ER visit later and x-rays could not find the glass lodged in my neck or the elsewhere. (esophagus pain since swallowing). dr advised my esophagus has likely been sliced while swallowing and should pain insist then an ENT needs to be consoled for an endoscopy while sedated. fingers crossed that is not necessary. awful experience — aesthetic glasses but do NOT recommend whatsoever. item needs to be removed from listing ASAP."
Although these cups are cute they are NOT safe I was drinking my soda out of this cup and I sucked up a piece of glass the glass had chipped off of the side of the straw. That could’ve led to an emergency.
"the glasses and straws are great - super aesthetically pleasing! unfortunately one of my glasses seems to have a very tiny hole on the bottom that allows some liquid to drain out :( I’ve only had the glasses maybe 2 weeks and have specifically tried alternating between all of them so that I don’t overuse one and have never dropped one. unfortunate because otherwise, they seem pretty sturdy"
Missing cleaning brushes! Didnt feel like going thru a return to repurchase (Option given) so just kept them…
Nice straw provided but the size was not what I expected. I photo will have to be resized to get a better idea of its actual size. Disappointed 😞
These are expensive glasses and they’re made so cheaply. They seem hefty but you can’t put the in the dishwasher or the sink. I put my in the sink and when it made contact with my sink it shattered.
""
"The glasses aren’t thick compared to what you see in videos , but there easy to clean"
Got my cups today! I love them but I only got 3 straws instead of 4…
The glasses themselves were beautiful but upon opening one of them was cracked (despite the packaging). I’m hoping to get a new one to replace the cracked one I received.
"We were so sick of breaking real glasses… grab these for our every day water tea milk and juice we absolutely love them, easy to clean. Cute colors. Not really for company but they are a great size and perfect for our every day life."
"Great sturdy cups. Do well in the dishwasher. Easy to clean, but they do sweat so don't buy if that's important to you."
They're pretty and I like them. They feel sturdy and I got them at a good price They stack well so they're excellent for those of us who tend to hoard cups in our rooms. I think this kind of plastic is better for the environment too vs clear plastic but I could be wrong.  No issues with the dishwasher or in use yet but I've only had them a month.
I bought these cups to use as an instrument in my Elementary Music class. These cups are super durable and they have not broken after 500 students have used them by tapping them and hitting them on the ground. I love them so much I am thinking about getting a set to use at home.
"I really like these cups. They were cheaper than most I looked at and have been extremely durable. They are hard plastic and holds up well in dishwasher. They are no match, however, for my dog 🥴. He has gotten a hold of a couple that got left outside. Great buy."
I didn't expect these to be as sturdy as they are. I bought them for my niece who has they small children. Great product.
""
"I live in a house with ALL boys. Age 18, 22, 26 and 38. they brake, lose, or somehow manage to damage everything in my kitchen. These cups have held up to these boys!"
"Wonderful product for everyday use in a busy household. Ordered the blue. Quality great. Quantity gets us through an entire day. Throw in the dishwasher, not one problem!"
"Good price. Last a long time. I was thinking of getting the clear acrylic or plastic, but they would scratch over time and distort the glass. So I went with these."
We love our new tumblers. They are stackable and very durable. We use them for all our cold beverages. Would purchase again.
outstanding in every way. I rarely ever say that about a product nowadays. This one is the exact opposite of junk. Abstractcowboy
Perfect cups nothing more to say. Nice colors and works well as far as cups go. Haven't broken and they are flexible.
Much better than expected — great colors - sturdy and so much nicer than a solo cup!! Very pleased!
"not much to say about them, they're cups.ran em in a microwave.... ran em in a dishwasher... didnt melt....10/10"
"Arrived in a box covered in some type of oil or grease. The box smelled as did the cups. Washing the cups got rid of the smell for most of them, attempting another wash to see if the smell will go away.  The cups themselves are a great size and work as intended."
These cups look nice. They were a great addition to my color scheme.
These cups are great and durable. They don't feel like a cheap hard plastic and are holding up. The colors are also nice!
"Great replacement for glass. You drop it, you only clean up liquids."
Brought these to Firehouse and the guys haven't broken any. in the dishwasher everyday and still doing their job
It can be put in a dishwasher making cleaning very easy.
Got these on sale. Great solid cups for the money. Have a nice textured grip too so they don’t slide out of your hand. Colors also don’t fade after dishwasher use.
"Cups as advertised. Big, sturdy and inexpensive"
Just what I thought they would be
"These exceeded my expectations. And they’re just cups, so that’s saying something."
They seem like they will work for a while
I love these cups!!!
nice size tumblers. Dish washer safe.
Love these colors and durability
Love them
"I like these a lot, they feel nice, they’re indestructible. Perfect"
"These are just the size and shape I was hoping for. They're not too bulky, but they still hold a decent amount of liquid. When full, they don't tip too easily. They stack well."
"Nice, clean colors. Sturdy construction."
for the money this is an awesome product. you get cups in different colors. the cups are very durable and long lasting. price is good. would order again
Love these and the colors!
"very nice design and feel. I needed to replace older glasses and cups, that were either broken or missing, and these were a great buy for the money!"
Great cups price is very reasonable
Haven’t used them yet but they are so pretty great for what i needed them for.. I would recommend this product!!
I am so happy with my purchase! Nice colors and the cups don’t sweat. Very easy to hold.
Great purchase
A little thinner than I expected but a good price for 12 of them. I am happy. They can go in the dishwasher and the microwave so I can't complain.
"The only reason I gave these cups 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of my cup orders had 6 cups the same color. Should of been 4 colors, 3 cups each. Obviously color doesn't effect the effectiveness of the cups so it's not that big of a deal."
"Sturdy cups, but protruding edges on the inside (maybe for stacking?) make it not totally smooth."
"While these cups are both easy to clean and very aesthetically pleasing, the first couple washes or so will leave the rims on the cups with plastic burrs which, while don't impact the overall functionality of the cup, can be an unpleasant sensation to the lips."
"Idk why but when I got them they seemed really dirty and had a few scuffs, I almost sent them back, but I'm in the middle of moving so they work for now."
Nice color and very sturdy but larger than I expected.
"I gave two stars due to the fact I only received 4 cups ,but they work great and I think if they sent me 4 more I’d fix my stars"
The cups themselves are great! Unfortunately the beige cups did not come with the set.
Good purchase
These were much thinner than I expected and just felt like dollar-store plastic glasses.
Unusable because the drinking edges are sharp. Poor manufacturing and QC
These make water taste like plastic.
Super chewers dogs can break these easily.
Great color selection! They are tall and made of a good material so I expect they’ll last awhile! So glad I found them
"I bought two different color sets of these cup I absolutely love them  Having said that, both my son and my husband said they don’t like the feel of them  Neither one has diagnosed sensory challenges  However, this is important to keep in mind if you or a loved one with a sensory challenge would use these cups"
"Solid drinking cups. I wash them in the dishwasher, top shelf. No problems"
"I love the pretty colors of the cups, easy to clean and they are sturdy."
I would recommend them.
What was I thinking 🤦🏻‍♀️
THIS WAS A WEDDING GIFT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. I CANNOT RATE WHAT YOU WANT RATED. I USE AMAZON FOR GIFTS AND DO YOU NOT REALIZE THE GIVER CANNOT RATE WHAT YOU WANT RATED. sorry.... Judy Wright
"I was really over thinking 🤔 if buying the cups or not cause of other reviews I had read, but I took the risk & I'm glad I did cups where what I expected there not as strong as the brand Solo, the material is a little bit thinner. My personal opinion I like them 😌 they worked for me."
I really like and needed this size cups they are sturdy and colorful.These cups are perfect for adults as well as children without waste the perfect size.
These were for an event and they looked great and gave pops of color everywhere
Cups look great and very colorful. I'll be using them at our party. They look sturdy and easy to handle.
The Pre-K class LOVED these. Exactly as described. A good portion size for kids.
"Me gusto lo volvere a comprar, se me hace facil ya que tengo 3 niños y no tengo que fregar todo el tiempo."
Over priced
These cups are so small and what thin flimsy plastic. Boo. Thumbs down 👎
"With holiday season as known as parties season, these are the must have, especially for house hold with small kids. These come in 4 vivid colors as shown on the picture, exactly 12 oz. For the party, I actually prefer this size than the full size 16 oz since it's too big, the guest will leave left over drink all over the house. These are kid friendly with color coded and small enough for them to hold. Compared quality to Costco 16 oz redcup, these are the same quality, yet better because Costco does not sale them in this size and in these colors, plus this is Prime shipping. Kudos to Amazon for it. And if you play beer pong, these are perfect size, too. Highly recommend."
"These cups came in just in time for the holidays. These 12 ounce plastic cups are perfect for kid's drinks. The kids can easily hold them in their hands with no problem and there is plenty of liquid for them too. Sturdy, okay for one time use or so and convenient too. Love the selection of colors!"
"Not m much to say about these, they do exactly what they are supposed to do. They are a little smaller then the other solo cups but honestly not by that much. I really like the purple color."
"These disposable party cups are decent quality, but much smaller than the regular red party cups that I typically see, and cost more too for the same quantity. I'm spatially challenged, so unless I see what 12oz looks like, I don't have a picture in my head until I actually see it. With that said, the colors are pretty cute and vibrant. They arrived with no damage, which is a surprise considering my last order of party cups for a different brand came in pretty bad shape, so it gets points for that. Value wise, it could cost less, but I really like these cups."
What I like about this package of cups is that you get 240 cups and there is a variety of colors. So if you have a birthday party or something.. you have cups to match. The 240 amount is a great value and last a long time so you don't have to replace every little bit. Very sturdy cups and well made. Holds a full 12 ounces.
"The price of these cups at the time of this review is $29.99 for 240 cups. The value for the money at this price is not worth it for this product as other stores charge half the price for red solo cups. These cups are slightly smaller and thinner plastic compared to a red solo cup. The cups work great and the colors are nice, but the price is just too high for these cups."
"These disposable cups are good for party since it comes in several different colors. I'd suggest not to use this for little kids since the cups are a little flimsy (not as tough as the one from Costco), so kids will break it and spill their drink if they accidentally grab it too hard. Other than that, 12oz cup is a perfect size for party."
"These crazy expensive cups are fine. They are colorful and fairly sturdy. Textured for easier grip. Lids are not included. But at the current price of 30 bucks, they are crazy overpriced. You can purchase “name-brand” cups for much less."
I would not purchase these again. Very flimsy/weak. Several had pin holes and many had streaks like this where the material is super thin.
Great value
The colors matched ourt Mexican taco bar theme
sturdy yet colorful very nice
No
"Not worth it in my opinion not durable, cups stick together, and way to many were cracked. They feel super thin."
"After reading the reviews I was kind of skeptical about the purchase, but just after the second time of using the cups I must say I love them. What I really like about these cups is that they are not stuck together and we do not have to apply/bend/crack the cup to get it loose from the stack. I will order these again and highly recommend."
These cups are easier to use than the typical paper bathroom cups. They are much better for anyone who has difficulty holding small objects.
The cups are sturdy and easy to use at a great price. I highly recommend these cups if you need a 5oz cup.
"Fits perfectly in our bathroom cup holder. Product is a lot sturdier than the hard to find, correct size paper cups."
"Purchased as a gift for a relative who loves them, better than what's offer local"
Works
I liked everything about the product
It looks as described in the picture comes in a small white box.
Meet my expectations
Great cups! probably best value for your money.
"My family uses these cups in the bathroom. They are perfect for our kids and work better than the paper cups because they don't deteriorate. The paper cups caused all kinds of messes for my littles so we decided to try these plastic ones and it's a game changer for sure! Now, we all use these cups for water to rinse our mouths or for mouth wash."
"Just the right size for rinsing, mouthwash, after brushing. Would also make great holder for bedside pills for handicap or sick person. Also for small children's drink of water."
"It’s a great value, delivered timely, and the value exceeded my expectations."
"Perfect multi use little cups! We use them for mouth rinse cups, and to put meds in for our elderly mother."
"Flimsy. I bought these to mix paint in for acrylic pours. Way too delicate for that. And there's a raised indentation in the cup bottom that keeps you for really getting in there and scraping up up all that pricey paint. A big ""nope"" for me."
Like their durability.... Use them for art and art projects
Versatile usage! The clear cup allows you to Always see how much and what is inside. Absolutely love it in the bathroom!!
Pretty cheap. Like free ones in cheap motels.
"Hi, so these cups were ordered by me for my bday gathering. Was rxcited to recieve them. Thinking they would be the regular size beer pong red cups! To my surprise! They were half that size! Perfect for lil kids not adults. Have been useful around the house for a quic shot of cold water, or milk for a snack. Nice clear cups, my mistake was not knowing the liquid volume size!"
Good for bathroom use.
tiny and flimsy only good definately not drinking cups
I didn’t use wasn’t sturdy enough to hold a drink if you held to tight the cup would crush
good for shots I guess
We purchase these all the time for our spa and they’re great!
Perfect for certain works
Good size to use for party shots and mouth wash. Easy to carry. What I was looking for! Fast shipping. Good deal!
We used these for my son's wedding. Very easy to use.
These plastic wine glasses are perfect for any party or gathering. They are sleek and easy to assemble. Surprisingly they are very sturdy! I think I could even wash and reuse!
"I am so happy with these I didn't even wait to get the box into the house! Packed and shipped extremely well.  The last photo I wanted to show you as I was holding the glass by the base. If you've never used this type of disposable glass, you need to give a slight twist when assembling. If they still feel loose, use a dab of super glue. I've done many parties over the years, and this trick has never failed. Really looking forward to using these at our Passover Seder this year."
They looked very cute on the table for my birthday party
"I bought these for an event at work and they looked gorgeous on the tables. Unfortunately when separating all the plastic bottoms, many of them broke. They are pretty flimsy. If you are getting these for your event I would suggest ordering at least 20 cups more than you actually need knowing several will break as you are putting the base on the cup."
Come packed very well however be careful opening. Shrink wrap is very tight-caused one base to crack.
These glasses are nice & cute but we had a few spills because the bottoms slipped off. If you're not paying attention to notice the bottom no longer attached & sit your cup down your beverage waste everywhere
"These glasses were affordable and fit right in with the decor, cute , perfect"
If you don't want anyone to break your good glass wear buy this.
"I loved the rose gold accent, but disliked the removable base."
"I was excited to use these as they matched the theme of my dinner party and looked very pretty but . . . EVERY ONE of the glasses leaked!!! Wine quickly poured out of some of the glasses and some just dripped slowly out continually all night. There was wine spilling out all over my patio during appetizers and the ones that appeared ok started to leak all over my dining room tablecloth during dinner. Out came the trusted dixie cups! Luckily, soaking my tablecloths overnight, helped the tablecloth stains. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
"Son muy bonitas, pero es fatal calidad la base, se desprende todo el tiempo y en la actividadlas personas estaban un poco incomodas. Muy mal."
These are so cheep! The bottoms kept falling off and when they did there’s a small hole in the bottom of the cup they would leak all over. Not worth your money.
The cups are 2 pieces that you need to put together and many times the bottoms come off and the cups leak on the bottom
"They came unassembled They were very thin they would not stay put together, we tried with a little tacky glue some still came apart. Not good at all we will not be able to use them at our event."
"Be careful when you pick it up. The base will fall off sometimes, or just not come up with the rest of the cup. Luckily, we avoided spills."
"I was so excited to get these to match a plate set that I bought. When I opened the box, some of the bottoms were broken. Then when I tried to assemble the not broken pieces, all of them broke as I was trying to put them together. Very unsatisfied."
The product came very badly packaged. The box was already torn and damaged. The glasses inside the plastic packaging were broken. I was only able to salvage 17 out of 30. The quality is horrible. Do not buy!!!!!!
I had to throw out the entire box because the cups leaked. Not worth even what I paid for them
"These are very nice party Glasses (plastic) they are super cute and very durable. Easy to assemble, you could even wash and reuse multiple times. For the price they are a great party staple."
"These plastic wine glasses are beautiful! Can be used for a girls night in, or just on a casual basis! Will definitely buy again!"
Packaging was great. No broken or cracked glasses. Used these for a birthday party and they worked great. Sturdy enough for adults. The bottoms stayed on the whole night also.
"We purchased these for a small wine tasting party we were having and were very pleased with the quality of these wine glasses. Not only are they beautiful to look at but sturdy as well! All our guests commented on the beautiful glasses. They are disposable for health reasons. There are many disposable glasses, however, the beautiful trim on these sets them at top rate! They come in a very nice package and snap together easily. These made easy clean up after the party as they are also recyclable or can be washed and used again. Guests could have a couple extra and not worry about damaging the China. We restocked for our next event as the value. These come very nicely packaged for storage."
"These are great disposable cups to have for fancy parties, weddings, or dinners. They look really nice but are a one time use item. It's great if you want to have a fancy look on a budget and don't want to do all the dishes after the party. The gold bottom and rim really class it up. They arrive in a nicely packaged box with bubble wrap. The glass and the stand are two different parts so when you open the box and unwrap them, you then put the bottom stands onto the tops/stems. Overall, they are a great alternative to expensive real glass that will only used once and these look like the real deal on the table, only once you pick them up do you feel that they are plastic."
Used for a wedding reception. Elegant and added to the decor with the gold accent. I was very pleased with these.
I like the size of the cup meshed right in the middle or a decent amount of drink.
Cups were great for serving margaritas at our party.
Perfect for an outdoor garden ladies brunch. We used them for Bloody Mary’s and they held full garnishes. Good cup!
These cups are sturdier than traditional plastic cups. Nice size. Over all good quality for the price
"They were beautiful, used at a Wedding and were perfect!"
Very elegant and sturdy cup! Great value and washable!
Love these glasses great quality. Better than I expected
Used at Birthday party for water on table looked elegant
I bought these for my daughter and son-in-law’s wedding and they worked really well! They were very nice looking and durable!
They are worth the purchasw
Me gusto
"I love the price and product, it was perfect"
I banged the cup trying to break one and it would not crack .strong and durable
Worked great for tea and water at prom!
Good product. Durable
I wouldn’t spend 20$ on flimsy cups. They are pretty small and not as big as the cover Picture. But they are cups. I wouldn’t buy again in Im being honest
Not good quality
Used for wedding- worked great!!
Perfect for wedding reception
"These cups really surprised me. They are elegant, strong, and beautiful."
Very good & worth the price
"It came on time. They are very pretty, sturdy cups. Good for any event."
"Waste of money, the cup’s stuck together and when trying to separate them they broke."
Nothing
"I really love the way these look, and I love that their aluminum is completely recyclable pretty much anywhere, unlike pretty much any other plastic cup. But there are a number of issues that just make them undesirable.  Let us first start with the fact that aluminum is a super-effective heat-transfer medium. If you're holding an iced drink in one of these, it doesn't matter how hot it is, you're going to be risking frost-bite. In the meantime, the aluminum is quickly pulling your body heat into your drink. If you try to put a hot drink in ones of these cups, you're doomed.  Durability is the other problem. You never really think of a plastic cup as durable, but it is pretty undeniable that most of them when you dent a plastic cup, it pops right back out to round again. Aluminum wears a bit harder. Don't get me wrong, they're plenty-sturdy. They're not going to collapse on you any more than an aluminum can does.  But they pick up dings and dents in shipping and storage so that, by the time you get to using them, they already are starting to look used.  Lastly, there's one last thing that creeps me out: teeth. I don't know if there's and actual galvanic action going on, or if this is all in my imagination, but water just tastes a little ... electrical... out of these cups. Imagining chewing on foil just makes using these cups even more difficult.  So, am I going to use them? Well, if I'm throwing a kegger I'm still breaking out the red solo cups. But if I'm having a couple people over for a BBQ, there's gonna be a stack of these in the cupboard along with other fancy disposables like bamboo that I'm gonna be happy to break out."
"This is a genius idea. I am shocked it hasn't been around longer. These are the same size as a traditional solo plastic cup. Great for entertaining, and saves money and better for the planet. While they are not dishwasher safe, they're easy to clean and reuse. They're sturdier than a plastic cup, but lighter than i thought they were (in a good way). They're very drinking game-friendly as far as the weight is concerned and keep drinks cold. This one's a no-brainer for me. I already ordered a second set to gift for Christmas."
"Firstable, I love the idea of 100% recyclable products!, it's not expensive for a durable product and for the idea of re-using and recycling. It doesnt change the taste of your beverage, it keep them cold, so... it's a fantastic idea and a great job! I'm going to buy more for my friends, family and events!! Congrats Ball for that innovation."
"Sooo much better than the solo cups. I know they say that these are recyclable, and I will do that eventually, but I plan to reuse for now. Saving money and the planet in the long run."
This is exactly what I was expecting. I will definitely be purchasing these instead of solo cups going forward.
"Went to the Waste Management Phoenix Open and they serve all drinks in aluminum solo cups. Loved them. Went here to Amazon and found these. They are a little taller than the WM cup but otherwise exactly the same. They are awesome. The bad reviews are missing the point here. 1) they are not meant to be permanent they are still disposable. Saying that, they hold up very well. Of course they get dings they are aluminum. They are about 3-5x thicker than a soda can. Hold up better than plastic for sure. 2) one reviewer said they dont keep drinks colder. Hmmm well i can tell you this. Holding a frosty ice cold cup somehow sure seems better than a plain old plastic solo cup. Think moscow mule cold when you get a mule in a copper cup. The cold tasteless metal of these cups just give off a refreshing experience. Way better than plastic. 3) dishwasher safe ? Mine have been washing fine. Not sure why one reviewer says otherwise. 4) i don’t believe they are meant for hot drinks just like you wouldnt with a plastic cup. Buy these cups if you enjoy ice cold beverage experiences and want to class up a large gathering or party where your serving drinks !"
"It seems there’s a lot of pointless negative reviews on this cup. Let’s try and straighten that out.  First off, it’s not for hot liquids. Obviously metal conducts heat and you will burn your hands. Use a mug or styrofoam.  Second, no it’s not dishwasher safe. The heater in your dishwasher will warp the aluminum. It’s a cup, just rinse it out.  Third, it’s not supposed to last forever. The material is very thin and that’s why you get so many cups for this price. There are plenty of metal cups that last a lifetime on Amazon so just buy those if that’s what you want.  Otherwise a good product. Nicer than plastic cups and great for holding a cold beer. Just have realistic expectations and you will be satisfied. On a side note, I do see the problem with packaging and how some people will receive bent cups after shipping. That’s definitely something they can do better."
"One of the things the product doesn't recommend is dishwashing them... I get it. They're light weight, they could easily flip over, end up in the bottom of the dishwasher just like a plastic disposable cup and heating on the heating element during the drying cycle. That being said, I have successfully washed them a few times already with no deterioration of the paint or usability. I'm not encouraging breaking the dishwasher rule but... in case you were wondering...  Some mention the cool transfer that happens and I LOVE that. Not only am I consuming a cool drink I feel cooler because my hand is cooled by the cup-- it's sort of a mind trick and double duty, but it makes me think back to the days of having homemade iced tea from stainless steel cups and my aunt's house when I was a little kid. I loved feeling the cool temperature through the cup itself.  I have only one bit of advise: The cups are WORDY with text. I love them. Maybe after people understand the rules like DON'T MICROWAVE METAL and other things, we could have some with a little less text or a little more design? I love them. I wonder what else they could make me like this. Fully loved and recommended."
"Cups have no insulating value but that is not an issue for me. they are strong enough to not dent all the time, would not recommend holding them with any strength. They are a great replacement for plastic cups. I've been reusing mine for almost 2 months and only had to trow away a few cups, Best part is its aluminum and am certain it'll get recycled and not end up in a landfill like most plastics. will not work with hot drinks and cold drinks will get warm faster than normal but that's a small price to pay for it."
"I first learned of these cups at a graduation cookout in the summer of 2021! I came home that evening, did some research and ordered some myself! I love these cups! They are super sturdy, your drinks stay cold and they keep ice a little longer than traditional red solo cups. I have even converted two of my neighbors and their friends on to these cups—now they use them all the time for football tailgates, cookouts and holiday parties. The only drawback is that they can sweat about the same as a solo cup, but the trade off is worth it, because your beverage stays colder for longer. Lastly, it is also a classy look! Now you and your party attendees can look like professional adults and not like college undergraduates at a fraternity party. 😆"
"I LOVE these cups! There is nothing like an ice cold drink, in one of these, on a hot day. The cup itself is refreshing! I have switched entirely from using plastic. These can be re-used over and over, they wash beautifully in the dishwasher, no worry about melting. The only time I recycle them is if they get dinged-up, but that is rare because they are so sturdy. Even though, at the beginning these cups are more expensive than plastic, the amount of times I have been able to re-use them has made them virtually free in the end! I also am happy that I'm not filling up a landfill with so much plastic junk. After we have a party, I send people home with their cups, they LOVE it! I am very happy with this purchase."
Don't recommend it.  Very easily broken after one use.
"I never thought I’d be thrilled with a disposable cup, but here I am raving over these! These cups are sturdy, yet lightweight (as aluminum should be). You can actually rinse and reuse them, which helps to save the planet in a small way. The best thing I love about them is they keep your beverage icy cold! The ice doesn’t melt as quickly as in a plastic cup and they are truly recyclable. The only downside is the price. I just wish they were a little bit less expensive."
"One of those ""why didn't someone make these years ago?"" products. Sturdier than plastic, looks good and environmentally friendly--Brilliant! Only gripe is they're not dishwasher safe but not a huge deal breaker. They're still a little scrunchy (maybe it's just my big ogre hands?) but not going to split like most disposable cups. Perfect if you have kids who leave drinkware outside, want something safe for pool-side or anyone prone to dropping stuff. I think I may 3d print some sleeves for the bases to give them some rigidity but that's a whole other project."
My attention was focused on the fact that these last a long time then can be recycled for another use in a matter of days. A baseball stadium got on board and featured the Ball aluminum cups with great success. I am fortunate to live in an area with an outstanding recycle program and am very conscious of my purchases. The most terrific sidebar is family visiting for the holidays have their own cup with names by a Sharpie! I use mine constantly. I show off my cups and tell anyone who is interested how to order.
"100% aluminum and can be recycled over and over without losing quality. As opposed to ""red"" plastic cups (and other like brands) that are not recyclable for most of us, unless you use a private recycling company and pay nearly $100 for a small box you mail in to recycle them. Washing the Ball cups by hand keeps them in good shape though you seem to be limited to how many times you can put these in the dishwasher. That said, if they if they are 100% recyclable, I think you are good to toss them after you get a good use out of them. Definitely kept our drinks cold, positive comments all around and would definitely buy again."
"I pour cold milk in the aluminum cup, it improves the taste and cold feel of the milk. Never never will I ever use a plastic cup again. Yes it is a metal aluminum cup, you can wash and reuse a million times, no need to recycle. At first you think this is expensive, but you can reuse it as many times as you want or put it in the recycle bin which I will never do. Thank You , Thank You who ever come up with this."
"Amazing. Love these, they make cool drinks taste cooler, it sounds crazy but true. Love them and saving the environment too is a plus. Will be reusing them many times as they are sturdy enough for it."
"These cups are great! A little pricy, but they are so durable you won't need to see if they are ""infinitely recyclable"" as they have printed on the side. They're only 16 ounces rather than the usual 20, hence the headline. Not recommended for dishwashing, presumably because they are too light to stay put. They don't bend in your hand when you grip them. Very solid. Other than the price, they are perfect, but if you wash them and reuse them then the price isn't that much of a concern.  Very happy with the purchase."
"I bought these because of the recycling factor and keeping drinks colder. I do think they keep my drinks colder slightly longer but it's not an insulated thermos so it's not working any miracles. They are pretty durable as they've been pushed off of a table by one year olds, and only have some dings. My husband did not like these when they arrived. Then he started using one and decided they were great."
"these are awesome. i have kids, if they are like yours, they take a new cup out of the cabinet everytime they want a drink, and leave it half full on the counter with the other 7 cups theyv used in the past hour... despite what the box says, we run these through the dishwasher. they hold up for a long time. when they get dented, lost, thrown out, left outside - its ok. these are great. will buy again."
"Listen, friends, the last thing I want to do after a party is clean up sticky cups. Gross. But also, I don't want to buy a bunch of single-use plastic because I'm not about that life. ENTER BALL ALUMINUM CUPS. THEY ARE RECYCLABLE. They kept cold drinks cold in hot weather. They were easy to hold in the hand. Our guests raved. We absolutely could have rinsed and reused, but in times of COVID, felt safer to recycle and reorder. THESE ARE AMAZING. PURCHASE WITH NO HESITATION."
Everyone (8) at our gathering on forth of July… used one each and they took it home and to this day they wash it and dry it .. it’s their favorite cup ….they asked where did you get theses …I told them on Amazon..!  We are going on 3 weeks now … out of the 30 cups we have used 3 cups only…it’s our favorite cup..!  11 cups used in total .🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️🧊🧊🧊🧊
"If you want a unique reusable, disposable, classy, perfect party cup — YOU WILL LOVE THESE CUPS. Unique! Like a thick beer can - LOVE THEM! PERFECT FOR THE CAR, work amazingly well with a cozy too!!!!"
"Was at a local watering hole and they served a draft BEER 🍺 in one. Kept it cold until last drop, very impressed. Ordered a set when I got home. I keep 4 in the freezer at all times and have used them several times, guest are always impressed."
Seen a commercial on TV and thought.. what the heck! We're avid campers and thought these cups would make a statement just as seen on tv.. and boy did they.. So well so everyone in our group had to have them too! Perfect for those ice cold adult beverages.. NOT INTENDED FOR HOT USE! They do not last as long as I'd like but you shouldn't babysit your drinks anyway.. They're washable and reusable and I will definitely be buying more if my groups keeps helping themselves to my cup stash! Thanks Ball and thank you Amazon for such a fast delivery!
"I cannot tell you how much I love these cups in one simple sentence. You just have to buy them and know what I am talking about. I never thought it was possible to one up the red plastic disposable cup. Drinking out of these make me want to singing ""Red Solo Cup...you not my friend now"". Lets have a party!"
"I don't understand why ""warmth"" is a question for this review. The cups are the opposite of warm, they keep your drinks wonderfully cold for an extended period of time even without ice. I purchased them to try them out and support the idea of easily recycled products. I find myself using them for everyday use. I love them. As long as you don't use them for hot drinks or put them in the dishwasher they seem that they will last quite a while. It has been a month so far and I'm still using the first two I got out of the box."
Ordered as we had company in town for a week and didn't want to buy plastic nor do a lot of dishes. We loved them as they kept drinks extra cold and easy to hold. I washed daily and reused for 10 days. Could have kept them longer actually. I would def buy again
These cups are great-they are sturdy and pleasing to look at. They definitely seem to keep my drinks cold longer! I was doubtful but I’m glad I took the chance because we really love them. Great to use at our camp and also for get together a at home. Received them very quickly with no issues.
"I like these cups! Yes, they are a little pricey but unless you beat them up they will last a long time. Before I would go through a ton of the plastic Solo cups. These wash-up great. If you've got the money to spare these are for you. They will save you money in the long run and you avoid putting more plastics into a landfill some where."
I like that these cups are totally recyclable. They can be hand washed and reused. Much sturdier than the plastic cups. As a former Ball Corporation employee these have a bit of a sentimental meaning to me. Hopefully as production increases supply will be more readily available and perhaps price may drop slightly.
"These cups are GREAT. I do NOT throw them out, I wash them and use them over and over again because they are so durable and so beautiful. Can be used for hot or cold things. They are very light and easy to carry for kids. We love em."
I love love love my cups. I bought them as memordia to pass out at a party after getting one from a football game. My friends still talk about their cups and we have 8 as a preferred choice over plastic in our home. They keep your drinks much colder but can sweat so a cuzzy is good idea as well. Enjoy and they are recycled and can be recycled over and over
It keeps my drink very cold and I love it! The cups feel premium to me but I don’t know how long it well last keeping my green tea drink cold but it feels like the cup can keep cold for good long time.
"We purchased these cups for a family reunion and specifically used them for mixed drinks and keg beer. They were much nicer than traditional drinking cups, kept drinks cold and were so durable! We asked guests to recycle and actually took most of them home to reuse! Would highly recommend!"
"Product is a money saver. Washes well n tough enough for use over n over again. Guests have come to take their cup home after exposed to the fine workmanship…they just love it! Light, tough clean. Save the planet from cheap trash. Buy Ball Affordable n classy"
Can't say enough good about these no matter what your drinking it well be even colder in these glasses have given away to people who ordered them as well very sturdy and durable I have even washed in the dishwasher on top shelf with no issues I diffenitly well be ordering more
"Likes , reusable, sturdy, Dislikes more expensive at first over it Red Cousin but in the long run turns out cheaper you just have to train your guests not to crush them but keep them to reuse"
These cups keep things cold for a long time! They are great for get togethers. Toss them or reuse them! I have had mine for a while now and everyone likes drinking out of these! Just don’t put them in the dishwasher!
"When I bought them it was more of a chance I took for my birthday bash. Wow! Sturdy and simple to clean (I literally just plunged in sink of hot water and dish soap, dried then put back in box for next event)... love them and glad I was loose with my spending cuz I bought 2 packs. I will buy more! And YES, it does keep beverages colder for a little while but hey.... if you’re walking around with the same beverage for more than 15-25 minutes then perhaps you need to try something else. Lol"
Our drinks stay colder thanks to these cups. And I like the way they feel when I hold my drink. Also I have a long association with Ball Brothers and graduated from Ball State as well
"These are supposed to be disposable but ive been using one for about 2 weeks now. Cleans easily. (even survived in the dish washer) great eco friendly alternative to plastic cups. Keeps drinks cold longer than plastic, looks cooler. Can't beat it"
I ordered a pack of 20 as an alternative to plastic Solo cups for gatherings. Hubby has started to use them for every day use. They keep drinks cold longer; hold up well through the dishwasher; and they are recyclable!
"I really love these cups, i'm still using the first one! Ordered 3 times for parties for my kids. You can label the cups with a marker so everyone knows which cup is theirs for refills. Then they can take them home and reuse over and over again!"
"These cups are fantastic! They keep your drink colder than a plastic cup and it’s like drinking from the can but without the can!! I bought the large box of them and once my kids tried them, they started taking them home!"
People talked about these the whole time at the birthday party! My child had a farmhouse theme birthday party. I just couldn’t find cups that would match everything and didn’t want to go with the traditional red solo cups. I found these on Amazon... and oh were we impressed! They’re sturdy and durable. Much better than solo cups! They matched the farmhouse theme...who else other than Ball brand who makes canning jars! Oh! People were even taking theirs home with them!
"My boyfriend is a milk drinker. He is not, however, a cup rinser. I got these because he leaves glasses of milk sitting out almost every morning and I wanted a throw away cup for those times I'm visiting my mother and don't get to the milk cups in time. These are super easy to clean. So much so that I havent had to toss any out so far. I just like knowing that if I do need to, I can toss them into the recycle bin. Notable: These cups really DO keep drinks cool. 100% recommend!!!"
I bought these cups for use on my dock and boat with friends. They keep your beverage cold and you can reuse them...over and over again. The only reason I have to purchase more is my friends all want them! Worth the purchase. No solo cups for me!
I actually bought a set of neoprene cup holders to use with these because the cup was so cold. I have even washed them in the top rack of dishwasher. But can easily be recycled.
"Tired of the obvious red solo cup? Try these out. Not the cheapest but that can be washed, although not in the dishwasher. I find they keep cold beverages colder, and on a hot day they feel nice and cold in your hand."
I purchased these back in November 2020 I bought a set for myself and two sets as gifts they are absolutely amazing and I hand wash mine every day and set it on my desk at work as well as passed out to coworkers They are strong and durable unlike plastic cups that have thin walls and break easily.
"#1#1#1DISPOSABLE CUP..STRONGER THAN A POP/BEER CAN.LASTS 4EVER..ALWAYS RECYCLABLE..""LET'S SAVE THE EARTH, ONE CAN AT A TIME.""(cpywrt.Misty Bukoski)"
"Great replacement for those red plastic cups. You cant put these in the dishwasher, but I suppose you cant do that with the red ones either. These are excellent for cold drinks. Cant wait until the price drops."
These are so cool…literally. They keep your beverages ice cold for a very long time. They clean up easily and can be used multiple times. Great value!
I love these. Better than red solo cups. Thicker and stronger than I anticipated. Seem to keep the drink cold longer. I like putting them in the recycle bin knowing they are 100% infinitely recyclable.
"All you do is press around on the container to separate the pasta and pop the in the microwave for 60 seconds. They come already cooked, so you're just warming them up. They are really good...every bit as good as the regular ones. I'm definitely buying more."
Coming from someone who buys plastic cups for my family this came to be perfect for they are reusable. i used to throw away 3 cups a day and now i find my self using this for the past 5 days straight (ice water).
"I bought these cup to use at a graduation party and our guests couldn't stop talking about them. They are so sturdy and make your drink stay cooler for longer. I will buy these again, and again."
"I end up reusing the same one over and over again for myself, they’re super sturdy cups and keep drinks cool a long time, large capacity too I have given a few away to all of my friends and they love it this is a winner over flimsy plastic cups in my book"
"A bit pricey. But, a good change from plastic. Nice feel to it.  It was even shipped in a box to prevent damage. Will order again soon. Please continue using a box. No flimsy envelopes required."
"Very good for cold drinks, they somehow test better with this cup. Bad side is they are not made for hot drinks, which you probably wouldn't drink in this type of cup anyway so eh. Very nice cups. 5 stars"
This truly is a miracle cup! The fact that it actually keeps dress cold without using ice is remarkable. Very sturdy as well and highly recommend them for parties!
"We took these cups with us on a camping trip out of state, and wow! These cups get nice and frosty, and keep drinks cold, can be used several times before being thrown out, and are super sturdy. They're a little pricey but worth it!"
"I really like these cups. I bought them for my Juneteenth celebration. I had them out beside the red ""party"" cups Everyone started with the red cups then changed to these. They all liked them too. I will buy again. Great for summer."
"My crew loves a good party and these cups held up just fine. Truly amazing, very light weight and can be reused or recycled when their time is up. They were such a hit I’m ordering more while they are on sale to save for Christmas gifts. What a great way to still enjoy the traditional solo cup feel while doing better for the planet."
We try to recycle as much as possible and these cups are perfect. They are also sturdy and reusable so we also feel they are economical. We have Sunday family dinners and we all like the size and feel of them.
"This is a great alternative to #5 plastic cups, which in my area aren’t recyclable yet. These cups are very sturdy and I have been washing and re-useing most of them. But, I don’t feel bad about tossing them into the recycling bin either. Very pleased with this purchase. I highly recommend these"
They are really sturdy and keep things really cold. We have been using these since we got them instead of regular glasses because they keep thing really nice and cold. Great product! Haven't recycled one yet.
"We have had these cups for about 30 days after having seen Jason Mamoa's commercial supporting these reusable, aluminum cups. Lightweight, effortlessly stackable, and so far, very durable, we use them daily and enjoy them. They do sweat with very cold drinks but we haven't needed a coaster yet with iced water. We wash them in the dishwasher achoring them a bit so they don't flip during the cycle. Highly recommend and thanks Jason for the great endorsement. Paul K"
"I was really over thinking 🤔 if buying the cups or not cause of other reviews I had read, but I took the risk & I'm glad I did cups where what I expected there not as strong as the brand Solo, the material is a little bit thinner. My personal opinion I like them 😌 they worked for me."
I really like and needed this size cups they are sturdy and colorful.These cups are perfect for adults as well as children without waste the perfect size.
These were for an event and they looked great and gave pops of color everywhere
Cups look great and very colorful. I'll be using them at our party. They look sturdy and easy to handle.
The Pre-K class LOVED these. Exactly as described. A good portion size for kids.
"Me gusto lo volvere a comprar, se me hace facil ya que tengo 3 niños y no tengo que fregar todo el tiempo."
Over priced
These cups are so small and what thin flimsy plastic. Boo. Thumbs down 👎
"With holiday season as known as parties season, these are the must have, especially for house hold with small kids. These come in 4 vivid colors as shown on the picture, exactly 12 oz. For the party, I actually prefer this size than the full size 16 oz since it's too big, the guest will leave left over drink all over the house. These are kid friendly with color coded and small enough for them to hold. Compared quality to Costco 16 oz redcup, these are the same quality, yet better because Costco does not sale them in this size and in these colors, plus this is Prime shipping. Kudos to Amazon for it. And if you play beer pong, these are perfect size, too. Highly recommend."
"These cups came in just in time for the holidays. These 12 ounce plastic cups are perfect for kid's drinks. The kids can easily hold them in their hands with no problem and there is plenty of liquid for them too. Sturdy, okay for one time use or so and convenient too. Love the selection of colors!"
"Not m much to say about these, they do exactly what they are supposed to do. They are a little smaller then the other solo cups but honestly not by that much. I really like the purple color."
"These disposable party cups are decent quality, but much smaller than the regular red party cups that I typically see, and cost more too for the same quantity. I'm spatially challenged, so unless I see what 12oz looks like, I don't have a picture in my head until I actually see it. With that said, the colors are pretty cute and vibrant. They arrived with no damage, which is a surprise considering my last order of party cups for a different brand came in pretty bad shape, so it gets points for that. Value wise, it could cost less, but I really like these cups."
What I like about this package of cups is that you get 240 cups and there is a variety of colors. So if you have a birthday party or something.. you have cups to match. The 240 amount is a great value and last a long time so you don't have to replace every little bit. Very sturdy cups and well made. Holds a full 12 ounces.
"The price of these cups at the time of this review is $29.99 for 240 cups. The value for the money at this price is not worth it for this product as other stores charge half the price for red solo cups. These cups are slightly smaller and thinner plastic compared to a red solo cup. The cups work great and the colors are nice, but the price is just too high for these cups."
"These disposable cups are good for party since it comes in several different colors. I'd suggest not to use this for little kids since the cups are a little flimsy (not as tough as the one from Costco), so kids will break it and spill their drink if they accidentally grab it too hard. Other than that, 12oz cup is a perfect size for party."
"These crazy expensive cups are fine. They are colorful and fairly sturdy. Textured for easier grip. Lids are not included. But at the current price of 30 bucks, they are crazy overpriced. You can purchase “name-brand” cups for much less."
I would not purchase these again. Very flimsy/weak. Several had pin holes and many had streaks like this where the material is super thin.
Great value
The colors matched ourt Mexican taco bar theme
sturdy yet colorful very nice
No
"Not worth it in my opinion not durable, cups stick together, and way to many were cracked. They feel super thin."
These are a TON of coffee cups for the money! They are plain white coffee cups. No frills. No insulation. Just a clean - nice size coffee cup. Great for entertaining when you are afraid your family will break the real mugs!
"We go out and feed the Homeless and bring them hot chocolate and coffee on the weekends, and these are perfect biodegradable cups for them."
L I bought these cups because they were relatively inexpensive first and foremost. And because it was just easier than washing coffee cup after coffee cup I'm lazy. They are very sturdy I've left coffee and them all day I've left water in them all day and they work just fine They do not leak as other reviews have said or at least mine don't and I don't think mine or any different from anybody else's. I would order these again worth the value
Perfect for coffee - I used the same cup to make five cups of coffee today and had no leakage. Some of the other brands I have tried smells so bad that you can't drink out of them.  FYI:. I'm smart enough to know that if I left coffee in this cup for several hours that yes it would eventually weaken the cup and it would leak. With that said after I make a cup of coffee I dump out any leftovers and I reuse the cup later that day. This way I am not wasting money.
"I bought these hot cups for 1st time based on reviews & price. I did not need lids nor sleeves nor stirrers. I have used them for 2 days & they are almost the same as some thicker ones I had previously. I had to use 2 cups ( one inside the other) to hold really hot coffee or tea & then just reversed cups so clean one was on top). Today I had to add a 3rd cup in order to carry drink. They’re not wasted cups as I will use clean ones. These are much cheaper than previous ones which included lids, sleeves & stirrers. I’m happy I bought these . I get 50 more cups for less money than my first purchase & they work fine."
"I have bought these 12oz TashiBox drink cups a few times and I have found a them to be sturdy and durable. They can get somewhat warm to the touch depending on how hot the beverage is, but this can be remedied by a cup collar or standing cup in a mug. I then have been able to use the same cup for numerous cups of coffee before disposal. The price was even lower for cups of that size and number."
These are our favorite brand of paper cups to use. They also come in other options. We love recycling at our house and these are perfect for most things we need them for. I have used these for hot coffee and frozen smoothies. Never had any leakage issues and they even can go in the microwave. Pricey but worth it.
"We are currently in the middle of a kitchen remodel and to avoid doing dishes we got these cups for coffee and tea. I've been using these cups for almost a month now and about 1 out of every 4 cups leaks at the bottom seam. At first I was okay with it because it only left a small ring coffee ring (which wasn't ideal but not a complete hassle) HOWEVER, the one I am using right now at this very moment started leaking a puddle of coffee immediately after pouring the cup (and is what finally prompted this review). I cannot recommend these cups. When I need to purchase more, I will have to look for another brand which is a bummer since the reviews seemed so good for these."
So helpful. I can not tell you how much coffee I have spilled in my car trying to get a traditional coffee cup with a handle on in it into my car's cup holder. These are a brilliant solution for my coffee and tea on the go.
"I used these cups for making microwave cakes with my grandson. They are well constructed and perfect for that purpose. They also hold up well to hot coffee or tea...I used paper plates and bowls all the time, 'cause my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher, and they are well worth the price."
"Instead of serving plastic bottles of water to a banquet I was hosting, I used these cups for water and lemonade (gotten from a large water jug). They are a great serving size and were very easy to hold."
I searched everywhere for an affordable paper coffee cup and this is the winner!! It’s a great price and a cup can sit for hours without leaking which is a big bonus since not everyone in my office pours out their left over beverages!! The only down side is when you pour very hot liquid in it the outside of the cup does get really warm
I'm very happy with these hot cups. I purchased a box of 120 and was pleasantly surprised at the durability of these cups. A good thickness and stury construction. I will purchase these again.
"These cups are great, very sturdy and durable! And packaging was great they didn't come all loose they were in a box that held them perfectly in place and not crushed."
I purchased them for my Keurig and they’re perfect
Great value! These cups are super sturdy and I love the simple sleek look of them versus styrofoam which I hate using for coffee cups! These are going to be perfect for an upcoming party we’ll be having as well. Would be great for cold beverages as well.
"For the price, these paper cups did the job. Hot or cold drinks. Rum or Vodka. Even red wine. These cups were sturdy, durabile and a great value. I would buy themfor the whole family again. Cheers. #trump2024"
I like quality Recommended
I use these downstairs for my Keurig. They work great and don't alter the flavor like other products do.
"The cups are nice, thick and durable, we use these for both hot and cold beverages, and they don't get weak quickly like other paper cups. I have not had any leaking issues."
"I use these daily, and reorder when the supply runs low"
I love these cups they're nice and thick they look great for my daughter's wedding for coffee
Plain cups good size at a great a great price. Cuos are insulated but sturdy without leaks.
its a paper cup .. dont expect it to be durable without chemicals etc.. gets soft on 3rd drink coffee etc.. Oh well not using for that.. right price .. right amount
"Good value, No issues."
Arrived fast and accurate
"Used for hot chocolate. Made of paper, so biodegradable. A++"
Bought these for an upcoming baby shower. Checked these prices against Walmart and BJs wholesale. Buying theses are a better value. They are very sturdy. I’d also rather use these cups than styrofoam coffee cups
"These cups are great for coffee, water, or any other beverage. I've let liquid sit in them for several days and never had one leak."
These are GREAT and a lot more affordable than buying paper cups from the grocery store/target/Walmart/etc. I’ll definitely repurchase these!
These are pretty sturdy and stand up well. Good Value too.
"Great paper cup for picnics and parties; no throwing away plastic. And I like that they are plain white, go with anything."
"great cups, I use them for hot tea"
Love love love paper products! Say no to styrofoam!
Great paper cups!
Great quality product
Good but not great
Used for wedding reception. Happy with purchase.
Perfect for entertaining large crowds. Do not come with kids
Good quality and size is not too big or small
Great good best
Very sturdy cup. Can be used multiple times for hot coffee.
Enjoy drinking my coffee from these cups.
Good cups. Durable and don’t leak. Would be a little better if they had lids with them. I think it’s a good quantity for the price. We use them in our office and no complaints.
Great cups and a nice way of not polluting our environment even further with plastic and Styrofoam crap that will never biodegrade. Will order again.
have ordered multiple times...
So much nicer than foam.
great size for my hubby's fiber drink every morning.
Love these cups!so comfortable
Good coffee cup
Great for office coffee break
The cups were hot to the touch with liquid in them. Recommend cup sleeves!
I use them for coffee. Good quality cup.
Excellent Product for my office
great paper cups
These cups are perfect for what i wanted them for! They are durable and just the right size!
Cups are great. Pretty sturdy. Hold a lot. Comes with a lot.
Very good quality
Good coffee cups
Good value
Great for hot coffee
Perfect for our office! No leaks.
"Love using these cups for my coffee at home , arrived in good form, and do their job effectively."
these cups hold liquid very admirably.
Pretty good value. Will order again.
They're cups!
WARM/HOT DRINKS - Serves it purpose.
Great
"Overall, these are pretty good cups. Since these aren’t waxed, they are better for the environment, but it’s sort of a trade off because it meant a couple of the ones we used at a birthday party leaked. We put stickers on the table and let the kids decorate their cups, and someone suggested that’s why the leakage, but we’ve since used them at home and had the occasional drip or ring from leaking at the seam. Like I said, a trade off for a cup that is compostable or recycleable if well rinsed."
"I bought these because of the good reviews. However, as my headline states, these are not insulated or lined. I have put cold liquid in them and after sitting around a couple hours, they feel damp. I see others mentioned they leaked. I didn't wait for that to happen and threw them out."
I LOVE THESE GLASSES. They are a bit on they pricier side but I love the quality and design of them. I just wish I could order more than 4 pc.
I made Mother’s Day cups for my sisters. Bought the lid & straw separately but the quality is perfect. & packaging was great
These glasses are worth it! I will be buying more. Thick glass. The mouth of the glasses are slightly imperfect but you can’t tell unless you are staring at it.
Super cute perfect for iced coffee definitely dishwasher safe I just wish they were a little bigger but other than that I really like them
"I’m obsessed! I was being super gentle with these when I first got them because I wasn’t sure how sturdy they were, but they’ve held up so well that i don’t worry about them at all anymore. Highly recommend"
"These glasses make me feel so fancy.! So smooth, I’m afraid to use the straws though lol"
I love these glasses. They feel a little in the thin side so I hand wash them. I’m sure they are dishwasher safe but I prefer to hand wash.
Glass is thick and strong. I even dropped a straw all the way to the floor and it didn’t bust.
"Absolutely love these glasses! Perfect for my morning coffee, lemon water, & iced matcha 💕 the aesthetic is so cute & trending right now. They are a tad wobbly but other than that you NEED"
"This set of glasses far exceeded any expectation I had. These are the durable, high quality drinking glasses. They come with thick glass straws and two tools to clean them. No doubt these will hold up well in the dishwasher. They were packaged nicely as well."
These cups are so aesthetically pleasing and really nice quality.
great quality and value love the straws too highly recommend
""
Don’t hesitate! These glasses are soooo cute and trendy. Anytime I use these glasses for guests I get compliments. Love that it comes with a straw cleaner. I’m not gentle with these and they have held up great. One of my favorite Amazon buys
Love these so much exactly what I wanted. Have held up to washing and falling over without breaking.
Loved these and the glasses are a lot thicker than I thought they would be… super cute
""
Exactly what I was looking for! The glasses and straws were in tact. I’m going to enjoy my daily cold brew so much more now! 10/10. Highly recommend!
Easy to clean and no more wasted straws
"Exactly what I wanted. Has held up well so far and actually holds quite a large amount of liquid! The straws come with cleaners to make that easier, but everything is glass (even the straws) so be careful! Super cute & aesthetic."
Trendy cute everything is positive
super quality!
The straw it’s so cool it comes with a brush to clean the straw. they look so pretty with a glass of lemonade
Sturdy glasses love the straws.
"Great material, thick enough and so fun to drink iced coffee with"
Exactly what I wanted
I love these and the glass straws are awesome!
""
"Super sturdy glasses and straws, aesthetically pleasing and heavily complimented whenever my friends come over!"
I love them they are so nice. They are exactly what the description says
"So far, very sturdy and easy to clean with the straw cleaner."
Love these! Have my morning coffee in them. Easy to clean and love the straws that come with! Packaging was great as well.
i love these cups and the straws
High-end drinking glasses; AMAZING quality; wrapped extra carefully!
Very nice product came packaged well and looks really nice.
Love these cups. A lot more sturdy then I thought they’d be. One of my straws came broken but otherwise perfect!
Good
I got for my iced coffee but use them for all my drinks
the best inlove with this glass cups
I have 2 left... my kids broke the other 2 just washing them lol other then that they're my favorite.
"another reviewer mentioned a piece of glass breaking off causing them to accidentally ingest. well, sadly the same thing happened to me today. as pictured, a large piece of the glass straw broke off while drinking an iced coffee. it was not discovered until the beverage was fully drank. ER visit later and x-rays could not find the glass lodged in my neck or the elsewhere. (esophagus pain since swallowing). dr advised my esophagus has likely been sliced while swallowing and should pain insist then an ENT needs to be consoled for an endoscopy while sedated. fingers crossed that is not necessary. awful experience — aesthetic glasses but do NOT recommend whatsoever. item needs to be removed from listing ASAP."
Although these cups are cute they are NOT safe I was drinking my soda out of this cup and I sucked up a piece of glass the glass had chipped off of the side of the straw. That could’ve led to an emergency.
"the glasses and straws are great - super aesthetically pleasing! unfortunately one of my glasses seems to have a very tiny hole on the bottom that allows some liquid to drain out :( I’ve only had the glasses maybe 2 weeks and have specifically tried alternating between all of them so that I don’t overuse one and have never dropped one. unfortunate because otherwise, they seem pretty sturdy"
Missing cleaning brushes! Didnt feel like going thru a return to repurchase (Option given) so just kept them…
Nice straw provided but the size was not what I expected. I photo will have to be resized to get a better idea of its actual size. Disappointed 😞
These are expensive glasses and they’re made so cheaply. They seem hefty but you can’t put the in the dishwasher or the sink. I put my in the sink and when it made contact with my sink it shattered.
""
"The glasses aren’t thick compared to what you see in videos , but there easy to clean"
Got my cups today! I love them but I only got 3 straws instead of 4…
The glasses themselves were beautiful but upon opening one of them was cracked (despite the packaging). I’m hoping to get a new one to replace the cracked one I received.
"I’m reviewing three items I purchased separately hoping they would work together as a set. They did!! These are dishes for my daughter’s new apartment that has very little cabinet space so her stoneware set is just too bulky. So I decided to pick up some Corelleware since it is durable, compact and lightweight. I really thought I would find some items that might “work” together, but never imagined I’d find EXACTLY the right shades of blue to match everything. I guess the Household Goods Gods were smiling on me that day!  #1 - Corelle 18-Piece Service for 6, Chip Resistant, Ocean Blues Dinnerware Set, These round plates and bowls have a modern yet playful rows of dots along the edge in three shades of blue including navy, periwinkle and teal. The plate itself is bright white. The bowls have a navy blue rim. (In the Amazon pictures it looks black, but it truly does look blue in person.) I have used Corelle dishes for over 30 years and my only complaint is that they last FOREVER! LOL! I mean I love a good value, but I it’s hard to justify spending $$ on “new” dishes when the ones you have still look as good as the day you bought them. Nonetheless, after buying these for my daughter, I am eyeing a new set for myself.  #2 Sweese 6210 Porcelain Fluted Mugs - 14 Ounce for Coffee, Tea, Cocoa, Set of 6, Cold Assorted Colors . Since the Corelle set did not come with coffee mugs, I looked for some blue ceramic mugs and found these beauties! And, I’m thrilled to report that they complement the Ocean Blues dishes perfectly! (See photo). These are stoneware coffee mugs with an elegant fluted side. The insides is white - not cream or beige. The white is not as bright as the Corelle dishes, but close enough. The mugs have a good weight to them - but not heavy or clunky. Of course they are not Corelleware, and will probably not hold up forever, but they seem to be sturdy to withstand normal use. The color I ordered says “Assorted” and it arrived very well packaged. Each mug inside a bubble wrap back and in its own compartment in a sturdy cardboard box. As I said, the colors go very well with Ocean Blues dinnerware. Only one mug appears a bit more green than blue - but it’s still in the blue color family. Overall, I LOVE these mugs and at about $4.50 each, they were a bargain!  #3 Cafe 20-ounce Break-Resistant Plastic Restaurant-Style Beverage Tumblers | Set of 16 in 4 Coastal Colors. To round out my daughter’s dish set, she needed cups for cold drinks as well. She is in college so I wanted unbeakable glasses - but not Tupperware-like plastic. I searched for acrylic drinkware and found these gems. I hadn’t planned on getting 16 cups, but at $1 each, I could not pass these up. They are exactly as their description reads - very much like the glasses used by little mom & pop diners- slightly bumpy texture on the outside with smooth rims and insides. Of course the BEST thing about them for me, was that came in shades of blue that coordinate so well with both the Corelle Ocean Waves and the coffee mugs! Seriously, these dishes look like I bought them as a set together. I really lucked out with these glasses - each in a different shade of blue that just happens to match the Ocean Blues. (Actually, one of the colors is really more of a smoky charcoal. I plan to keep those for my husband to use out in his workshop so he doesn’t keep taking my glass glasses out there.) These cups hold 20 ounces but don’t look or feel huge. After you add 6-8 ices cubes, you can pour a whole 12 ounce can of soda in the cup without it getting to over-flow level."
"Update #2: five (5) months in, only three of the cups remain.  Update: revised down to one star. Less than a month in, we've got five (5) that are cracked. They caused the cups to leak, so we had to get rid of them.They're not getting unusual wear--after use they are put in the kitchen sink until the dishwasher gets loaded. We have $0.99 character tumblers from the big box stores (the ones that are often sold near the party supplies) that have lasted years. These are a complete disappointment. When the first one broke, we got rid of it--i figured it was a fluke. Now I wish I had kept it, because I would have returned the whole lot had I known they were this prone to breakage.  Bottom line: these are a fair value in drinkware. BUT, If you are looking for plastic tumblers like those you find at restaurants, these are *not* those tumblers. These are thinner, and they break more easily. The first one of ours broke only a week after getting them. They also have rough edges along the rim--I've had to de-burr all of them so as not to risk any cut lips."
"Would normally not review general use items, because i dont like coming on here to say ""they are cups. They hold liquid i drink. would recommend"". But felt the need to clear some things up after reading other reviews.  These are break RESISTANT, not break PROOF. Imagine dropping your water RESISTANT phone into the deep end of the ocean and complaining that it no longer works after retrieving it 2 days later. I bought these because of the viral videos of people blowing one cup to another. I am not very good, but can tell you that these cups have not broken from regular use. I had one crack on me after i threw it in my sink half filled with water and it hit the edge of the metal sink, but i have had more expensive cups also break after doing the same thing. So that is on me, not the cups.  PS. Restaurant style doesnt mean these are higher quality. They just look like the cups at most restaurants. Because they most likely are. Cheap and durable. Theyre cups, and they a good job of being that."
"-- EDIT 4/30/2021 -- Over 1 year since I made this review. Every single cup is perfect. No cracks, discoloring, leaks or chips. I would buy these cups tomorrow in a heartbeat. I have them in a constant rotation with each cup being used multiple times per week.  I'm lazy. I bought these cups because I was fed up of hand-washing my 4 cup set of glasses every time I used them. So I bought a load of unbreakable acrylic cups that I could just put in the dishwasher and run it when I was ready.  Pros. The cups are sturdy. No flex, they wash well in the dishwasher (top shelf) and they have a pattern to them so they are easier to grip when wet. They stack, so they don't take up a ton of room in the cupboard. They are pleasantly colored. They are USA made. No chemical smell, no staining (with constant use for iced-tea) They are light.  Cons. I can't think of any, not even a small one.  I heartily recommend these cups. I've had the set now for a couple of months with absolutely no issues. No scratches from use or stacking, no cracks or chips and I've dropped a couple of them on to hardwood floors. I've used these mainly for iced-tea but I've also poured hot liquid (almost boiling) with no deformation in the shape or any failures.  This is my honest opinion. I paid full-price for the tumblers and received no discount or free product for my review."
"First, I want to mention what was said in another review. These cups are break resistant, not break PROOF. If you abuse them, they will break.  I have ordered these cups three times in the past, from a different site. I was happy to see them on Amazon. I have 25 years of restaurant experience, and these are better than the quality most places get. I liked my set so much, I have given them as gifts to every kid moving into their first place. Will the survive a two story drop? No. Will they survive your buddy Kyle dropping his Monster and Vodka? As long as he doesn’t do it if the second floor balcony, yes. They are decent cups for a decent price. Perfect if you have kids or are starting out. Or clumsy like me and break glass. I like them enough, I came back years later for more. My original set only has two left. Kids and a few years ruin everything. But the two left are still in decent shape."
"I have some large & small nice glasses but my grown kids kept asking what happened to the old plastic cups? I was skeptical about these restaurant style cups, but they get used all the time. I finally removed my ""nice"" glasses to a different cupboard. I am pleased that they have held their bright color through the dishwasher cycles and hard water we have. They stack very nicely leaving extra room in my cupboards for more ""stuff."""
Was looking to replace old cracked mixed design plastic cups with something new. I had been to stores and always gave plastic cups a squeeze test. Simply hold it my hand and give a moderate squeeze. I broke a half dozen cups that should Never have been for sale to consumers (and I swear - it was a medium grip. I wasn't trying to crush the cups). I don't feel bad about it. Those cups were Trash. These cups I purchased passed the squeeze test and have held up for a few months now. Not one crack. I'm very happy with these cups. And I have a cupboard full of quality cups of the same design. Would definitely purchase again!
"I have not experienced what some of the negative reviews have said so far. These appear pretty sturdy to me and I've had no issue with extra plastic around the edges. I hadn't even seen those reviews until I came back to write my own...I probably wouldn't have bought them if I had. I honestly was just lured in by the low price for a whole set of 16 cups--the way my kids go through cups in a day can get ridiculous! So far ours have held up well, and are also easy to wash. Although I have small hands, we had lots of cups that I had difficulty cleaning the inside of. But my hand easily fits inside these for washing. The colors looked really pretty online ,and coordinated with some other dishes I was buying at the same time--I was not disappointed upon seeing them in person. I don't have a ton of vertical space between shelves in my cupboards, but I can easily store these in stacks of four, which really helps save space.  I wonder if perhaps the company saw some of the negative reviews and decided to work on improving their product since then? Because I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"Bought these when I realized I didn’t have any non-glass glasses and a house full of teenage boys! 🤦‍♀️  Ordered these bc it reminded me of my childhood family Italian restaurant growing up. They’ve been perfect!  Different colors mean the boys don’t mix up their glasses. Dishwasher safe. Dropped and dropped again without breaking or cracking. LOTS of cups means don’t have to wash glasses every 5 seconds.  Highly recommend! Cheap, sturdy, practical."
I like that you can give these glasses five stars for being easy to hold. But there’s no way that you would ever get the fact that I have giant hands from that five star review. So let me lay this out straight for you.  Yes they are comfortable to hold. But for my giant hands I could say the same things about a damn paint can. I would give the paint can five stars as well.  So if you like the cups that they have at the diner as much as I do then you should buy these. But if you have ridiculously tiny hands you might want to head to the dine and try em out first. Cause I can not verify that the will be completely comfortable for you to hold.
I bought these because glass dust doesn’t work anymore I have a difficulty holding things but I have to drop these onto the tile floor‘s cement floors carpeted floors and it always bounces back I have not been able to break one yet but I will keep trying you’ll have a lot of success with these clothes they look good almost like glass when you see them in someone’s hand update September 2021 I moved to a new house I put these glasses into the dishwasher on the bottom rack and they come out looking like they should be used with the elephant man they were all distorted and melted I went back and re-read the description and it says top dishwasher rack which I’m sure is better because it’s less hot up there or less close to the heating element. Before I destroy them they were excellent glasses and enjoyed them very much I have a few left but it just won’t work in the current dishwasher I have so be careful but you’ll like them take care I hope this helps Keith
"I was waiting a little bit to write this review because some people were complaining aboiut various things. I wanted to see how the tumblers held up. You know: a lot of people whine online. I've had them for about a month now. I use them as water glasses every night. I alternate glasses since there are sixteen of them, and I put them in the dishwasher. These are great. Consider, they're roughly $1 a glass, but I find them sturdy, easy to hold, and they look great. Highly recommended."
"These are a huge throwback to those times when Pizza Hut used something very similar during the 80's and 90's to serve their frosty cold beverages. I bought these cups because of the nostalgia, rather as a parent who knows these cups can withstand a toddler's wrath and destructiveness. I don't need to worry about glass breaking everywhere and having to constantly replace them. Best of all, I can use these cups to actually train our child on how not to spill a beverage without worrying that this cup will be a victim to a tantrum. I have seen these cups be thrown against concrete, windows, furniture and take quite a beating without taking a nic or scratch. They look great, they feel amazing in the hand, they function well with any type of cold to lukewarm beverage and they last long.  I highly recommend these cups!"
"Very very fast shipping only 2 days! I read negative reviews about sharp edges around the mouth piece. Out of the 16 that I got only 3 were like that but just a few sharp edges but not the whole mouth piece. Just needs a little shave down NO BIGGIE! For the price its PERFECT! I haven't used these cups yet but I know for fact these are sturdy these are the same exact cups we use at my job but clear and it gets a lot of beating out of it with ice and refills over and over again. If I drop a cup yes it breaks sometimes but in my home I have never dropped my drinking cup. I love the colors beautiful. I got a set of each color. This is perfect for the 3 adults in my home, If you have young kids this may not work for you unless they are careful with things . I will test 1 cup out as of today and write back with update. The rest is for Christmas to myself along with new cookware and dishware. I can't wait! Hope this review has helped others to make their decisions...  Edit: 2 months later it's still holding up glad I got these very light and love the colors great addition to my set."
"I bought these for my teenagers to use in their rec area, and they are holding up very well to my boys. I usually don't like plastic drinkware, but the quality of these is very good. I've put them in the dishwasher numerous times; they wash well. Good product. Bought a second set for my older daughter who kindly takes the boys on weekends. It was the least I could do with her ceramic tile floors and formerly nice glassware. She is pleased as well."
"We love these cups! I have a big family, my husband, 5 kids, myself and my Dad constantly walks in and out of my kitchen with food or drinks (he lives right across the hall). Let’s not forget to mention the neighbors, godparents, sister, brother-in-law and their 5 kids! Phew...I’m tired just writing about it. Anyway, I definitely needed a generous amount of cups and BREAK-RESISTANT, very important when there’s little ones running around. The colors are gorgeous, girly colors, nice macho colors, and the best part of all they bring back happy memories of diners we’ve frequented in the past. I’m very happy with my purchase! I do admit...I count them at the end of the day just to make sure all are present and accounted for...sometimes one goes A-wall and ends up in my Dad’s house."
Very happy with this purchase.At my age (67) my hands tend to be a little wonky and my heavy glassware is heavy and slippery when wet😊.packed them away when I found these because plastic grocery store glasse.s are fine for barbecues but it’s nice to have an everyday alternative.wish I had taken a picture of the packaging because it was first rate.perfectly and cleanly packed snug in a new box.stacked nicely and individually. wrapped
"So far, so good, I have a family of 4. We were having issues with finding full glasses of milk all over the house with nobody taking the blame. I suspected it was my 9 year old but I didn't have proof. Finally I had enough of the waste and having cups strung all over the house. I ordered these cups and assigned everyone a color. I haven't had any issues since. Everyone really enjoys having their own glasses. The cups are well made, dishwasher safe and shatter-proof. What more could you ask for? I love my glasses. I put half of them in storage and only use 8. This is definitely the best $16.99 I have ever spent."
"Straight out the box, I looked them over because of other reviews. None were broken or cracked. I washed them, didn't see any plastic pieces. They seem just as sturdy as some older cups like this we have, which is why I ordered these. The colors are just as pictured. I plan on ordering another set. If anything chnages, I will update my review but these seem perfect to me."
"Exactly what I was looking for!! I wanted the cups that you get in family owned pizza shops so that when my teens have friends over, they can take to the dock or pool and I not fuse at them! I also wanted something that matches our beach decor and the colors fit perfectly. Good quality from just unpacking them, so hopefully they last throughout the use of 3 teens and friends. UPDATE: after a year, I ordered another set of these. I loved them so much that I downsized our actual glasses and replaced with these. They take a beating, do not stain with colored liquids, do not lose color or fade with use in the dishwasher and are easy to stack."
"Just received tumblers today 11/4/21. The colors are pretty and they are 20 ounces. I have children in my home often, and the breakage of glasses has been far too many even though they are teen and pre-teen. So I decided to invest in some inexpensive, colorful tumbers. They feel pretty sturdy and easy to hold. I am pleased with this purchase!!"
"They remind me of cups I see at restaurants. I have teenagers & their friends over frequently, they seem pretty indestructible. I like that they are dishwasher safe. We have a pool so they are perfect for the kids to take outside with them."
For the price you get a lot. Needed to replace almost every piece of drinkware in my cabinet and these did the trick. They’re perfect for everyday use and the perfect shape for better holding. They’re pretty much restaurant quality and confirmed dishwasher safe. Would buy again and the colors are nice.
"This is exactly what I was looking for!! I am so pleased with these cups. Now everyone in my family gets a color coded cup, so I don't have to wash a bajillion cups! (I have to handwash, because we don't have a dishwasher.) Oh speaking of, for those of you who DO have a dishwasher, maybe this is my error for not reading further, but the cups don't say on the bottom ""dishwasher safe"" on them, I noticed. If you DO plan on dishwashing them, I would maybe read a little better than I did and see if they really are dishwasher safe. I don't see why they would NOT be, they seem like restaurant quality, but I just happen to notice the lacking of that little phrase. Anyways, other than that, which is not a deal breaker for hand-washing ole me, I LOVE THEM!"
I got these for my children that either leave cups in their room for so long I just throw them away 🤢 or loose completely somehow. Cheaper than glass so I won't be as upset having to replace so much. More durable and affordable than single use plastic. Been through several dishwasher cycles in the top rack already. Still like new!
"I can't see any prospect of being injured by these drinking ""glasses,"" even though a few may have the tiniest of burrs on the lip. I wouldn't have even looked for this imperfection, except that I read a few reviews that did mention that. All of my cups arrived intact. It's an ideal number of stackable cups in an ideal size and I like the colors. These will not easily get broken at my house. We've been using them for almost 3 weeks and so far so good."
"These are what you would see at a restaurant or food service cafeteria. My only complaint is that I wish they were all one color instead of four blues, however I did not want red or brown and those were the only single colors available when I bought these."
Are they restaurant quality? No they are not. But for $20 you get a lot of cups and they don’t break when my 1 and 3 year drop them on the floor. Wash well in the dishwasher we only put them on the top rack hoping they will last longer that way. For the money you can’t beat em. The colors look great. We had them for a month and they are still functioning daily!
"I was hesitant to purchase these cups as I saw some reviews regarding the tops being rough. We purchased the 20 oz cups in the 16 cup set. The colors are pretty, the cups hold up great in the dishwasher and I haven't found a single one where the rim was not smooth. One of my favorite purchases because I use them everyday and for some reason they make me happy!"
Even though I was missing one cup and one was also broken this was well worth the money. I didn't contact anyone as I've been too busy with a newborn. 2 glasses are the least of my worries. The box came sealed not damaged. Thought it was weird a green one was missing then 2 days later noticed a huge crack in a blue one. But it's now almost two months later everyone has been through the dishwasher multiple times and man handled by an 11 year old as well as 35 year old and survived family holiday parties all while accidentally being dropped on the ground. I would say these are pretty durable
I bought these specifically because my kids tend to be rough with cups. They take them outside and drop them and in general just rough them up. These cups are fantastic! They take the abuse the kids dish out and then some. Dishwasher safe and easy to clean. The vivid colors look nice in the kitchen as well. I highly recommend if you’ve got rough little ones or teenagers who like to drag cups around everywhere!
"The wife and I were at Hooters and she remarked how much she liked their beverage tumblers. Searched and found these on Amazon, they are 2 ounces smaller than Hooters tumblers but that is negligible. I like the coastal colors and also that these are BPA free and dishwasher safe. Made in the USA is a bonus! Fast shipping and a good price."
"For the price they are great. They are better than I was expecting. Would they break if you dropped one on a cement/hard floor? Maybe. They'd probably crack at least, but I think a lot of plastic cups would too. The colors are the same as shown. Trying to wean the kids off water bottles and needed more plastic cups. Good size and if I needed more, I would not hesitate to buy more of these. So far none have broken and I have 4 older boys using them."
"I bought these cups for a house warming party. They are nice, hard plastic, not as thick as restaurant cups but perfect for parties. I do think they could possibly crack if dropped on a hard surface. All in all a very nice cup, pretty jewel colors, I really like them! Now I need to have another party to get more use of them!"
"We bought these because glass tumblers were not a good idea around our household--things get broken. This set offers a good variety of colors and there are plenty to ensure that everyone in our home, visitors or not, have a matching tumbler. They go through the dishwasher just fine, but they are not as thick as normal restaurant quality tumblers. They work for our needs."
I have a rental with 2 outdoor spaces and people kept breaking glasses. I wanted to eliminate glassware while maintaining a high level of quality in the tumblers. This does that and the variable colors make it so that each of my max 4 guests gets a different color! Exactly what I wanted for my rental house.
"I love these glasses! They're bright and remind me of the glasses some of my friends had when I was young. They're sturdy and wash well on the top shelf of the dishwasher. It's literally impossible to find these in 4-6-ounce size, and in bright colors. It seems everyone who carries them are constantly out-of-stock. I'll keep looking though."
"Great colors, wonderful for family, and overall good purchase. They are pretty sturdy but kind thin. We've had 2 break since we bought them but still they hold out with the abuse we put them through. I'm truly surprised they have made it this far without more casualties."
"First of all, I had been looking for affordable restaurant quality cups for months before finding this on the list of Prime Days deals. These cups are great, they make everything taste much better than standard plastic-ware and glass-ware cups. Since these cups do not alter the taste of water like my previous cups, I have been drinking a lot more water. It also doesn't alter the taste of soda, like my glasses do, so I drink just about anything that isn't a hot drink out of these. Everyone who comes over uses these cups instead of the old ones because they enjoy them just as much as I do. These are great quality cups and I am glad I bought them. I am never going back to any other kind of cup again!"
"Outstanding product! Pretty colors, wash up well and if dropped no cracking or shattering. Really a great option for families that use a lot of drinking glasses. I have been buying plastic ware glasses at stores and they don’t last or scratch up. These are sturdy, have a tiny texture that makes them nice to handle. Keeps drinks good and cold for a long time. A retro restaurant feel and look to them, glad I purchased these. All my old ugly glasses and plastic glasses are replaced by these. Very pleased that I have these as everyday glasses."
"The colors are great. My kids dropped their cups often enough, they don't crack. I've washed them in the washing machine at least 6 times now and they don't crack, discolor, scratch, or look any different than before I put them in. These cups do hold 16oz to the brim with no more room than that, in case that's important to anyone.  Yes, I would recommend these cups."
They shipped really fast I love these cups my kids loved these cups I've been dealing with problems with my children not wanting to drink from a regular glass and these have not been an issue in fact the bag for these so problem solved they fit in the cupboard very nicely they stack unlike regular glass glasses they don't break like a glass glass and they're pretty good size as well as weight so it doesn't tip over
I bought these to replace a smaller version of clear cups that I bought 20 years ago. These are very similar and I liked the old cups. These go through the dishwasher and look fine afterwards. I like the 20 ounce size too. The rough pattern on the sides make them easy to hold even when wet.
"I used these for several weeks - daily. We washed them in the dishwasher - top rack AND bottom rack. The color remains vibrant and the plastic appears the same as the day we unpacked them. Terrific quality for a household staple for people who practically live outdoors in Texas. Life with a pool demands plastic glasses instead of disposable paper, plastic or cardboard products."
"These are really sturdy and light weight. You get a lot of them and they are nicely priced to replace when the kids ""lose"" them. You get a lot with the order and it is just a really good deal."
* update! I contacted the seller and they sent me a whole new set. I would have been happy with just the one cup they definatly went above and beyond* I was so excited to finally throw away all those crappy little kid cups. I was incredibly disappointed to find one cup has a hole it it. It is the wildest thing
"Got these to replace my son's kid cups, so he could keep using plastic but they were bigger. We all ended up using them because they are so convenient. I have washed them in the dishwasher for months and they have held up very well. Highly recommend!"
"I like the colors, the style and the fact that these tumblers have a flat bottom. After dishwasher is complete there is no residual water on the bottom of the tumbler making it easy to just put them away. I can also add a lot of ice cubes and a 12oz coke without any problems. I bought the 16 pack and feel I'm set for a long time."
"These cups are great! It was hard finding the right size I wanted. This seller did a great job describing how many ounces these cups hold. These make great Ice Tea cups, soda too! Will be using this seller again in the near future! Also a very fast shipper as well!"
these dont break easily even when dropped on tile or wood floors. fit in the top of my dishwasher. this size is much sturdier than the 32 oz ones and they dont fit in the top of the dishwasher FYI! i ended up getting 2 sets of this size and we use them all the time now.
"Just what I was looking for. Sturdy, attractive, and inexpensive. Perfect for the back porch in summer without worry of leaving out the best glassware.  Others have mentioned the slightly ""sharp"" edges and mold mark on the bottom, but I think they've significantly exaggerated them. I don't see any risk of injury here, it's just not as smooth as some might like. If it bothered me, I'd just take a bit of fine-grit sandpaper to the edges, but nobody in my family has complained so I'm content to use them as they are."
I purchased these because my four kids kept dropping and shattering my glass cups. I was tired of buying glasses all the time. These hold up and clean so well! They look nice too :) I got the blue cups. Definitely recommend.
"Just what I was looking for. Cheap, cute, light-weight, and kids can’t break them. We were ready to upgrade from kid cups but not quite ready for glass and these were perfect!"
I don't know what people are looking for in a plastic cup(referring to other reviews on these) but these are EXACTLY as stated. They are like the old school red ones from pizza hut. I kept the red ones for years but they have slowly disappeared so I bought these to replace. These are identical. Except prettier colors. Plastic cups if dropped will break people. Jeesh.
If you prefer the restaurant cups you get when you are out these are the cups for you. They are very sturdy and easy to clean. The size is perfect. Not to big and not to little. I chose the colored glasses to help hide some of the scratches you will get over time. The color was consistent and I couldn't find and imperfections. Nice quality and packaging was great.
"I read like them, except for the ridges inside on the bottom that could be hard to clean if something dried on it, like milk or something. Why is that even there? And it sometimes hurt my fingers to wash them... wish they were just smooth."
I ordered these glasses because I have arthritis in my hand and cannot use heavy glasses. These are very lightweight and they are durable too. I am very happy with my purchase!
Kids broke half out glassware being kids. Got these as a safer alternative. They look like something from a local restaurant and can confirm they survive a fall to tile floor. Very durable and aren't embarrassing if you have company over.
"These are great tumblers and last for years. Nice size and don't tip easy. I have 4 clumsy children and tile floors, and my last set lasted for 3 years before needing to replace with these. Was excited to see they had different colors to choose from this time around, love the coastal colors! Hoping these last us another 3+ years ~"
"6 kids at home ranging from 18 months - 15 yrs, plus 4 more grown that bring their kids, we're all about durable products! Love that I was able to find these great colors! Awesome pricing too!"
Sturdy cups nice to drink from held up well in top rack of dishwasher but one got ever so slightly warped in the dry cycle when on the bottom rack. They’re a good size to hold as well and easily fit a whole can of soda.
This is actually my second set because my daughter saw the 1st set & fell in love. I had to lie & say I get them for free so she'll take them & I bought me some more & thinking about buying more..
"There is nothing wrong with these tumblers...they are exactly as described. However, every single tumbler is individually wrapped in a plastic bag, nestled in the other cups. While I understand it was probably 'necessary' to protect the finish on each cup, in my cupboard they are stacked directly on each other. It just seems like excessive packaging."
"Love these so much. With a busy household these are perfect. I don't worry about them breaking if they get turned over, they can be stacked, and are attractive to look at."
"These are restaurant style plastic cups, so durable and a good size. They've held up fine in the dishwasher. We have a restaurant style cup dispenser in our kitchen for which I bought these, and it's working well. The colors are nice too."
"I shared with my grown kids and had to laugh when they brought them out for a firepit cookout last nite. Bragging about them to all their friends saying remember these red ones from Alfies pizza and the green from some other fav hangout when they were younger. (insert snort here as they are all very early 20's) Anyway point is they love them as do I. Durable, evidently nostalgic, great colors and we dont worry about the little ones 2 and 4yr breaking them and getting hurt."
With a family of four I was finding by the end of the day there were 30 different cups in the sink. I bought these cups and assigned every one their own color and they were responsible for using their own color and washing when done...and that problem was solved. I have had to catch myself running up stairs to collect MY red cups because they were no more and making me live my own rule. The kids love it!
These r great needed cups for sure. They always disappear. So these are the perfect ones to get. Aren’t expensive plastic and colorful so if you end up missing one cuz someone takes it home well it’s not that big of a deal.
My boys like to take cups from the house & we needed something sturdy that was inexpensive & still good quality. These are prefect for on the go beverages!
"Bought these out of nostalgia remembering eating at Pizza Hut in the 80s (they had red ones). So glad I did! These are fantastic and as my husband likes to point out, you don't need to use a coaster. The outside stays dry. Love the coastal colors!"
"I consistently buy these for my offices. I find that the size is good for Keurig brews - leaves a little room for additions without encouraging a double k cup brew. Not the best for keeping drink hot, or keeping fingers cool, but better than paper cups. I hate styrofoam so this is a good alternative. I also like that it comes without lids. You want a to-go cup, bring it from home. In a busy office of sometimes broke salespeople, these fill a need without encouraging excesses that cost me unnecessary money. Also, forgotten cups don’t tend to leak within hours as I’ve seen with other cups. I’m cheap but not stupid."
Super great at pouring coffee into my mouth. Amazing! Even works on other liquids or even powders if you dare! I felt like a new person with this technology. I used to cup my hands and pour coffee but these cups...game changer. I honestly am still using the first one so I have 999 more times the pleasure still in the box. If you wash them you could probably get a whole year out of one cup and you’d have like 1000 years of this technology if you are diligent. Love you cup makers
"We've been buying this brand at the Big Box stores, but lately they haven't had them. I was thrilled to find them at Amazon. We use these in a home office so buying 500 cups at a whack isn't a problem. This should hold us a while and save us the trouble of shopping around. Will definitely re-order when we open the last pack. They're a great cup for hot or cold drinks. You won't burn your hands or have to fool with a cardboard sleeve."
"I really like these cups and the matching lids. They don’t fall off the cup like some, but they’re not hard to remove either. I’ve dropped a cup with the lid and very little drink spilled out through the little hole. They rarely have a lid that cracks, and I’ve found that the cups are sturdy enough for at least two refills. They make good hot or cold cups in my opinion. The textured side is less slippery than plastic cups for cold drinks. I have yet to find a better combination of features in a cup and lid."
"Been using these cups for my coffee for years. I generally use one a day for multiple cups of coffee. Sometimes by the fourth cup, you can tell it is getting a little saturated around the bottom seal but it is just paper after all. If Dixie keeps making these to the same standards, I will continue to buy them as long I drink coffee. :)"
"These work very nice for really hot beverages, the fingers do not get burned. I bought another brand and the heat transferred to the fingers and was way too hot coming now I do not use the other brand. Do not be worried that they are a little more expensive then some others because these are very nice, I think you will be happy with them."
I use it for hot coffee. Retains the heat and doesn’t burn the fingers while holding it. Terrific insulation. Couldn’t ask for anything more.
We have found that our AirBnB guests use the cups much more often than the lids and stirrers than come in the combo packs we have previously bought. So we were stuck with extra of those and no more cups. It was nice to find a bunch of cups-only at a good price. They do the job.
"We have been using these cups for over ten years and normally purchase at Costco in bags of 170 cups and always at a discount when they were (rarely) put on sale. A few years ago, the cups in two of the bags had a leakage problem with the seal in the bottom of each cup. The hot liquid was seeping through the base. Costco refunded the purchase price in full. That was the only issue we ever had over the course of using many thousands of the cups.  This purchase through Amazon was made because we were running low and Costco had not had the items sale priced in a considerable period of time. So, after looking online, we came across the Amazon offering at a very good price. We purchased two cases of 500 cups each. These are the identical cups to those purchased at Costco.  However, the first few sleeves (25 cups per sleeve) that we used have a defect in which the hot liquid seeps through the cup's side seam. Note that it is possible to use the cups for a serving before the seepage begins. However, when a refill is desired, the seal breaks down and it becomes necessary to place the cup inside another. This is not a major issue for us but we feel it needs to be reported."
I use these coffee cups in my hair salon for our guests. I couldn’t find them anywhere. Amazon always comes through.d
"These worked great for a coffee festival that we were at. The time it took to get them delivered took longer than we were told, but thankfully they ended up coming in before the festival."
"These insulated cups are slightly thinner than the older style (the brown and white color scheme) cups but still get the job done. I like these as they are just about the right size for my morning coffee. They comes shipped in a large box with the cups having little protection other than the box so don't be surprised if a few cups get crushed. I only had this happen to about 3 cups (nothing serious, just dented lips) as my box appeared to have been dropped.  Regardless of this these are still the best deal around for this size/type cup so I will buy them again."
"Solid to-go cups. I’ve had plenty of mornings where half asleep I rolled out of the house with my to-go cup of coffee just to have it drop on me all the way to work. These cups won’t do that. These are a bit more expensive, but it will save you the headache of a leak. Recommended."
I have used for the last two or three years for my coffee & additional hot beverages bar. The 12 ounce w/lids are great with my Keurig machine.
Love these cups. I was working for Georgia Pacific help to develop the artwork of the cup. perfet touch is exactly what it is. Never burn your hands again!
I've yet to have one of these cups leak. Have been using these for over 4 years.
"These are the best disposable cups for hot beverages. The are comfortable to hold, and paper is more pleasant to drink from than Styrofoam. Also, the 8-ounce size is ideal for receptions and other gatherings. If you offer a larger cup, people tend to fill it beyond what they can drink, and the excess winds up in the trash can."
"Great cups, have used them for years."
"The perfect cup is you enjoy 2 cups of coffee in the morning. These hold as much as a large mug or two cups. Well insulated, attractive design, great for guests too."
"Been using these cups for years, my coffee just tastes better in them, became a placebo now. Super sturdy if you want to reuse also."
Perfect for the coffee bar in the office. Hold beverages well- keeps them warm and is a sturdy durable cup.
"Great coffee cups. When paired with the lids I purchased at the same time as these I love them. I use them daily in my hotel and they work great, very little heat transfer to your hand. If you need alot of cups you can't go wrong with these. Be careful when ordering. You have to pay attention to the size that you order. Not all lids fit all sizes of cups."
All good!
These cups are well made and insulated enough that even the hottest liquid is not too much for the comfort of holding the cup.
They are better than the description
"Luxurious. Discovered these at work, now buy them for my home"
Good product.
Great sturdy cups that keep hot coffee hot and cold drinks cold.
Like the sturdiness and durability
Been buying these cups in bulk for years on Amazon w/o lids. Perfect at only 13 cents per cup - great deal. The case lasts for a couple of months. Not one complaint yet.
Good product price good
Good but I need less quantity However this brand of cups I used to get from Costco  It’s great
Sturdy - Expensive - Worth It
good product and price
These cups will last me a long time. It's a good buy for me to purchase in bulk since I depend on Amazon Prime for all my dry goods & non perishables since an auto accident left me semi disabled. I rinse these cups when I'm done and they go straight to the paper recycle bin.
This is exactly what was expected and as described. Will buy again
good
"Great price, quality and will keep me stocked for awhile."
Awesome cups for coffee to go in the morning. But...this product does not come with lids. Don't forget to order the lids.
As expected
Exactly what I needed for my purposes. The insulation is great - these do not need another cup or a sleeve to protect the user's hand from heat. This is the size I prefer for a large group. Almost none of my local stores have the 8-oz cups.
These are exactly what I expected and cheaper. They are like the ones most of us have seen in restaurants and coffee shops. The cost per cup/cover in this bulk is significant and identical to the smaller packs I find in the grocery store. I bought both the cups and covers.
Holds 16 oz . Strong material Does not squash
I bought open items to save money.. The cups are good. But there were only 18 rolls instead of 20 rolls. 50 cups were missing.
great size for our sunday school class coffee bar. same doesn't carry this size. was glad to find this on amazon. saved some $ by finding this size too!
Me fueron muy útil
good product
"Our customers Love this Hot Cup!! You should try this for your customers, the cup feels good in your hand. It is a great feel and a great way to keep the Hot Drinks Hot for your customers. The Price per case of 1000 cups is unbeatable. I did not find a better deal anywhere. I will be back for my next order. Thank You Amazon!"
Super cups
Perfect hot cup. Well insualted. Can drink two cups before the bottom starts to thin. Wish it was tiny droo cheaper.
"It took a few more days than promised, but the quality is good and as expected."
My husband really enjoys his coffee cups!
As expected
These cups are always sturdy and worth the money.
"Yes, this is the main reason I use paper cups. They are beautifully designed and are appealing to the eye."
"Tried many cups for office. These work best, no tipping or bending."
"best value pack around. good cups with imbedded texture on the outside so no need for a heat barrier sleeve. these are great cups and at this price a great value. no cover included, but you can buy separately."
"Good cups for our event center, at a good price. You don't need sleeves for them as they don't get too hot, and it's a good size (not too big, not too small). The design on front is a nice addition."
We use these cups in our cafe and they are great. No need for a paper sleeve.
quality of cup is high but so is price
"While this is what I ordered, I was hoping, like my previous order, that the cups would be the horizontal stripe with the butterfly on it. Maybe next time......"
We use these at church for hospitality. They work very well. Not too hot on the fingers.
Love these. Go through a lot of them. They keep coffee warmer than a cold regular coffee cup and does not add to the dirty dishes.
like
Best paper cups we've found on the market. We buy them for our church services...case at a time (1000 cups).
"Use at our church. Just wish Sam's club, etc carried the 10 oz. Only carry 12 oz."
"The cup does not need a sleeve protect your fingers, lids fit good no leaks, classy look, price is right."
Would gladly purchase again.
Great cups!
Great cups. Don't burn my hand and feel warm and fuzzy. lids that match them fit perfectly with not spilling (as long as you don't hold them sideways :-))
"Needed some average size plastic tumblers that didn’t look like cheap plastic cups. These are perfect size, easy to hold and wash well in the dishwasher. Was concerned they may show wear since they are slightly transparent. It’s been a couple months and they still look new. Everyone typically reaches for one of these cups when making a beverage."
"I love the look of acrylic - but my favorite set got ruined over time. I bought this set to save a few from the old set (different brand) that were still in good shape. After being through a set of Acrylic glasses that I had for 20 years, I learned: Do not put in the dishwasher. Do not wash in hot water. And do not go through extreme temperature changes quickly with Acrylic. (hot to cold/cold to hot) Also, use SOFT sponges for cleaning - Acrylic scratches. If you do this - they will last for years on end. : )"
My whole family loves these cups. The colors are gorgeous and the look like glass even though they're plastic.
"We LOVE these! We got them so everyone in the family can have a dedicated color so everyone can use a water glass all day and not get them mixed up. They are nice and big, easy to hold, nice mouth feel while drinking, and as you lift the glass to your mouth, the brilliant hue fills your vision with a pop of fun color! They're really fun to drink from! The colors are just as pretty as they look on the screen. So excited about these!"
Very surprised at how good quality the cups are. Very sturdy
"We looked quite a while for large cups that were dishwasher safe. These are great. Good colors, large size to hold an entire can of soda + ice. Great customer service from the seller, too."
"I had to get new everyday tumblers that were a little smaller/shorter than what I had. My new fridge's water dispenser is in an awkward place and my previous cups were just a bit taller which hit the water button when trying to get ice button behind it. Water all down the front of the fridge, on the floor.....total disaster. These cups are the answer to that problem. Just perfect to get to the ice without triggering the water and the difference in ounces isn't really noticeable. The colors are so vibrant and pretty. The etched diamond shapes are a plus making them very attractive on my table. I love them and am so glad I purchased."
"They’re very well-made they’re heavy but not in a bad way, the colors the colors are gorgeous they’re clear they handle well I am so happy with them they were just what I was looking for I’m sure you’ll be happy with them to"
"Good ""mouth feel"" meaning the part you drink from is a good thickness but not too thick, and it is rounded over, not sharp or square. I have washed these many times in the dishwasher (top rack) and none have cracked.  Only downside is there is a little reservoir on the underside of the cup, where water will pool from teh dishwasher if you put them in upside-down and straight up and down."
"Beautiful in person. Everyday use for a month and still look great, will update in a year. Lightweight. Only minor thing is in dishwasher water collects when they are upside down in rack."
It was nice to buy colored acrylic glasses that don’t sweat like real glass here in North Carolina. Also the reason why I got the special jewel colors was to match the beautiful pattern on my new dishes that had flowers. The glasses and the dishes match very well and I am very happy with my product and Amazon.
I absolutely LOVE everything about these cups. My 6 years old thinks she’s a big kid like her older siblings when she drinks from them and I don’t have to worry about them breaking. I’m very satisfied.
"Just what we were looking for. They look like colored glass, but if you drop them they bounce. After a number of trips through the dishwasher, they still look new."
"I bought these glasses because we needed new glasses and because of a physical limitation my husband tends to drop items. So, I needed plastic glasses. I also have small hand and larger glasses I have difficulty holding. These are just the right size. They come in 2 sizes and hold plenty of liquid."
I needed sturdy but inexpensive cups for children and these work. They seem like they are a little thin but not too bad. They are very pretty. I've used them for a few months and they are holding up very well.
"It was time to migrate from my collection of stadium and BBQ cups to more dignified, yet still fun cups. Mission accomplished."
"We like everything about these cups. They are lightweight, easy to hold. We hand-wash ours, not sure dishwasher would be good for them in the long run. Trying to extend their life."
"I wanted a smaller glass for everyday use. This set came in assorted beautiful jewel tone colors. They taper down, so with the arthritis in my hands, they are much easier to hold.. Dishwasher safe. The only downside I have seen is they sweat when full of ice and a drink."
Nice size. I like them.
"These tumblers are colorful, a nice size, sturdy, and easily washable."
We purchased these for use outside on the cement patio because we didn’t want to worry about broken glass. These tumblers are sturdy and a great size. The colors re beautiful and the assorted colors makes it easy for guests to remember which tumbler was theirs.
These glasses are sturdy and colorful. Great size. Easy told hold. Came carefully packaged and all in one piece. Loved them. May buy a 2nd set to make sure we have plenty!
"Jewel tone colors are beautiful - love the glasses as they are easy to clean and easy to hold the drinks. Even if someone drops them, they do not crack or break - very good deal."
"These are great so far, just what I wanted. Come out of the top shelf dishwasher sparkling clean. Nice size for ice water or iced tea. Pretty deep colors. Would recommend."
"These products are fine, and the description is not at all misleading. There's even a diagram in the listing that shows what the 20oz. full line would be. The colors are pretty and since these are made in the USA I don't have to worry about shady unregulated chemicals in the plastic poisoning me."
Great Buy! I’m Obsessed With These Cups! I Love Everything About Them.
"They are so pretty for summertime & Spring. Great for outdoor patio entertaining. No worry of broken glass and hold just the right amount of any drink. Also, very sturdy and easy to hold."
"I like these, the colors are vibrant and pleasing contrast well with my dinnerware. Not so huge that you cant find enough beverage to fill a house full of guests, would buy again"
These tumblers remind me of the hand blown glasses made by Gabriel Glass. They are rare and collectable.
"These glasses are pretty, durable and made in the US. Only wish I could order in specific colors and not the variety pack to go with my kitchen décor."
This set of cups remind me of the set my grandmother had when I was a kid. Except These have more beautiful colors. Perfect for summer or anytime!
"Stackable, vibrant colors In a great size. No more arguing over whose drink it is, just pick your color.I have had mine over a month and they still look brand new!"
"These are great glasses, they do hold more than 16 ounces! They are lightweight adorable, and are perfect for iced tea! Very reasonably priced."
"Attractive durable, easy to hold glasses"
great item love them
I love everything about these tumblers! Everyone can have a different color and not get them mixed up. The are elegant enough to serve to company instead of heavy glass that can break. They hold plenty of fluid and are very sturdy.
"I bought these tumblers for occasional use on my back deck, but they're so pretty and durable that we use them almost every day. They still look like new, even going through the dishwasher several times. The larger capacity is great for our protein shakes, which don't fit into regular sized glasses. I'm tempted to get rid of my glassware and just use these as our everyday drinkware."
"Large capacity, great for the pool"
Definitely worth the $$ and very colorful
"Nice quality and durable. Put in dishwasher and are fine. Colors are nice. Good for every day use, especially with kids in the house!"
"Great product, very lightweight"
"Mainly got these for the little man. Really nice looking, perfect size...even for adults. No complaints."
Have only had these for a month or less but like them and use them all the time. Wanted something for entertaining outside and on the porch. A perfect size for lots of ice.
"I like the colors, Typical plastic grade cups, Not sure how long they will look good seem like they might scratch easily"
Use daily for more than a year and wash in dishwasher. Great quality and durability. Comfortable in hand. Easy to use.
Excellent product ready for summertime beverages. Taste even better seeing they are made in the USA..
These were just what I wanted! Pretty and practical! Good size. I love the colors!
I bought these to replace my breakable glass tumblers. They hold a lot fluids and are easy to clean. The only thing if put into the dishwasher the bottom will hold water. Other than that we enjoy them.
I’ve had them for a few months now. I love them. Perfect size for me and so pretty.
These are very pretty and lightweight. Nice to look at. Nice to hold.
"I love these! Very sturdy, durable and dishwasher safe! I will buy more!"
I like the vibrant colors and the texture of the cup. They are very easy to clean.
My family loves these glasses. They feel well made and they are very pretty
Durable quality with excellent color perfect for those summer days
"These are substantial and beautiful. The bottoms have a rim that can collect water when washed, if that may be an issue for some people, but the design reflects the light beautifully and to this point they are shiny and crystal clear. They make whatever you are drinking taste better."
I have used these for less than a week so I can’t rate them for durability but I love how they look. Nice size for a glass of iced tea.
Just the bright spot of color is fun to have a drink
"These cups are better in person. The colors are sharp,and feel great to hold. Plus MADE IN THE USA!!!!!"
"practical, beautiful and safe. Just love them."
"teenage friendly, great value. love the colors."
It’s like a party in your cup cabinet!
"Attractive set of everyday cups, east to clean, very break resistant ."
"Love the color of the cups, couldn’t find the pretty colors in the store. Easy to clean and hold. And very durable also. You can stack 2 together for more room in your cabinets. Also not a bad price!"
nice cups - sturdy and easy to clean! Would buy them again!
Very easy to clean. Colors are brillant.
Not well made and too small.
Works for what you need just don't drop it
I love that these glasses come in 8 different colors. The purple is my favorite. Packed well. Arrived quickly.
Nice plastic glasses.
"Wow was it time to update my plastic glassware! These were perfect, right size, durable, colorful & easy to clean!"
"These ""glasses"" are sturdy, large, and high quality. I've also washed them once on the top rack of the dishwasher just fine. Just be aware that because they don't taper as much as other brands, you will need more space to stack them (they go about 1/2 into each other) and they tend to stick together a bit more than others i've owned. You will need at least 10.5"" of height to stack two glasses. I just happen to not have that much height in my cabinet. I'm not downgrading my review of them or anything, but it might be helpful for some of you that have limited storage as i have. Stackability never even entered my mind."
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I LOVE these! They look EXACTLY like glass and are durable; I’ve washed them multiple times on both the top and bottom racks with no issues. They are still clear - absolutely no signs of “murkiness” that other plastic cups sometimes get after being washed. They haven’t warped or changed shape either. I wish that these came in other sizes because they’re great! They aren’t stackable and are definitely taller than what I would consider the average kitchen shelf height. They’re a little larger in circumference than most cups; if you’re hands are President Trump-size or smaller, holding these securely in one hand will be problematic. I would prefer that they be a little less in diameter but considering how great they look and their durability, this is only a minor concern. I looked very carefully before purchasing these because I wanted the appearance of real glass but without having to worry that if “sip happens” and one should fall, it would shatter all over. However, from my past experiences, it’s been difficult to find a plastic that doesn’t warp when placed in the dishwasher or start to appear cloudy when exposed to heat. So far, these have been nothing but perfect in terms of meeting my requirements.  These are great and I highly recommend them - I hope that they have more options in the future that include a smaller size (maybe a 20 ounce capacity...?) that is not as difficult to hold due to its circumference. Overall, you won’t find a better set of cups when trying to find an alternative to glass at a decent price."
"Very impressed with these acrylic glasses! Purchased both sizes. I’ve went through a lot of acrylic glasses because I hate hand washing dishes. I put everything in the dishwasher. I have to say I’m so impressed with these. In the picture that glass has been washed 12 times so far on top rack dishwasher. Looks just as good as when I received them. Like I said, I’ve purchased many others over the years. Some, way more expensive. They usually end up with marks, cracks, film color etc. so far not these. With how they are holding up thus far, I highly recommend them."
Good tumblers for a clumsy old man. Tumblers feel good in my hand. These plastic glasses do tend to show water spots after cleaning in our dishwasher whereas glass tumblers do not. These hard water spots are not a significant problem.  Update: I bought 6 more
"I love these cups. They really do look like glass. They are simple and classic in design. I don't have to worry about my kids breaking them. They have held up great in the dishwasher. Also they are wide enough for ice cubes. If you drink a lot of ice water you know what I mean. Glasses that are too narrow, the ice cubes kinda hinder the flow of water and then slip towards when you tilt your head a little more. You need a wider cup. I can't explain the physics but it's always the case. These are the perfect width of you love your ice!"
"Just like my other review on the 16"" ones, these are exceptional! I bought these to replace identically-sized glass ones that I have become an absolute expert in smashing at the most inopportune times. Not with these! These are great!! Unlike the 16"" ones though, these are perfectly clear, not with a slight hint of colors like the others. I like that!  And speaking of... when ordering these, I thought they were gonna look like cheap replicas of my glass ones... you know... plastic with that 'nub' on the bottom that came from how they were made? Well not these! These feel like premium glassware... just not glass! Honestly I was only expecting the former, and had ordered it as such and would've been completely fine with that had it been the case, so imagine my surprise when these completely exceeded my expectations! These are so nice I wouldn't mind putting these out on a fancy dinner table. Yes, they are that nice.  Definitely going to order more once I perfect the art of efficiently breaking my remaining glassware in the dishwasher."
"These cups were purchased to replace some that had started cracking that I bought at Target a couple of years ago. Based on some helpful reviews, we will only be washing these new cups in the dishwasher in the top shelf only in hopes they will last longer. There are 8 of us using these at home so they get washed quite frequently, I'll update my review after a couple of months to let everyone know how they are holding up.  ***UPDATE AFTER USING OVER 1 MONTH*** These cups have been getting heavy use by our family of six and many washing on the top shelf of the dishwasher and I can report they all still work and look like new!  ****5 MONTH UPDATE****** My family is still using these cups and washing in the dishwasher usually at least once per day and some of the larger cups are starting to break down. Once has a large crack in the top and the other is deforming a bit (almost looks like it melted a little on the rim)."
"Awesome size and feel! Substantial, yet very lightweight. I do not like glasses that are too large in diameter; these are a breeze to hold for small to average adult-sized hands. Wrapped individually, and well packed - no wiggle-room. I seem to always grab the cheap plastic glasses we receive as freebies with a beverage purchase, because they are so lightweight; these however, are SO MUCH nicer. Great for entertaining - look like glass. Especially for outdoors and children. Also like that the larger of the two is not quite as big as those in most glass sets. I rarely finish my water at mealtime, and this is the perfect moderate size. I was quite pleasantly thrilled with these. FYI, I was asked to review these for reimbursed of purchase, but I’m NOT computer literate and have not been able to set up a paypal account that Amazon can access. So it is quite probable that I won’t actually get reimbursed (MY fault) - and yet I’m so happy with the purchase that I don’t even mind. Now I can’t live without!"
OMG these are exactly as I had hoped they would be. Maybe even better. WE LOVE THEM! The size is fabulous. I am trying hard to drink tons of water each day and these hold so many oz. you just dont realize that you have had MORE than in any other large glass (most glasses are nowhere near 24 oz).  We also got the 9 oz for our bathroom cups and to drink wine outside on our back deck (so we weren't risking breaking glass out there).  These look great and keep up well - we have had them for several months now I believe.  The info that came with them said top shelf dishwasher only - so we have been diligent about that - dont know what would happen if they get put on the bottom shelf.  Also a little tip - they come out of the dishwasher a bit wet (when other things are dry) and I just leave them on the counter for a little bit before stacking them and putting them away - they finish drying very fast. And look nice and clean - no streaks. If I had any reason to buy more of these I totally would - that's how much we love them.
"They are exactly what you expect - very large, tough ""glasses"". Empty they feel like plastic. They are surprisingly clear like glass. There is a slight ridge at the top of the mold. True glass-makers heat the top to smooth that out. You will hardly notice it. It's not rough or would cut you or anything. Full of liquid, they are indistinguishable from glass unless you clink two together. They have the same smoothness and weight. I haven't scratched or melted them in the dishwasher yet either. I have a feeling that they will outlast all of my similar looking glass glasses. Highly recommended."
"I was in the need for new acrylic (plastic type) cups since my older ones were getting scratched. I initially purchased a set from the big warehouse club store and they have served me well. However, over time they got ""foggy"" or scratched up from normal use. The main reason I use acrylic cups:  1. We don't use glass cups outside of the kitchen/dining room. 2. Our kids use these style cups for the bathroom when they brush their teeth. 3. Sometimes they want water late at night...if we drop these cups it's an easier clean up vs a glass cup. 4. We can use these in our backyard/pool area...again, safer than using glass.  I decided to purchase from US Acrylic, because these cups were BPA free and the simple design was what I was looking for...I was very satisfied when I received my set, but as things can happen..one cup was cracked! Fortunate for me, US Acrylic contacted me and asked if everything was okay. I informed a customer representative that one item was broken. I sen them a photo to show proof, but before I could send the photo they already sent me a replacement! It is very hard to find great customer service, but if you are looking for a company that stands behind their product...don't hesitate from buying from this company!  P.S. Don't expect them to last forever or stay clear...if they go in the dishwasher or are dropped from time to time, they will get scratched! My old set from a different company lasted around two years before I got fed up with the scratches (they were still usable btw). The trade off here is the safety of these cups not breaking like regular glass! We don't wear our shoes in our home, so minimizing broken glass is important!"
These are the perfect size and shape to keep you hydrated without having to run back and forth all day for refills. they look very nice in a place setting but hold up to my grandchildren and my big dogs with the big bushy tails that like to knock things over! The top could be finished smother...but it isn't noticeable when you are drinking. But if you run your finger along the edge you can feel it.I was surprised at the packing. The only packaging was each glass was wrapped in a thin plastic bag. The box was pristine when it arrived so my glasses were in perfect condition. But I couldn't help to wonder how they would have held up at the bottom of a shipping container or if they were dropped handles a bit roughly in transit.
"These are so beautiful. Great clear tall glasses that are somewhat impervious to my son's clumsiness. He has broken most of the pretty things in the house now that he no longer has control of his limbs during puberty, so I wanted a solution that will work for our clear glass desires. These are very, very clear but do not use any type of sponge with scouring pad on it. It just gets foggy due to scratches. I knew this but what can you tell teenagers. Now they want mine but I made sure to mark the bottom. Ha! Great gift idea for parents with similar issues I promise you!"
"I have had difficulty holding glasses properly for the last few years due to a medical issue. Finally broke two glass glasses in one day (old restaurant DuraTuff!), and realized the time has finally come to just stick to using plastic or acrylic from now on. I already have an acrylic glass that I really like, so that’s why I shopped for acrylic this time.  The quality is very good right out of the box. I use these every day, and though I have dropped them repeatedly, they have not so much as cracked. I haven’t yet put these in the dishwasher, because I know it will wear them faster (despite being dishwasher safe). It’s easy enough for me to just hand wash them. I’m so happy I purchased these!"
"So the story that prompted me to buy these is great, and I sincerely hope it's not inappropriate enough to get deleted. I have these Ikea shelving units with glass shelves. One is beside my bed and doubles as a night stand. A partner of mine was over one evening and I was showing off an item from my...erm..adult collection. It has a suction cup on the bottom. I thought it would be hilarious to demonstrate by sticking it to the bottom of one of the shelves. Of course, the glass shelves are not fixed to the shelving unit. I don't know what I was thinking. The shelf flew into the air and came crashing down on a drinking glass sitting on the shelf below. After recovering from embarrassment, I found myself assessing a diminishing drinking glass collection. I bought these to save myself from needing to constantly replace glasses. These look great for being acrylic, and solve one of the many issues my great clumsiness causes."
"I was l a little iffy when purchasing since some reviewers experienced cracks developing in their cups, but they seemed isolated and the cups looked like quality product, plus they're Made in USA, so I pulled the trigger.  I've had these for about three months so far and they're holding up great. We almost always wash them in the dishwasher, top rack. None of them have cracked and they haven't started developing swirls like cheap acrylic cups tend to. They're thick, crystal clear, and if you weren't holding them you'd swear they were glass. We tend to break class cups, so having ones that look the part that won't shatter is win/win. Would buy again!"
"Is there a place for 6 stars?? No? There should be! I bought the 24 oz. Glasses. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! I drink a lot of water during the day (and night), and was looking for a glass that is big enough to where I don't have fill up multiple times. This is that glass! A nice extra is, this thing doesn't sweat! I mean, there may be beads of water on the glass at the ice line. But that's it! I fully expected to have to put a paper towel on top of the coaster. Nope! I was amazed that my big glass of water stayed cool with no dripping water down the glass! I'm so in love with this glass. It's durable. It's attractive - really classy look! And it LOOKS like glass, until you pick it up, and are shocked that it's not! I highly recommend this glass. Couldn't be more pleased. Go for the 24 oz one too. You can fit a whole 16 oz beer in the glass with ease (as my buddy did this past weekend)!!!"
"These glasses are working great, but those of us who have used plastic ware know that longevity is a key concern. I will update this review in the future after they have been in use for awhile. A big plus for me was that they fit the cup holders in our TV/Movie chairs. Large capacity yet easy for the average person to hold. Good flat bottom to minimize tipping over if you are not using a cup holder. Great clarity after 7-8 trips through the dishwasher (top rack, of course). No scratches or cracking. My guests who like large glasses reach for these as their first choice. Big enough for a decent size smoothie."
"I bought these and had them engraved with everyone in my family’s individual names to cut down on disposable cup waste as well as to cut down on the number of cups we were washing.  My children would either go for a disposable cup or a new one from the cupboard every time they wanted a drink of anything. At the end of the each day we were damaging the environment and had stacks of glasses to wash as well.  I bought these in the hopes that we could eliminate both issues, and we did. We haven’t used a single disposable cup since I bought these, everyone loves to see their names on the cups, we’ve cut down on the washing of multiple cups, and since they’re made of acrylic and not glass, they’re far safer.  Excellent purchase."
"My wife and I make protein shakes every day and in order to do that as a ""one glass solution"" you need some big type glasses that are NOT tapered in the bottom so that the hand-held blender will go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  By the way... why is it so hard to find cylindrical shaped glassed - everything is shaped like a cone? Because cone-shaped glasses STACK BETTER. (Took me a while to figure that one out)  Anyway.... these glasses are GREAT and they are not easy to find. They're durable, seem to do well in the dishwasher and we are using the heck out of them for a variety of beverage needs. STRONGLY RECOMMEND."
"LOVE this set of glasses! We keep breaking our glasses at home, and we have a dog that is always licking the floor… (I know… weird right? ) I am always worried that he will get a sliver of glass that I missed! I took a chance and ordered these glasses and I could NOT be happier!! They look and feel just like real glass! The rim is not sharp plastic like I was afraid it would be! They feel durable and high quality. Can’t believe how nice they are! I’m pretty happy with this purchase!"
"I bought these because our teens were breaking too many glasses when they loaded the dishwasher, so I showed them: I bought these amazing plastic numbers and voilà- no more broken glass. Though puzzled by my lack of concern when observed throwing these ""glasses"" across the kitchen, no one was on to my subterfuge until  one of the tumblers rode the lower rack of the dishwasher and subsequently melted. It took a few melted tumblers, but eventually everyone understood that the new ""glasses"" needed to ride on the top rack. As for hard water deposits, a little  vinegar added to the rinse cycle keeps all the dishes clear and sparkling. Highly recommended."
"I was looking for a replacement set of plastic glasses for mixed drinks to use instead of glass. These are awesome! You can't even tell they aren't glass. The clarity is amazing. All at a decent price. I'm able to mix a moscow mule using an entire can of goslings, vodka, lime and ice with still a little room to spare to avoid spillage. Plus, albeit only after one use and it's not summer, my drink didn't sweat like it would in a real glass, glass, (even in winter). I'm very happy."
"I wanted to replace a set of old plastic glasses, and this product is just right. A set of eight; four tall and four short; and the best part (aside of the excellent price) is that they were made in the USA! While the first shipment was damaged (two glasses were cracked), that was not the fault of the manufacturer; it was the fault of the shipping company (the box was badly crushed on one corner, so the damage was not surprising). Amazon handled everything beautifully, and I am most pleased with this purchase. I took one star off for Durability, because obviously, these glasses can crack or break. Treated kindly, they will last, I am sure."
"I love the glasses, they are perfect for drinking ice water which I do daily. The only issue is if you accidently wash them wrong they are done! They will ""fog"" up, making them look dirty all the time, also looking like they have permanent lip marks on the rims. I just can't stand that and ordered more and gotten rid of the ones I had. I had also bought some from Amazon Warehouse that came like that, I should have sent them back but figured it out too late."
"I love these! I don’t like having to use actual glass cups for everyday use, so having these has really helped with keeping the risk of shattering glass on the tile floor low. The only thing, which isn’t a fault to the maker, is that you’ve got to be careful when washing it. Always use the soft or yellow part of the sponge to clean it. The green scrub on the back will scratch it all to heck and it won’t look good after a while. Just a tip to extend the appearance of the glasses.  Also, big plus that they’re made in the USA!"
"THEY ARE PLASTIC!!! How could I.... ME.... like plastic drinking glasses? And yet, when I go for water or a soft drink and there are lots of choices in my cabinet of wonderful, beautiful glass and crystal options--I now ALWAYS get one of these. They are light and hold enough water that I don't have to continue to go back for water refills. And may I add... water is good for you. And if you need something to gage how much water you are drinking? This is a great product. Will probably purchase more for family gatherings."
"Our house has an old cast iron, porcelain covered farm style sink. The house was built in 1896, I'm pretty sure it's original. We also don't have a dishwasher. We can not have glass..... Anything. I'm a bartender and when we moved into this house, May 2017, we had an impressive collection of miscellaneous pint glasses. We also have children. The glassesare pretty much all gone 2 and a half years later. We purchased these I love the plastic is clear and doesn't look cheap. Great size for kids to hold. We have 11/7/ and 18 months. The baby can hold with two hands. We don't break glass every day in the kitchen anymore."
"I love these tumblers. It is hard not to call them glasses because the plastic is so clear. I was worried the taller glasses would be too narrow as I am one who still washes my dishes by hand but.. they are great and i can reach to the bottom inside to clean. Another thing I like that maybe most wouldnt really notice or care, but the bottom is flat. So handy for hand washing and drying not to pick them up upside down and have a pool of water everywhere.. Also helps them dry nice and clear even with my questionable well water."
I had these in my cart for awhile before actually purchasing. So glad I finally did! I know it sounds strange-but I am not a fan of glass drink ware. So I began looking for some that were plastic type but had the nice appearance of glass. These were perfect! I have used them for different dinner events at my home and received compliments each time. They are comfortable to hold and easy to clean. Would definitely recommend!
"I was looking for plastic water glasses after my last set became cloudy and cracked after 5 years of dishwasher use. I took considerable time reading reviews, and found these glasses had overall positive reviews, but with some reports of cracking easily and arriving broken. I am happy to report my tumblers arrived well-packaged, are crystal clear and look like traditional glass tumblers. After 6 weeks of use, they are holding up well! I DO wash them in the dishwasher and I am aware with time the detergent will make small scratches that will cloud the plastic, but if I get 2-3 years of good use out of them, I am happy!  Of note, when stacked the tumblers only overlap by about 2 inches, so I can only stack them 2-high in my cabinet. Not a problem for me, but I wanted to give heads-up to shoppers that are looking to save lots of shelf space."
"These are the most beautiful non-glass glasses I've ever seen! With stone kitchen floors and thirsty friends and family frequently visiting, all (ALL) of my glass glasses are history. I prefer drink ware that's generously-sized, and prior to finding these, the choices have been disappointingly limited. Just got 'em, so I can't comment on how they stand up to routine use and care. I'm hoping they won't scratch easily or lose their clarity, but right now I'm a happy Amazonian. These glasses are not only the only kind I can use, but their design is classy and I'd be proud to offer a beverage to even the most discriminating of guests in one of them! Planning on buying at least one more 6-pack! Thank you!"
"Nobody likes to break a glass but you don't want to serve your beverages in unattractive plastic cups either. Problem solved with these 16 oz Quality Acrylic (plastic) tumblers. They are as clear as glass, dishwasher safe , and generic in their style to fit right in with any style table setting. These are an outstanding value and more than worth the price."
"Great, cheap set of cups made in the USA. Perfect for parents of young kids. We replaced our nice glass cups with these. Its not a fine crystal set but they are nice enough to use every day and with company... unless crystal glassware is important to you. For me, I just wanted a nice set of American made plastic BPA free cups to use daily and not worry about the kids breaking glass everywhere. These are clear and look like glass until you pick an empty cup up and notice how light it is compared to glass. I would buy again."
"I haven't had these a long time but so far I've been very happy with mine. I hand wash my dishes and since we have hard water I make sure to hand dry these so they don't get spots. My hands are pretty small and these are a perfect size for my hands to hold, very comfortable ! Great for ice water, ice tea and great for taking outside !"
"I was visiting a modern hotel in Salt Lake city and they had these glasses. I used them alot!! When I left, I couldn't stop thinking about them! I was so happy to find them on Amazon. They are made in the USA and PBA free! Nice fit while holding them in your hand, wash well in dishwasher on top shelf and the perfect size. I bought the 16oz set of 6, they were packaged well, arrived quick and I've been using them for about a month now. Great plastic glasses. So happy with my purchase."
"We purchased the glasses in May, 2021. A few weeks ago, two of the glasses cracked after I placed ice in them. I looked through my previous purchases to see if the product had a warranty. I called the manufacturer, they’re sending a new set to me. Great customer service! You will not be disappointed if you purchase this product. We love the size, and they match any color of plates you may own."
"We like to sit outside in the evenings in the summer. We have big floofy dogs with impressive out of control tails. I like plastic glasses. I have used these for 6 months, inside and outside. They look and feel good. I thought by now they would be scratched and cloudy. They look new. I can't tell which one I use daily. We rarely use the dish washer. But, they've been through on the top rack a few times with no issues."
"These are a great size and the glasses look really nice. They seem durable and easy to take care of. I ran them through the dishwasher when I first got them and they came out fine. I was looking for thin acrylic glasses that looked like glass and weren't too clunky. I personally like glass cups better but I don't like it when they break! So I decided to look for plastic/acrylic glasses and for the price and size, these were a good buy"
"I love the look of these cups, they're crystal clear and classic. They are also bigger than typical cups, but not bulky. They can fit easily into the cupboard and dishwasher, but I don't have eto continually refill them either. I love that they're the same circumference(or close to it) from top to bottom, they don't go wider or skinnier at different places, which I prefer astheitcally and for use of space. They were a tiny bit pricier than plastic glasses at other retailers, but I was happy to spend a bit more for the size I wanted and the crisp look. Im also happy that they offered prime shipping as I left my old cups behind while moving and needed some for our new house quickly. I am completely satisfied with this purchase."
"My daughter recently expanded her family to include three school aged children, her glassware was living hard and biting the dust almost daily. These glasses look exactly like they are made of glass and not plastic. They've only been used a few days, so not sure how long they'll remain this clear. Overall, sturdy, nice looking. Will pick up a few hobnail type drinkware for the kids to have a better grip when they are taking a drink away from the table. Very pleased with the initial look."
"I'm surprised by the some of the more helpful reviews: I've had zero issues with them breaking, with sharp edges, or with them getting stuck together when stacked.  I bought them about a year ago and used them in a reasonably rowdy college apartment, and despite whatever manner of mishandling (probably, at worst, dropping from 4 or so feet off the ground) we've never had any break or even develop a crack. We also have always stacked them in the cabinet; they don't fit super well into each other (only go down about a half an inch), so we could only stack up two at a time at most, but we certainly nevery had any issues separating them afterward.  My only potential complaint would be that, as a person with an incredible youthful thirst, even the bigger size cups seem a little small, but this I knew when I bought them."
"Love these tumblers! They look exactly like clear, beautiful glass. Have to pick them up and feel the lighter weight to realize that they are not glass. Recently got granite counter tops & have broken 3 of our good everyday glasses since. This will take care of that. With just my husband and me, we don’t use the dishwasher that much except when we have company. I have elected not to put these in dishwasher. Some of the detergents etch clear glass & plastic. These are so beautiful I don’t want to take a chance but that is just my personal choice. I imagine they would be fine in a good dishwasher & good detergent."
Great cups that look like glass but aren’t! These cups look like glass so they have a “grown up” look to them but are plastic so you don’t have to worry about them breaking. I put them in the dishwasher and they’re holding up great. No complaints! UPDATE: I’ve had these now for 1.5 years and some have a few cracks. Not enough for me to change my rating as they’ve lasted a long time through many dishwasher sessions. I would rebuy
I ordered like 12 of the smaller ones for my grandkids. They were so nice I ordered this size. I’m gonna get another order of these they are really nice and classy. Until you touch it it’s hard to tell it’s not glass. They’re safe for outside as well. Just one of the many items I’ve purchased from Amazon that I’m more than pleased with. These are as advertised. Will recommend
"I like how they look just like glass, but are much lighter and safer than glass. These glasses do not break so easily! These are perfect for children, and elderly, who tend to drop things regularly. A little wet mess is far easier to deal with than a broken glass danger zone."
"I gifted these to my daughter for her birthday. She has 4 kids and likes to entertain. These are a sturdy, durable plastic and a safer way to go . They aren’t as slippery as glass, easier to grip, are dishwasher safe on the upper shelf and look like glassware. Great quality at a low price!"
"Purchased these classics due to always breaking glasses whether washing them or putting them away,etc...they break. Dropped one of the cups and smiled, it didn't break. Now I use the small ones for my fur baby who refuses to use her glass water bowl! They were feasible & worth the price!"
"So bought them because we had a new hot tub and I wanted nonbreakable glasses.  After they arrived I washed them and set them out on the counter. A few days later my husband picked one up and said ""I thought these were glass! They look so nice."" They do look and feel great."
"I purchased the larger capacity glass (22oz) from this manufactor a couple of years ago. Top shelf dishwasher safe. They are just as nice now as they were new. The 16 oz ones are a smaller version and should be great. They have a realatively thin lip, fit the hand well, are properly proportioned. Cold milk sips nicely from them. Would recommend."
"One could be confused by seeing an overall 5 star rating when few of the product features received that kind of rating. Let me explain! Products can fail, issues can arise, but the way a manufacturer stands behind their product is everything to me. We had an issue, some cracking appeared in the base of some of the glasses. When I contacted US Acrylic regarding the issue, their very first response was to offer a replacement set. No questions, just the exact response you would hope to see. Despite the issue and because of their response, I will highly recommend the company's products. Should I find myself in need of further acrylic products (likely as I live on a boat), I will go to them first!"
"These are great so far! We've had them about a month. So far, they have no wierd plastic smell, they're great in the dishwasher and don't collect water on the bottom after washing. I feel so much better with these than I did when I had glasses...i am pretty clumsy and tend to drop things. I haven't dropped them yet but they do seem pretty strong! They're also very clear which is nice. They look very tidy and I like that."
"We've been using these for a few weeks now. My partner, who is something of a klutz, had a history of dropping things. Onto a concrete floor. Granted, they're still clumsy, but at least now the glasses don't break.  Side note - between the two of us, we've dropped these things a few times. Some of those drips were tests of the durability. Anyway, we have pretty good eyes, and we don't see any scratches. Pretty well made I'm happy to say."
"LOVE these cups. They are nice in appearance and have held up really well! I even put them in the dishwasher and they come out great. I do get some spots, because since they're plastic and not glass, they don't heat up enough in the dry cycle to evaporate all the water. But I'm ok with that. I'm from the South so I'm a huge tea drinker, and they do stain a bit. But ever since a flu bug hit my household this winter, I've gotten in the habit of putting some bleach crystals in the dishwasher along with my detergent and that takes the stains right off!! So even with bleach and the dishwasher, I've not had any cracking or anything! Very happy."
Grant it I just got the glasses a few days ago but we love them! NO sharp edges and beautiful glass look acrylic glasses. I dont recommend that you stack them because they won't nest inside each other. I've washed them in the dishwasher and hand washing and each time they come out nicely. I'm so glad I bought these!
"I like these for my husband. His hand shake so bad he ends up breaking them when putting them in the sink or washing them, not to mention dropping. I do prefer to serve my guest glass wear. These are also great for the elderly who would benefit from using them."
"These really look like glass. I keep being worried they're about to break when I see them in the sink. I bought plastic ones because too many glass ones got broken between my husband and my teenager and I was worried someone was going to get cut on glass. Lightweight but they feel reasonably sturdy, I don't notice any rough edges around the top."
"I ordered these without noticing they were plastic. I thought they were glass initially, however they are very durable and we've used them a lot. I think if they had been glass, we would have broken them a while ago. Good size and good quality."
"I paid a great price for this set of 8! I use fine china and glass drinkware at home but, I needed something that would not break as traveling down the road in the RV. So far so good! The whole family likes theses tumblers! They thought it was real glass at first when I served them ice tea...hehehe! I paid more for a set of 4 juice acrylic drinkware pieces! I do hand wash in warm soapy water with a soft sponge and rinse with hot water. Then after all is washed, I dry them with a soft micro fiber rag. No problems on scratching and no white glaze! Even if these tumblers did get some minor scratches and a little white glaze, I would not complain at all for, the price is amazing and it does serve its purpose of being unbreakable as traveling in a vibrating and swaying environment. To top it off.... these tumblers will hold its liquid for many decades to come! I love them!"
These glasses are definitely worth the purchase. I got rid of my cheap mismatched plastic cup collection and these glasses are definitely an upgrade. They look so elegant and are definitely sturdy. Other reviewers mention that they become cloudy if you put them in the dishwasher....um when you put plastic in a dishwasher....that's what happens??? I have no problem hand washing these beautiful cups and it's perfect for company.
"These are high quality, durable and easy to clean plastic glasses. -I have washed them in the dishwasher many times now (top shelf) and they come out great -They are 24oz, which holds quite a bit. In the picture I put it next to a standard 16oz drinking glass -The rim of the glass isn't completely smooth, which some may find annoying. I have only noticed it once, otherwise it never bothers me."
"First, the customer support for US Acrylic is excellent, and if I was rating the company rather than the product, I would give them a full 5 Stars. I received the glasses, used the large 18 oz glasses for water only, hand washed, no hot or cold temperatures, and within two weeks, two of the glasses had cracks in the bottom bases of the glasses. The 14 oz tumblers seemed in good condition, and the cracks did not go all the way through the bases, but my wife and I were afraid to use the glasses in case the cracks worsened. I contacted US Acrylic, and they very readily offered to replace the whole order. While we were waiting for the replacements to arrive, we discovered that one of the two remaining 18 oz glasses also developed a long narrow crack in the base. Considering we don't dishwash or even remotely roughly handle the break resistant glasses, 3 out of 4 cracking is unacceptable quality."
"I have been using these cups for a couple of weeks now and I have to say they are great. They stand up to the heat of my dishwasher amazingly. They are extremely durable. I have 3 kids, two of which are toddlers. I have finally found a cup set that can stand up to them."
"Finally! Nice looking glasses I can enjoy using without having to sweep up glass every single day because I have a weak right hand and a very small kitchen! I like glass glasses, but was having to resort to others which I hated. These glasses are good-looking and store easily as the tall glasses fit into the small ones. Nobody would know the difference except that they're lighter...I have seen them bounce into other rooms with not a mar on them! Thank you for these wonderful glasses for people like me!!!"
"I cant say enough about these glasses and I even bought them used. I still cant believe they are plastic, they look breakable. I get compliments on them all the time and I never again have to worry about the set of 6 glasses becoming a set of 5 or less. Thank you Amazon!"
After using glass drinking glasses and accidentally dropping and breaking them on tile floors we started looking for a replacement that wouldn't shatter when dropped. No fun in cleaning up shattered glass. When we saw these acrylic glasses we decided to try them. They are clear and have a weight to them and you'd think they were glass. We bought the 16 oz. for drinking for meals and the 7 oz. for juice. So happy with them.
I have had these glasses for several months and have absolutely no complaints about them. They go in the top rack of the dishwasher and come out without spots or problems every time. My husband and I are getting older (who isn't?) and find that we are dropping things more often than we used to. These plastic glasses look good and don't break.
"I really like the shape, weight and lip of this cup. It’s plastic though so will fog up if washed with a coarse sponge. It’s got a pretty thin lip which I like and hold a good amount a liquid which is what I wanted. Very happy with purchase"
"I was skeptical because of the reviews, but OMG. These cups are amazing! We have received so many compliments and I’ve already had guests ask for the link. They couldn’t believe the price or that they were from amazon. They have already gone through the dish washer twice and they are still crystal clear!"
"These look like glass but without the condensation.  Light but sturdy.  Dishwasher safe.  Pleasant to drink from.  My two biggest concerns when ordering these were: 1) they would scratch easily and the ""glass"" look would quickly change to a scuffed plastic. No problem there. I've been using them daily for over a month, and no scratches. 2) They would get brittle from the top rack of the dishwasher. Again, doesn't appear to be an issue with these."
"The cups are a perfect size for small hands, kids and when you only want to drink a small amount."
"the best cups, beautiful colors."
Good deal
Using for transplanting small seedlings. They save on room compared to large cups.
They did the job. Would buy again.
"Liked the size, enough to drink and easily held by children. Like the bright colors as well!"
They are cute and convenient
Muy pequeño
""
I used the cups for a party. There were enough to go around. Delivered quick.
I used them to start pepper plants indoors. Worked great until it was time to transfer the plants to a larger container.
Unlike the stability of the cups and the color
"The money was definitely worth it, they are great cups"
"Feel more like one time use cups from Brazil or Europe. If you have never travelled abroad, and want to experience the difference between American made and what is considered acceptable in every other market on earth, you can experience the ultimate in cheap manufacturing. I used them to mix epoxy, which worked out great."
"Recently had to purchase red cups for my birthday party. This order came in the nick of time. Sturdy and easy to hold. Whether 16oz or a shot size, these cups are awesome. Your bartender will thank you. Enjoy"
"I assumed red party cups were all the same size so when I got this I was a little disappointed that they are small. Nothing wrong with them, I’m still going to use it. Just know they are the smaller size."
Nice small cup. I use them for my grandkids.
I did not like these cups to small to hold and no stiffness a waste of money
Too small. I ordered the wrong size. I love the colors!
These are small. Perfect size for toddlers just Way overpriced!
""
These cups are far far smaller than you would expect. The plastic is also really inconsistent. Some are flimsy and brittle while others are thick and hold their shape really well. Even if you could get past the size the quality is completely missing. I am using them for cheap temporary plant pots so it doesnt matter too much if they fall apart. But they will definitely fall apart on you.
I like these. I like the bright colors but I need a larger size. But they will work.
Smaller than what I was expecting. Nice colors but not for the price....
To small..
"This is very thin, the cup I buy at the grocery store is much thicker and costs less."
definitely not 50 cups and they are cheap
Overpriced
These are absolutely not 9 oz!!! And for 7.99?!? I was expecting wayyyyy bigger and better! I bought these so I didn’t have to go out in the storm. I should have known better. And I can’t return them? Thanks Amazon! Lesson learned.
Small size . Very thin material
Misleading advertising will never never buy from that seller .
Not what I want it I want it the larger cups
$8.99 ÷ 50 cups is $0.179 per cup not .04
I’m disappointed. I thought I was purchasing more than 50 cups. I would’ve never bought 50 cups for $8.99 I gave it 5 star bc I did receive all colors. The disappointment was the picture shown looks like more than 50 cups
Fun cheap cups and cute colors!
Dislike
Sturdiness
Plastic is a little thin but worked great for my childs birthday party.
"Since the COVID Virus I had been having issues finding bathroom size cups which I use as a measurement for snacks, as well as its intended use in the bathroom. I love that the cups came in numerous sleeves so you only had open the number that you needed at one time instead of a huge boxful of open cups. Very convenient and since they are opaque you can see exactly how much liquid or snack is contains."
I use these for mixing epoxy and they are awesome. I love that they came packaged in a box and they are clear. It makes it so much easier to store them and see how well my epoxy is mixed.
"We use these plastic cups to drink cold water from our water cooler.  + These cups are perfect for drinking water. + The size is prefect for our use: 9 oz + Great price point. $17.99 / 500 = 3.5 cents per cup. + They are also recyclable. So no need to toss them in the landfill.  No negatives that i see. I wish they were biodegradable, but they are recyclable. So that works for me."
I have been looking for this size disposable cups for my bathroom. Stores that used to have them don't anymore. They are perfect and fit my cup holder perfectly. They could be washed and reused if you wanted because they are very sturdy.
"What a treat to have a small cup for drinking (I haven't tried anything hot like the listed espresso), smashing up ice cream to use as a medicine carrier, mixing craft paint, short term storage or carrier for lotions and creams, and many other uses to come-- and the cup doesn't get soggy like paper cups. We're no longer using the little medicine cup that comes on top of the liquid bottles-- much more hygienic and safe to pour the medicine into these cups after measuring only with the manufacturer cup. Very pleased with purchase."
"I am pleased with these. I teach preschool. We use them for snack drinks. They have been great so far, in the 1st week using them. No leaking ones yet!! Other cups we have ordered had a lot leaky ones. Not these!"
I have purchased cups from Amazon before that were so thin just picking them up squeezed the contents over the top. These cups are much sturdier and simply put - do the job.
"These little plastic cups are very useful - in the car, at home, -everywhere. Great for snacks while driving and taking medicine etc. etc. Thank You!!!"
This product provides great lighting and the charge lasts a long time. I like the feature that allows it to power down when there isn't movement.
"This is an ordinary item, very good quality. One more thing I don't have to go shopping to get. I love Amazon."
Excellent cups. Item as described . Packed with care. Highly recommend these and I would order again.
My wife want this size cup. Have tried paper cups this size and they are pretty worthless. These are flexible and durable.
Beter than paper cups. Good for holding liquid over night or for an extended period of time.
The price is relatively low for a quality product. Works well for mixing crushed medications.
Use this product to put a plant in for students. The students used a variety of sharpie markers and colored one cup. When they get the plants that were planted in a cup they will put their colored cup over it for the holidays and give it away as a present pre use this product to put a plant in for students.

This is my second cup purchase for my son’s school. The first batch of cups was in one big bag and this time they are in a box packaged like crackers. I like the new packaging because now the cups can be divided up amongst the teachers!
Ordered many times great product
"This is my 2nd time buying this product. 1st time was in March. I have a family of 6, had 2 family bbq’s with about 15 people who attended, overnight guest, and just bought my 2nd pack after 3 months. The cups are sturdy and a good price. Had no problem with leakage. Good to plant seeds for my garden😉👍🏽"
"These sturdy leakproof glasses are so much better for camper kids than using my dishes. After using them, they can toss. No more dishes lying around the ranch."
"Love these sheer, sturdy cups and use them for many purposes, but mostly in the bathroom! Paper cups are not very sturdy and can only use them once; however you can reuse these after rinsing. I use these for measuring when cooking as well! Such a value verses purchasing these at the grocery store!"
Just what I needed as none are available in the stores.
"They hold up well. We use them inside the bathroom for when you brush your teeth. And, work great for that purpose. Will continue to buy these from now on."
These cups were exactly as I expected. They came packaged very efficiently. I am totally pleased with my purchase.
"I'm a teacher and COVID caused our school to shut down water fountains. We instead used the fountains that filled bottles. Some students would forget to bring water bottles, so I provided them with cups. I didn't need them to be super sturdy because they weren't meant to be reused. No better deal for the price."
Works just like it it should.
Pleased with product and service.
These have been hard to find from our regular vendors. I'm glad we found these.
The clear plastic cups are sturdy and a great value.
"I was quite impressed with the sturdiness of these cups, they are perfect for bathroom use and for taking medicine...perfect amount of water to take meds."
I do alcohol demos and use these to hand out samples. They are perfect size.
This is my first time bying this product. I really like that the cups are packaged in stakcs of separte sleeves. Thanks.
Used in pourpainting for mixing small amounts of paint.
So happy to see 9oz cups. These are great cups and to be able to get a case is the best. Delivery was fast and price was great
Works as advertised
The small head is very nice and doesn't split the woood on small projects.
Use at the office water cooler. Works perfect for its intended purpose. Great value!
Good product. Quantity in box is great.
Reasonable as cheap cups go. Not super strong but not super weak.
These things lasted me forever! So worth it
I need them for work so Works just fine
he uses them to test chemical composition of his fish tanks
Great small cup for the bathroom or any other use around the house. Excellent quality. Very sturdy and a great value for the price.
They hold exactly A cup of liquid and they are good value
They were used to give the children enough juice to drink. We will use the rest of the in different Project in the coming days.
Really like these plastic mini cups as opposed to paper cups. They are well-made and sturdy.
Great value!
To thin
"Excellent product,price,service and shipping!"
Great quality!
These cups are perfect for the morning and evening pills that I take daily. So much better than paper!
I love these cups for the bathroom. Excellent quality.
Love these great size keep on my kitchen counter and use for a quick drink- saves me a lot of washing!
Perfect for measuring car wash soap. Sturdy enough for the industry. Good quantity for the money.
These Cups worked great for what we needed them for. I will be buying more soon.
Great size. Good quality
Like. Perfect for our needs. Paper cups do not support everything and these cups work well. Thanks
good for morning juice
Great bathroom cups. Better quality compared to the paper waxed cups used in bathrooms.
Exactly as advertised. Good price for the amount of cups you get.
"What can I say? They are plastic cups, they work!"
Love these cups good quality
Good
Could not be more pleased
good quality cups and good value
Just what I was looking for.
Very happy with the prompt delivery.
Good value.
I used these cups for paint and to melt crayons. They work great for crafts!
They are perfect for my dixie cup bathroom holder
Perfect product
"These cups are great for drinking out of, but let me tell you they’re not suited to (even temporary) storage of kerosene - which, I have learned, looks a lot like good whiskey, but only tastes like cheap bourbon. I give them five stars because they are excellent for putting over things you don’t want to clean up yet (like small dog turds on hardwood) so you don’t step on them but can still see what’s in there, so you remember eventually to deal with it before your in-laws come over."
"We use these clear plastic cups for drinking our fruit juices. These cups always arrive clean wrapped in sealed plastic. That is also what I like about these cups, because they do not arrive all dusty and that they have no holes punched into the plastic for the dust and dirt to get through. We like the 12 OZ size of these cups. They are sturdy and nice to use. We have ordered them many times from the same seller. The cups are disposable, but you can also wash them if you'd like and re-use them. I hope this review helps. Sabiene :) see"
"When you are having a wedding and serving people beer from a keg, I am not sure how classy that is suppose to be...however, having guests get their drink in a clear plastic cup and giving it a nice identification label makes a big difference in the overall appearance. There was no color to detract from the brides vision of colors and no glaring red or blue cups. It looked really nice and people made comments on how nice everything looked. Did it help the beer taste better? Probably not, but it didn't have to look like a frat party."
"Sometimes cups are used for more than just drinking out of. I use clear cups for an experiment that I do with my classes. The students need to be able to see the liquids in the cups, all of the liquids need to be at the same level, and the cups need to be clearly labeled. These cups are perfect for all of those purposes. The notch about 1/4 of the way up the cup makes it easy to have roughly equal amounts of liquids, the cups are absolutely clear, and they easily maintain Sharpie labeling. I bet they'd be great to drink from, too. :-) They arrived very quickly and in great condition. I'll be purchasing these again for science and leisure purposes."
"I read several reviews about the cups not be sturdy and was somewhat apprehensive about ordering. However, they were not flimsy at all. They were good quality, packaged in individual stacks so the entire quantity wasn't open and being scattered and could be opened as needed. I would definitely buy them again and highly recommend them. You won't be sorry you bought them."
"When I buy something over the internet, I'm always concerned with what I might be getting. I am very pleased with these cups. They are the right thickness so they will not spill over easily or collapse. I can use more than once. Once I run out, I will purchase again."
"Bought these for a family reunion. They are really durable. Had a few left over and have ran them through the dishwasher *top rack several times, and they are still good! The rim is enforced very well. (Have you lifted a drink by the rim and had the cup crack? These will not, even filled with ice and liquid.)"
I use these for casting pen blanks in Alumilite polyurethane or Liquid Diamonds epoxy. They are for mixing the casting material before putting into molds. Work perfectly for this purpose. These are PET plastic which is proper for these casting compounds.
We used these lovely cups for a family party as there were over forty of us. They looked fine next to all my formal china settings. I just didn't have forty matching glasses! I started using them next to my water cooler as well because no one drinks enough water and more importantly the cups look like crystal! I've already ordered another pack. Great product.
They were functional as advertised... They are cups. They held our liquids and sometimes even snacks for the car. Cups are good. We like cups.
"Larger and sturdier than expected. The plastic is thick enough, my kids had no issue gripping it."
These are hefty cups. They don't break when squeezed. Nice cup. I will repurchase them because I like them better than the big red cup.
"Great product, fair price, and superfast shipping - what could possibly be better?!?!?"
Very sturdy cup - never felt like it was going to crush in my hand. These are so durable that you could wash and reuse if you wanted - but we buy disposable because we don't want to. lol Fast delivery from supplier.
The plastic glasses are very sturdy and useful for family gatherings.
Great Product. Great buy. Beautiful clear cups. Thanks for sending so quickly. Will purchase again.
"I ordered this product as I had two parties back to back and clear could fit with any theme. I liked that they came packaged 50 per sleeve, with both sleeves again packaged for protection. The cups are clear and hold liquid as you would hope a cup would. Very happy with my purchase."
"These are solid, elegant cups that don't feel cheap. The plastic is not the type that will easily crack or get crushed which I like."
for the buck a great value. We like the clear ones so the bartenders can see how much is in the cup. Cant do that with a red solo.
Bought the 16 oz. cups because we hosted Thanksgiving dinner this year for the whole family. They are sturdy - none of them were cracked or warped. We only went through one sleeve of them for dinner so it’s great having extras on hand for when we need them.
Great product! Will repurchase them!
Fantastic cups for work. Better than your typical flimsy bar cup. Customers love these. Will continue to order
SO MUCH better than solo cups from walmart. I like the crystal transparency of the cups. Thank you for a wonderful product. Will buy many times again.
Used as cup holders for my first graders by hole punching and putting a super strong zip tie! Its awesome!!!
Great product..definitely meets our needs. 👍🏼
Great looking and makes an icy drink SO much more appealing than a colored or opaque cup; I will buy again and keep these in stock. They don't hold up in the dishwasher but can be hand washed and used again.
"Perfect for mimosas , tequila & squirt, tequila sunrise. They are sturdy. Don't rip and aren't flimsy and some plastic cheap cups"
Use daily for Tea Samples. Have had Great reviews on the cups. Will use this company again. Great product.
Love the size
GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!
"These cups have become a staple in my home, got to have them for when my grandson comes up for Kool-aid. I also use them for smoothies."
"I used these for acrylic paint pouring and there’s nothing not to like about them lol. One thing I did discover was that the small plastic cups with lids, the lids fit on these taller cups if you applied them carefully lol. (Flimsy rims)"
Great size. Very sturdy!
"i like that they are not the super huge plastic cups in the store so grandkids don't have to fill with too much sugar drinks and adults waste less by starting with less! and with 39 folks coming for thanksgiving, i don't have enough cups myself anyhow!"
Good
"Are use these for both of my water machines at home. I keep them next to a pack of markers so everyone can write their name on them and nobody wastes plastic. Plus, I don’t have to do dishes! It’s a win-win"
"Great quality and price- wish they weren’t out of stock, because I wanted to reorder."
Not much to say; they're cold drink cups.
I bought the galsses for root starting primarily. They are also good for summer drinks. They dont sweat much on your tables. Wonder what else they are good for.
They are very well made
I buy a sick of these every few months. They’re great!
I use these for smoothies. Works great
Great size
Great buy. Product came on time and was just as described. The cups worked great for my party. I would definitely buy again.
"Sturdy, matched the description. I like that they’re BPA free!"
Great cups for pouring beer into.
"Excellent large size, very durable and the quantity for the price couldn’t be beat at my local stores."
"Shipped quickly, well packaged and as described! Very happy!"
"Have received these cups quickly. They look good, but I won't be using them until mid September. I can better review these after having used them."
"I've been buying these for a couple of years now and they're excellent quality and value. I have a bunch of nice glasses in my home but I prefer these and I'm not always filling up the upper rack of my dishwasher.as we seem to use a lot of glasses. Out into the recycle bin they go! We also use them around our pool even though we have those big fat insulated plastic tumblers which I find cumbersome. This is a nice feeling cup and amazingly enough, they don't seem to sweat a lot.  I like the large size and I find them so much better than colored Solo cups who's sides are sometimes unstable when you pick up your drink. They're durable and don't stick together even though they're packed in large quantities. And being crystal clear, they make our drinks look refreshing and inviting. I really enjoy these."
These are the best disposable cups I’ve ever purchased. Very sturdy!
This product is wonderful. I will order more to keep a supply in my pantry.
"Nice and sturdy, good for beer"
Solid cups! Best deal !!
"The cups are sturdy, not flimsy. We use for smoothies."
"Good sturdy cups, ordered many times."
"Good product! Used these when we had friends over, felt less childish than like college red cups (at least that's what I'm telling myself because I refuse to do that many dishes haha)"
Will order again.
Work fine for my orange tree cuttings
"We purchase these for different occasions for our restaurant, this is the second time we have bought these, great valu very good product."
"First of all, the colors are all washed out, not vibrant as in the photo on the Amazon site. Secondly, the pebble style is on the INSIDE of the glasses, making them harder to wash, instead of on the outside, which would have made the glasses easier to hold!"
"The glasses are nice, and I kept them although they looked very delicate. After a few months of using them, I had to revise my rating up- they've been dropped on the ceramic tile floor several times without a chip of a crack resulting. The texture is on the inside of the glass, and they are smooth on the outside. It seems like it would have been better to have the bumps on the outside, where they could help to hold the glass."
"These are nice big cups but not so big you can’t hold them. The colors are very nice! The yellow and green look very similar but the colors are great so that doesn’t bother me. So far, no scratches or cracks. Most importantly, the edges are smooth unlike other product reviews I read while trying to find these. Easy to hold and great cups for the price!"
"These cups are awesome! My daughter has dripped them several times on my concrete patio and tile floor, and not even a crack or chip. I forsee having these cups for a very long time. They look like glass and are very stylish! Highly recommend"
"I have put these in the top of my dishwasher and they come out great. I DO have to polish them sometimes, but that is not because of the glass. It is durable, a great size, and looks like glass. Very happy"
"They're the ideal summery ice-tea-pink-lemonade glasses. We practically swill ice tea in the summer and these glasses hold just the right generous amount. Everything you put in them appealing through the icy ""glass."""
"Love these!!! These cups are aesthetically pleasing and well made. Really happy they came intact. There were no damages, no blemishes, no defects. Great starter cups for first time home/apartment owners. So happy with them! Affordable and beautiful!"
"I needed new glasses, but did not actually want glass. I also wanted something that I could put in the dishwasher and still look pretty. It washes great in the dishwasher and really are pretty."
Absolutely love these “glasses”!! Not only did they come in gorgeous colors but they won’t break when my kids drop them!! They’re also huge. Exactly what I was looking for!! Thank you!!
We really like the weight and the look of this plastic wear. We entertain often and these are perfect on our dining table and outside as well. The size is perfect for iced tea!
"Great feel and look. First batch was a test before we dumped our old favorites. Once we stopped using the old ones and were already searching for the new ones in the cabinet, we knew it was time for more. Our favorite tumblers and a great price. Highly recommended."
"Exactly what I was looking for. A nice large cup for beverages that I don’t have to worry about breaking. Plus dishwasher safe. The colors are nice, pretty texture make it a fun tumbler cup. I use these for ice coffees and cocktails!"
I bought these to replace some cheap ones I had from a discount store. They are great and hold up through the dishwasher nicely. Vibrant colors and they match my dish set perfectly. Already purchased another set!
"Sturdy , color is still nice and bright I’ve had them for a year does well in dishwasher."
"So far, so good. These are relatively thick and sturdy. Love the capacity as well. I struggled to find double-walled tumblers, so this appeared to be the next best thing. They are also pretty."
I prefer larger plastic cups to glass and these are exactly what I was looking for. They're sturdy and look nice.
The cups are a nice set that feel quality and hold up well. Other than maybe crushing them I feel they won't break anytime soon. My children have drop them and knocked them off of things with no damage as off yet. Overall pleased
These cups are a perfect size for an adult to hold in 1 hand and hold a good amount of liquid. They have held up in the dishwasher very nicely. This was a great price for the set of 8 and they colors are nice.
The glasses have a vibrant color and are easy to clean. You are able to get a good grip on them and they are a generous size.
"DURABLE AND COLORFUL PLASTIC CUPS. GREAT FOR OUTDOORS, PICNICS AND POOL AREA. ECO-FRIENDLY."
"Great for summer time drinks to have outside, around the pool. No glass to worry about and holds a lot. Perfect size to hold lost of ice and beverages. I wash it on the top shelf of dishwasher rack and have had no problems"
"These are pretty colors and the texture makes them fun. They are sturdy plastic and the texture is on the inside, so it's smooth to hold. They have held up well on the top rack of the dishwasher. I use them every day."
"I was tired of scratchy looking glasses with calcium stains so I am hoping these will resist that. Also, these are more sturdy to have around my grandkids."
"The glasses are good looking, feel sturdy enough, and are dishwasher safe. My husband wishes they were larger, but that doesn't matter to me. I think they are fine the size they are."
I really like these as I can get my hand inside to dry them and they stack nicely making it easy to get more in the cupboard. A nice size for family meals.
"Looks like as pictured. Good deal and quality for price. Plastic and lightweight, but looks like glass. Good, sized tumbler cups."
We use these glasses in our backyard and porch after breaking glass ones. They are attractive and easy to hold. I thought they might have been larger but they work well for us. A good buy!
I am so happy with the vibrant colors of these plastic glasses. They wash nicely and are just the right size for a soft drink over ice.
"Trying to ween my elderly father off of ""old"" plastic barware/glasses--this did the trick. They look nice. They are sturdy. Quite pleased!"
I like these a lot. They look good and seem to be sturdy. I was also surprised how well they keep ice. I just wanted some cheap cups but I got more than I expected.
"The bumpy design on the inside of the tumbler, should be on the outside for better gripping."
"We use these everyday and put them in the dishwasher. So far, they still look great."
I like that they are nice and tall and they hold a lot of drink.But the only thing that I didn't like is the design is inside the cup but that's not a big deal and they definitely deserve a a5 star ⭐
"Sturdy, easy to hold, classy!"
I really like these glasses. You're very pretty and with their design they look very expensive. They are nice and big and cold and can .hold lots of cool drinks
These glasses arrived quickly. They were very safely packaged to prevent any breakage. They are good quality and look very nice.
We are using these daily at home! Great for a family with teenagers who tend to break glasses that are left in the sink. Nice size!
Nice glasses but hard to tell difference between green and yellow. It would be perfect if green were greener.
I used these as vases for centerpieces was making. My order for glass vases was cancelled. They turned out great and now I have a nice set of glasses!!
We love these. They are light and dishwasher safe. They keep their gloss. I will buy them again.
"I like these cups. They are sturdy, easy to clean, and easy to hold. Dropped them a a few times and they have not brake"
"I love these glasses!!! They are sturdy, and I LOVE the bright colors! All of mine are as bright as they show on Amazon!"
Love the colors so you don't mix up your glass with anothers.
"Good looking, dishwasher safe"
"They're colorful, sturdy and yet lightweight. They're plastic which is perfect for outside and my grandkids."
They are cute! My husband and I love using them! They are cute and are plastic! So even if you're clumpys like me you cant possibly break them!
Just wanted simple cups. Very durable and handy. A lot larger than expected
These cups look good but are plastic. They are everyday-cups at my house perfect size
These are a bit large for kid hands. LOVE the large cup. Sturdy. Not a thin plastic
These are nice looking plastic glasses. Would order again.
Just the right size
"Great glasses, wash well in dishwasher!"
Very nice for crowds. No breakage
Cups are just as described. Look like glass but they are plastic.
Great tumblers! Love these! Lightweight but sturdy.
These make me weirdly happy. They are really nice. Fun color. Great size. I may even order again.
Bigger than most glasses for getting adequate hydration. Light to hold. Unbreakable.
Very sturdy and cute glasses! I am so glad I bought them! Great bargain!
Purchased these for our camp and they are great!
Easy to hold. Design makes gripping easier. Holds a lot of fluid.
Muy lindos y grandes
"Very easy ti hold, dishwasher safe and useful for out door"
Perfect value and look amazing!
"My kids break all my glasses so I decided to give these a try. They hold a good amount of liquid and are durable, the colors add a fun flare to our kitchen ware."
Los vasos son tal y como se ven en la foto y son bastante robustos
"Terrific, classy and sophisticated look without worrying of breaking."
Looks nice and very durable
Lovely and vibrant colours
I just got my glasses in yesterday. I put them in the dishwasher and absolutely loved them! I ordered another set today.
Worth it. Very nice cups.
"The cups are awesome and the price was good for the quantity that I received. The only problem I have encountered is the cups stick together quite often, and you have to watch to make sure you only pick up one cup. Other than that, I recommend these for sure!!"
"When I bought these I thought these are the very cheap, thin plastic cups but actually these are very sturdy."
IT WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY!
Loved it!!! I bought it for my cousin and rolled a t-shirt inside! I perfect for lefty and righty !
The letters came off sparkling clean within one wash…. Almost like a new cup!!??
Just the best comment on how the little guys and gals feel about their humans. Too bad the commentary and art wore off right away!
Smaller than expected1 Otherwise great!
Loved it and so did the person I gifted it to!
Probably the funniest gift of the night. My 20 year old daughter opened and howled because she knew I didn't realize the cat is flipping you off. I didn't.... Quality is fine. My attention to detail is not. Lol.
I got as a gift for a coworker he loved it.
Love it
Love these glasses. I do wish the indentations were on the outside of the glass and not the inside. It would help with gripping the glass.
"Not too heavy. Appropriate for any company that may visit. I love the circular look, but it's easy to tell if the class is clean, especially coming out of the dishwasher. No buyers' remorse here."
"I was expecting them to be a bit bigger but all in all, they are very nice glasses!"
I love these glasses. They are sturdy and easy to hold. There is no indention on bottom of glass that holds water from the dishwasher. They look crystal clear coming out of the dishwasher. Planning on ordering another set. Highly recommend.
"These are the best plastic glasses I've found. The ones that I replaced were smaller, and not as wide. These are great. And, unlike the ones that I replaced, these haven't discolored or gotten scratched looking from the dish washer. They look like glass, until you pick it up and see that it is light weight. I've run them thru the dishwasher ""maybe"" 10 times...and still look like new."
"Bought these for use in the hot tub where glass is a bad idea. Been through the dishwasher a few times, not getting cloudy or scratched up yet. So far exactly what I wanted. I also have 4 in a portable bar I built for traveling. Perfect uses for these!"
"I love using these over glass cups. They look exactly like regular glass cups but don’t break when I look in their direction. They do get some scratches, but nothing too noticeable after a couple months of use."
"I bought these plastic glasses because I needed new ones and wanted a set that looked like glass. These glasses definitely look like glass; they are plain yet pretty, easy to hold, have a sturdy base, and wash up well in the dishwasher. I'm delighted with them and may order another set."
I use these for toothbrushing cups for my whole family. I run them through the dishwasher and they've held up very well. This is my second set. I suppose they'd be good for drinks too.
My toddlers have both dropped these a few times. One did chip and get a huge crack in it but I could hear that cup smash against the floor from the upstairs bedroom. If it was glass it definitely would have been a nightmare
"I bought two sets of these tumblers, both the 12oz and the 20oz sizes. When washed side by side in the same dishwasher, the 12 ounces ones have a cloudy film on their surface while the 20 ounces don't. they both say dishwasher safe on the package, but during the dishwasher process one (the 12 oz) is either leaching out something on its the plastic surface (possibility a plasticizer, or it is letting a soap film adhere to its surface, or something else is happening which I do  As far as I am concerned none of these possibilities is a very appetizing thing. Which in and of itself is not a good thing when it comes to food grade (supposedly pasticizer free drinking containers).not understand, while the other (the 20oz tumbler) is not, this one remains clear when subjected to the exact same conditions."
"These were used for a water table activity in a preschool setting. They held up perfectly, even when dropped. I would purchase again."
I loved the slimmer glass since I have very small hands. The glasses wash up beautifully and are very affordable. I will buy this product again.
First the good thing is they are not breakable and have not shown any cracks as a eight piece set that I purchased before did
"I really like these drinking glasses their clear, light even with liquid in them. I haven’t run them through a dishwasher cycle, but they are easy to rinse out by hand."
Good item for around pool
"So glad we switched to these glasses,they have the feel and look of glass and are so much safer."
I only just received them so can't comment on their durability
These are great glasses for use in the bathroom or by the spa. The size is generous and they are easy to hold. I highly recommend them.
"These are nice glasses that will NOT break as they are a very thick plastic material. Live that they look like regular glass cups. As a household with kids and pets, nice things do t last so like that we can have fake, nice looking ones without having to fear the breakage."
These are great plastic glasses. They are as clear as glass but much lighter.
"Glasses are crystal clear, people think their glass until they hold them"
They are wonderful. Look like glass great for around the pool. I would hand wash. So happy with these glasses
Very nice quality. Ordered 6 and ordered another 6. Great glasses!!
I like that it is hard to break them and they still look kinda like glass.
"The glasses look as elegant as glass, but lightweight and easy to hold. They don't seem to sweat and drip. I really like them."
"Love the real-glass look, and the ease with which they can be held!"
Look good an the perfect size!!
Washed very nicely in top rack of dishwasher and love the size of these cups! Perfect for dining outside and not so light that they feel cheap.
Perfect. Durable. Fashionable. Love them
Just what I wanted!
"These are exactly what I was looking for the perfect size for juice, milk etc. my 10-year-old. And they look like real glass!"
These are awesome
"Smooth glass rim. Unlike some of the other acrylic glasses. Also, a bit taller then the other acrylic glasses I have ordered in the past. Love these."
"I was looking for a plastic glass which has some elegance and these are it. They have stayed unscratched, after many washes in the dishwasher, and they look crystal clear. I love them."
Love the new glasses and my family does too. Ordered an extra set to have on hand.
"They look great, hold up well and are dish washer safe!"
Exactly as advertised! Very clean and clear.
Good quality. Price is very right. Would definitely buy again .
"Bought to replace cheap kids cups and they made the cut! I even dropped on onto tile flooring from counter height with virtually no damage. They’re great for my kids, who notoriously hold cups single handed and often spill. They NEED to use two hands for these cups so I have far fewer accidents. They’re dishwasher safe and they have a very basic look. The plastic does retain dishwasher spots, but I also don’t use a rinse aid, nor do I hand dry out of the dishwasher."
"Nice glasses, they look like glass and are very sturdy. As they wash and wear they start to loose their shine but they are a great value and even after they wear down a little they still look great"
These are great plastic glasses. We bought one set and then got more immediately. They are well made and seem to withstand the dishwasher well. Really like these glasses for plastic ware.
"can only stack two in my cupboard, was hoping for better stacking. but love the glasses. seem sturdy and the bottom is flat so it doesn't collect water in the dishwasher."
"This home up well. I have 7 kids and did not want to keep using cheap plastic cups but don’t want to run the risk of glass breaking. This look fabulous and even after many washes still look crystal clear. Side note, our dishwasher has been broke almost since we bought head cups so we have been washing by hand. Water still does get caught on the bottoms in the dishwasher so they don’t dry completely but not a deal breaker for me."
My kids managed to smash and break one. I will assume the went full donkey smash mode and therefore no cup could stand a chance. I have 4 stars bc they claim smash free. I think perhaps they need to add adult smash free bc my kids dominated the smash factor.
"They were great at first, but you were able to see imperfection with some air bubbles in the plastic. After few washes in dishwasher, top load only, they now have water resude that shows. Scratches very easily too. I wouldn't recommend. Buy something else."
"I really needed 12 glasses to have for when all of the family is here (nothing breakable, but still nice looking). I only ordered 6 to make sure I liked them. They're just what I was hoping for, so now I've ordered another set!"
"These look fantastic. Easy to hold. However, the box was dropped by my husband before we ever got to use them and they chipped pretty bad. Obviously, they did not shatter like glass would have but the edges are very sharp.. I will order another box tho because we have concrete flooring and they are way more durable than glass!"
"Great glasses! They look like they are glass, but are not! Easy to clean! I use them in my tasting room for water and still don’t have a scratch after all the washes."
"I needed a few more cups since a few of my glass ones had chipped. These seem to fit the bill. I threw one onto my laminate floor a few times and made sure it hit rim first. No chips or deformation, can't tell it ever happened. They could stack a bit better, but they stack well enough to put 2 on top of each other in my cabinet without hitting the top. They seem pretty durable, though I am able to scratch the plastic with my teeth, so don't chew on them, lol. Seem like they should last a few years.  Update: They've gone through the dishwasher a few times (top rack only) and they are just fine. OTOH, they are very soft, so not use a normal kitchen half sponge half green scouring pad on them or it will scratch them up. Reduced a start for softness.  Disclaimer: I was provided the product to review, but was also in need of the product."
"Everyone at the house loved these when they first arrived, but very quickly they have fogged and scratched. Will continue to use, but not for guests."
"Large enough for plenty of ice and 12 oz. of drink, but easy grasp for smaller adult hands. Although they do not stack, they fit nicely in in my limited cupboard space.. While they do not stay totally clear, like glass, using the top of my dishwasher, neither do they break on my stone countertop. Family members prefer these over heavier glass."
Perfect for families. I myself am to clumsy to have real glass and I don’t like the taste of drinks in plastic cups (weird- I know) . This plastic seemed is sturdier and so clear like glass- no one would know it wasn’t! Will order again!
These are very nice! No one knows they’re plastic until they pick them up! They’re perfect and we don’t even use our glass cups anymore!
"Probably my favorite cups so far! They look so nice, clean very easily and they look alot like their glass neighbors. It's hard to believe they are plastic. I'll be buying these probably from now on over the other cup options."
"Still after a couple months and lots of use in the dishwasher, they still look great. I use them a lot for iced coffee that I want to take outside. It does look like glass too, well made."
"The're just as displayed on line, feels good in your hand and has limited sweating when used for cold drinks."
These are durable and attractive glasses. I bought another set as my family likes them too
"Came in a box of 6, 5 were good and the one pictured here was already shattered. Outside seller -so not easy to return for a replacement. Cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. The other 5 good ones will work, glasses for the grandkids. We will see how long they last."
I am very happy with these glasses. I even bought a second set. They look like glass and come out clear from the dishwasher.
Bought these glasses for my 95 year old father. Easy for him to grip and carry. Excellent quality. I am very pleased with these glasses.
I have owned 3 different brands of this same style plastic glasses and this is by far the best. This one has thicker sides/bottoms and feels substantially better in the hand. The bottom is just barely cupped so trapping water when in the dishwasher is not a problem. Highly recommended.
I love the real look of these. They wash well. Only have 4 stars for durability because I’ve not had that long but so far they look up to the challenge. My whole family likes these and I may order another set. Exceeded my expectations. You won’t be disappointed.
"The glasses are fine. Perfect for outdoors, when eating outside."
I like the glass look and the peace of mind that when my daughter drops the cup it doesn’t shatter.
"Our dishwasher leaves water spots on these (but not on our other ""real"" glasses). Easy enough to hand wash them."
I wanted something unbreakable that looked good. These fit the bill.
"They look like glass, but are straight up plastic! No cracks, breaks, or sweating onto my wooden surfaces! Trust it enough to get rid of the kids cups and give em the 12oz cups!"
Very sturdy and also pretty. They don’t look like plastic and wash well in the dishwasher.
Needed a set of utility glasses for low end every day use these were perfect nice looking easy to handle
These beverage glasses are tough and hold up great .
Great choice. Perfect around the pool and patio.
I'm always in search of pieces that won't break when they either slip out of my arthritic hands or get knocked to the ground when we're outside. These fit the bill.
I realized that i spend to much money on Starbucks coffee- on me and my teens--- So my husband got me a ice coffee machine for xmas and now these cups are what i use for ice coffee. Everyone gets a kick out of it. The money i spent on these 100 cups and lids is less than what i would have spent on 1 order with Starbucks. Best investment ever!
Did a lot of research on cups. I came across these with great reviews on them. So I ordered them.They came package perfectly! The cups are sturdy and thick. Not cheap plastic like other cups I've come across. My wife needed almost 30 for my daughters class. The rest she uses for her ice coffee and tea. We will be ordering again. Thanks for the great product!

"I decided to make my own cold brew coffee at home. Part of the ""fun"" of getting coffee to go is the cup. If you leave it somewhere it is not a disaster. I decided to get 100, 20 ounce cups to see if they would function for my new cold brew coffee habit. So far they work well and I have not had any spillage or ill fitting lids. I feel I can save time and money making my to go coffee at home and commuting with it."
Arrived on time. The cups and lids are sturdy and the lids click tight to the cup. It seems like the plastic is thicker than a normal cup you'd find. They were well made. We accidentally ordered the 16 oz instead of the 8 0z. but we made it work. Would recommend this product.
"I am absolutely loving these! I bought them so I can take my morning protein shake on the go with me and then not have to worry about washing out the cup after a long day of sitting. I was super impressed that the lids snap on easy but still have a good tight fit. And then the way the hole is cut for the straws, they go in easily but are secure and should my cup turn sideways, the liquid is not pouring out of the straw hole. Over the weekend, I even fixed a drink in one for my 3 year old grandbaby when I couldn't find her sippy cup and it worked great!"
I LOVE these for my grandkids. I was constantly sending my cups with lids home with them because they were in the middle of drinking something when their parents came to get them or they were suddenly thirsty when it was time to leave. They’re perfect for little travelers and saves mom or sad the time and expense of stopping to get them something to drink. Water bottles are also good but we have a drinking water service and don’t typically purchase water in bottles so these little lidded cups are the perfect answer.
I bought these cups to put my cupcakes in and they were the perfect size.
Made s’mores cups in them for my teenager’s beach party! I put a sticker over the straw hole.I have since been using the remainder for snack cups (chopped up watermelon and veggies) and making jello concoctions to keep in the fridge. I may just keep buying these because I’m kind of addicted to jello now....

"I really like these cups. They are high quality and durable, as good or better than what you would get from places like Starbucks. So easy to make an iced coffee at home and take it on the road. I can brew K-cup coffee directly into one of these plastic cups filled with ice. A small warning--the lids can get stuck together very tightly, sometimes almost indistinguishable from a single lid. Almost like the way you have to separate paper plates. Anyway, they are a bit pricey and almost too good for everyday use, but they are awesome cups and I'll probably buy them again."
"Used these for strawberry lemonade for a Pink Lemonade themed baby shower! Everyone loved them and the sturdiness of these cups. Lots of reviews about lids not matching up with the amount of cups all of the lids are there you just have to keep an eye for the couple that stick together which is why they won’t clip to the cup as well. I had zero issues with the lids attaching or being short cups or lids. These were perfect and leak proof, I had a couple tip over in the box I was transporting them in and had zero spillage. Its a bargain buy them!"
These are a life saver for our smoothies in the car on the way to school!! Great product!!
Not much to complain about. So I will tell you about what I liked. The cup seems to be sturdy and the cap stays on as well as you would like. My grand daughter actually dropped it and the cap stayed on. Pretty pleased with them.
"I’ve tried many iterations of these cups for my wife’s iced latte in the morning (send any hate mail about landfills to her, I’ve tried and she doesn’t listen, so I doubt she’ll care what you say). Anyways, so many of them stick to each other and I have to struggle to separate them. Not these! They separate perfectly and hold her drink without leaking."
"I use these everyday with my grandkids and their friends. The lids go on the cups easily and seal tightly. The shape of the cup is great for even the littlest of children. The price for 100 of these cups is a little bit of an initial investment, but the handiness of having 100 cups and lids around is wonderful. Great product."
"I love these! They're sturdy, and the lid is firm enough cause cats constantly knocked them over, but lid stayed on! I love straws and putting it in a cup it floats to the top, not these! I also like that I reuse them more for pop n juice so I don't thow them away as much, or wash as much. Love them! I took a picture of my organizer for cups. Everyone who's seen it bought one! And the dome top for whipped cream is great for ice coffee, smoothies, and ice cream shakes."
"Amazing little cups. About the size of grande at Starbucks. They are thick (for plastic cups) and sturdy. I dropped one that was half full and it didn’t even open or break. I’m one of those people that gets a plastic cup from Starbucks or anywhere and keeps reusing till it’s unusable so these were perfect. I bought a 30 pack of reusable straws to go with them. I keep them on my counter. I love to make random fancy drinks all day long, and these are perfect. When these 100 cups run out I will def buy more."
"I've truley enjoyed these cups for my smoothies. I make a smoothie every morning and i pour it in these cups to take with me to work. A lot of the reviews i believe i read complained about the cups sticking together and not being able to pull them a part...but I've not experienced that at all. And i almost didn't purchase these cups for that very reason. But I'm glad i stepped out on a limb and bought them anyway...because they've been just what i was looking for. I definitely recommend them...and will by buy more if i need them. Also, they are not flimsy at all in my opinion. The plastic seems pretty thick to me...and the lids don't come off easily either. I can pick it up by the lid and it doesn't pop off."
They were just want was need for a family reunion. Put stickers and labels on the cups. The kids all had a lid and straw. It was easy to keep up with your cup and the kids did too. The kids personalized their cups with fun stickers and markers. Spills were few because of the tops. Good tight fit and did not come off if knocked over. Everyone wanted to take one with them when they left. Will get them agin for next year
Perfect for toddlers hands. Just the right size for most straws. The price point a little off. I will keep an eye out for something a little more affordable.
"The lid is a little difficult to attach, but if you put your thumbs at 6:00 dand press down equally and move upward with both thumbs moving in opposite directions slowly you will see that the lid is attaching and when you are at the 12:00 position, you'll have to press downward a little stronger. That lid is not coming off until you want it to come off. Don't give up. You CAN do it. These are great for leftovers into the fridge. Love these cups and lids. I'm a happy camper,"
"We bought these cups along with a blender to replace my wife's jamba juice addiction. originally the smoothies weren't living up to her expectations but she says once in a cup with a lid like this it tastes better. We used to spend a lot of money every day on jamba juice, with these cups my wife is able to break her addiction and save us lots of money, on gas too. Other than that they seem quite sturdy for the price, and are a good size for what you want to be drinking on the go. Again, probably bad for the environment but saving us a lot of money and time."
"Got my order in good condition and packaged carefully. The 16 oz cups are the perfect size for me--not too small, not too big. When I received them, I decided to put them to the test right away and made some boba drinks. I like that the plastic is sturdy, not the cheaper kind that is flimsy so it dents easily.  Will order again when I run out. :-)"
I use these small cups to monitor how much my mother drinks. She is a cancer patient and we have to try and push fluids. 10ounces at a time and she can have a couple different things to drink at a time and there’s little concern of a huge mess if she drops one.
"I use these cups for taking my iced coffee to go. The cups are actually really thick and sturdy, even better than my coffee shop, and the lids fit perfectly. Currently haven’t experienced any leaking or issues with capping, although I haven’t been using them for long and capping issues can happen with every lot. Well worth the money and should last me a long time. Normal size straws will fit perfectly and a wider straw can be used for smoothies."
"Good deal for a large quantity of cups. I like to make my own drinks to go in the morning to save money. These are super convenient to grab and use on the run. I save a ton of money by making my own drinks. If I didn't have these cups, I wouldn't be making them at home. I haven't had a single issue with the cups or lids. I bought some disposable straws to go along and I'm good to go."
"These are my healthier lifestyle indulgence.  I refuse to pay for overpriced coffees and smoothies, but missed having portable drinks to take on the go.  With these, I make my drinks at home, pour them into these cups, pop a lid on, add a clear straw, and feel like I just picked it up from a coffee or smoothie shop.  I love it because I save money and control what ingredients are used."
They arrived in two days. There are no straws but I knew it so beware if you need straws. My kids are using them to take water or cold drinks like ice coffee or tea to school. They say they are happy with them. I sometimes reuse them if they had water in them or if they bring them back. I hand wash them so don’t know their durability in the dishwasher. You have to separate the tops carefully. I’m glad I purchased those cups and tops.
These cups are sturdy when being held in the hand and the lids on these are airtight. I use them for my breakfast and lunch meal replacement smoothies everyday. The thick smoothie disposable straws fit perfectly in these straw holes!
"I bought these for a birthday and used for pasta salad, potato salad and fruit! They are a perfect size and a huge plus that they come with the lid. Definitely the best price for the size and quality! Will purchase in the future when needed!"
"I usually use reusable cups but couldn’t stand how gross my smoothie left my cups, so i ordered these. Maybe not as environmentally friendly, but way more convenient for my on the go breakfast. The best part is that If tipped, the kids stay secure and do not leak out the sides...i would definitely order these again"
"I ordered these cups to use for my sons Valentines that he wanted to make after seeing a picture of cups filled with goodies and pencils as straws. I loved how sturdy the cups are because he was able to personalize and decorate each cup with markers without the cup giving under the pressure of the marker. I also likes how tightly the lids sealed, I don’t have to worry about them popping off and everything spilling in the box on the way to school. I’m super excited that I have tons left to use all summer long while hosting on my patio because the quality is fantastic so they will be a staple from now on in this house!!"
"They showed up just fine, a lot more sturdy than expected. A few of the lids are stuck together but they can be pulled apart and used still. Friends 1 year old baby threw one to the floor, was about 1/4 full, only a few drops made it out of the cup and the lid stayed on. She threw it pretty hard onto tile from a high chair."
"Wanted to serve fruit at a Covid-friendly brunch for a Ladies Bible study gathering at church. A fruit bowl always looks nice, but we decided to make individual fruit cups with lids. Our ladies felt comfortable having buffet service with all the food options individually wrapped. It came as close as possible to being ""back to pre-Covid serving."" The fruit cups were sealed, the fruit stayed fresh, and it was easy to see what was in the fruit cup! This was a very sanitary way of serving fruit and we'll do it again!"
"These are the best cup containers I have found by far! The kid remains on and although they have the straw hole they really don’t leak. I’ve made EVERYTHING in these cups, fesa con crema, chamoy nuts, banana pudding, strawberry shortcake…you name it. I gave some to a friend and not only did I order more but so did she!"
"Used for the holidays first, and then decided I needed to use the leftovers for something other than next Christmas, so I use them for my homemade cold brew coffee. They're amazing, and I have zero complaints. I recycle them, but my in-laws have actually hand-washed and reused them several times. Very happy!"
"I use these every day, everywhere ! Iced coffee .... Iced flavored water...soda. Toss when I done. Best ever !! The only advice I have..is to make sure the lids are separated . they stick together so so tightly, you don't want to waste w lid when u begin to get low on cups. it's sometimes very hard to notice they are stuck. Othwrwise BEST cup ever. I will purchase again !"
"So glad I found these. Last time I bought something like this, it was from Walmart.com. I was for half the quantity and around the same price. So thank you Amazon for an amazing deal!! These are perfect for on-the-go homemade smoothies or iced coffees, and not having to worry about bringing & then forgetting my own cups."
"No complaints here! They are as to be expected. Sure, there are a few lids that were a little warped but overall these cups serve their purpose for me and my family. Great to go cups for home, iced coffee or road trip pick me ups! They aren’t Starbucks thick, but they are good."
They can get a little expensive if your kids don’t try to take care of them but I am very pleased with their quality. I am on my second order and I will order again when needed.
"These were perfect for serving individually packaged cupcakes in! We placed the cupcake on the lid and used the cup as a dome. They were just the right size. Some of the lids were difficult to get on, but once on they were fine. Cupcakes were carried around and the lid stayed secure."
I ordered these for a baby shower. I decorated the cups with Cricut vinyl and they came out perfect. They are on the smaller side but I used one the entire party and it was perfect.
"I highly recommend these! Not only are they sturdy, they’re also leak proof!!! Usually when my toddler drinks from cups like this she’ll tilt it while drinking and it’ll leak or spill, but not with these! I’ve even given red smoothies and there wasn’t a drop - Unheard of!!!!! Definitely better quality than any one I’ve got from restaurants for drinks."
"Honestly I say 5 stars for durability because although I haven’t had them long, they are so sturdy I feel confident saying they will have durability despite the fact they are disposable. I bought them for to go drinks for my grandkids but since they are so nice & sturdy I have hand washed them & kept them for another use. Definitely a good deal for the money for me since I expected disposable and these are very nice! Definitely will purchase again when I need to!"
Arrived super fast. A few of the kids are stuck together but it’s not a big deal. They all fit on the cups and nothing is cracked.
"Now I make my own espresso, add to my favorite coffee, throw in some ice, and head out the door to work. No need to stop and wait in the long line at that coffee place where I will also be out $6.50. Folks at work stop me and ask, ""hey, did we get a new coffee place in the building?"" Oh..I purchased the straws from Amazon also. Convenient."
"These are great for my toddler! Daycare has requested disposables for meal time due to new COVID protocol, and these are perfect. 10 oz is a good size for her little hands, and she's definitely drinking more water now that she has a fun cup and straw. Lids stay on and don't leak. Very pleased!"
"I was ordering iced coffee everyday, just by habit, once I ordered these cups I started creating my own, I’ve saved so much time and money!"
"I use these cups frequently and am impressed with their quality. The cups have never cracked in my experience, as some other plastic cups might. They are a good size and can easily fit a whole drink with plenty of ice cubes. Sometimes 2 lids will stick together and it is easy to miss- keep an eye out for this so that they do not go to waste."
I have reused the same cup (cleaned by hand) for a week now and I think it'll last much longer. I like them. It's like having a solo cup (maybe a wee bit more flexible) with a lid. I like it because I can drink my water outside without having to worry too much about flying insects landing in it. I do recommend these cups and lids. I had no problem inserting a straw.
Large & water tight. My son uses these to drink in bed. I used to lose his reusable cups & they would mold & get gross. These are just easier
"I've ordered these twice now. I use them at work primarily. As I drink water all day at my desk, there is no risk of knocking over a drink and spilling all over my desk. Every night I bring home the empty cup and recycle it with my recyclables.I've found I've haven't gotten sick as often, by using a fresh cup everyday"
Love love this product! My go to for my ice coffees saves money and time on Starbucks!
So I absolutely love the cups! I’ve brought them two times now because I love drinking out of these cups BUT they are not 20oz cups more like 16oz. A full 16.9 oz water bottle can fill the cup up to the top or 16.9 fl oz of sprite fills it up but the extra 4oz are definitely missing in the size of the cup! Just be aware of that but other than that great cups.
I used these cups to put frozen daquries in for our party.i made 50 of them like 4 days b4 the party that way I wasn't stuck in the house all day. Making daquries. Worked out perfect!
They cups were fine for cold beverages and frozen drinks. These were used for a smoothie sale. The only issue was that the lids were stuck together and thin enough for you not notice. I was 7 lids short by the end of the sale
"I totally love these cups. Although they are plastic and supposed to be disposable, I wash them and eventually reuse them. They gave prevented many spills."
These cups and lids are fantastic. They hold up extremely well. They were perfect for my elderly Mom to drink from daily. We even have put them in the dishwasher to get extra use. At least 2 washes. I would highly recommend for the elderly and children especially if you are headed to someone's house and you do not want to bring your reusable cup. I used bendy straws which was easier to drink from for Mom.
These are great for outdoor parties especially when you serve drinks with sugar. Keeps the bugs out and your drink safe. I also keep some in my room for water during the night and juice. I love them
These cups were very durable and easy to assemble. My little cousin used them for his lemonade stand at a large event and they worked perfectly.
"Purchased twice. 5 stars both times.  I make my breakfast smoothy the night before and pour the smoothie in these to keep in the fridge till the next morning. Get the cup out in the morning, pop a straw in it and take it on the road. They are durable. Top is tight. So much so, I've used it as a shaker cup when my real shaker is dirty. I hold my finger over the cuts for the straw so that the seal doesn't break. It works! Great price."
"Perfect little cup with lid. Very clear, not cloudy. Snug little top. Will order these regularly. Great for lunch boxes and portable treats."
Love these disposable cups for my iced coffee! They never leak and they are the perfect size
I've knocked them over before and they didn't leak.i used them in the house for everyday use.they're great to reduce mess with smoothies too
I don’t think I even realized the amount I ordered but they were good quality for a good price. I use them every morning for my teenager’s protein smoothies. I learned my lesson about letting them take reusable containers to school. So while I may be super wasteful now at least i’ve Saved my sanity.
Small but perfect for kids party. They did not leak and they were a great way to show off the sharks 🦈 in the “ocean fizzy” drink for the themed drink!
We used these cups for my daughters Hamilton party. They were a hit!
We bought this for fruit and it works great I was our fruit and put it in these in the fridge and the kids just grab and go . Cheap enough I don’t worry when they just toss them
I love this size! I give my grandchildren this for their drinks at my house so they are not making messes everywhere. Nice for in the car also.
"Wow I was surprised at the quality! We buy a ton of cups for our employees, and most of the time, the cups are gone but we have a lot of lids left. So we just needed a good deal on a bigger quantity of just paper cups. This is a steal! It comes down to 17 cent a cup, which compared to other sellers, was cheap! Will be purchasing these on repeat! :)"
I bought these to use for my coffee. I can cut down on washing dishes. Call me lazy I know I am but I say the dishwasher says thankyou.
These cups are hard to find due to the supply shortages. I haven't used the cups yet but they look like just as I wanted.
"I’m a massage therapist and was sick of handing clients water in these flimsy cups that bend as soon as they make contact with water and only made up a sip of water. These are the perfect amount of liquid, maybe 3 gulps, and the cups are durable."
Very splendiferous quality. Packaging was ace. Delivery was immensely quick. A+++
The boxes they came in were sturdy . I ordered them for our social hour at my church
Nice quality paper. Not plastic lined. Perfect for little hands!
"Soooo many cups! Perfect for glue portions instead of glue sticks, perfect for quick water break for my 2-5yr olds, and perfect for simple crafts."
These cups come in handy for our water machine. They are the perfect size for children.
Good item for the price.
Love the size. I bought these to use at an 80th birthday open house. They were great except when using them for hot beverages like coffee and hot chocolate.
Surprised that a sleeve is not needed with hot beverage.
Does not keep liquids hot for long time
Nobody wants 5 cups at a time!
The cups leak. I tried to tell that to seller and they did not acknowledge the problem.
The cups all stick together
"This products leaks once there's coffee in it for a few minutes, using two cups at a time to get by. Can't leave coffee in it overnight, lol."
One use no refills. If you try to drink a second cup out of this or drink your first cup too slowly the seams will split along the side and bottom. Your first cup is just fine if you drink it relatively quickly. Otherwise it will leak on your furniture. We've used a full sleeve and it happens with every single cup.
Use it for water not for coffee or buy coffee cup heat holder
It says hot and cold but the hot is just too hot to hold
"Cups are packed to tight, can't be used in dispenser."
"Arrived ahead of schedule, all good condition, in sleeves of 50 wrapped in plastic. These will replace the dixie cups I usually buy, as those are no longer being produced. Sturdy basic cups for use brushing teeth."
Been using in my preschool classroom. Works great for those who need a drink or to hold some paint or to scoop out snacks.
"We were looking for a replacement for the cups we've been getting for many, many years that are now hard to get. Took a shot with these and we are satisfied with the value and quality."
Great set for my 3 and 5 year old. They can easily hold them and they fit in their car seat cup holders. Fun way to get them to drink all their water for the day and a lot of fun colors to pick from.
Great cups for the price! Color changing works well and they come with straw cleaning tools. The kids in my son's class loved them! The lids are nice and tight also!
These cups with lids and straws are the perfect size for my homemade smoothies and protien drinks. We love the color changing!!
My kids loves these
there really pretty and good quality
Love how they change colors
Muy bonitos y seguros para los niños
My kids love these cups! They love to mix the tops and straws with different color combos. Easy to clean and quick and easy to make a drink for the kids

The cups are great for what I was doing. I cut employees names out of vinyl for each cup. I was surprised at how nice they are for the money. Only complaint is the green and teal are NOT color changing or as vivid as the other colors. Not a huge deal as I didn’t need all of them.
"They work well and my kids love them. Downside was after going through the dishwasher(top rack) some lids didn't fit as snug on different cups. I think the heat affected them ever so slightly, but not visible to the naked eye. Some still will click tight on other cups, so you just have to try until one is snug. Everything washes nicely."
"I really hoped ALL the colors were as vibrant as the photos. I had good luck with most colors but some were kind of blah! I bought 2 sets as favors. First photo is one set filled with cold water, second photo is after I dumped out the water, and third photo is the second set filled with cold water. The colors that were really vibrant were the yellow, teal, dark blue, pink and gray. The not so great colors were red, orange, green, and purple. Also, both packs had 2 of the cup cleaners but none of the straw cleaners. I will be customizing them so hopefully the kids don’t mind too much!"
Not very sturdy product. Drops can make tops pop off. Straws are easily chewed after one use.
Nice cups but child size.
Love the cleaner tools that come w/it. Colors aren’t as vibrant as I thought but definitely looking forward to using them more for the spring and summer time.
UPDATE! Very responsive and made sure i was hapoy. They sent me another pack that changed colors! Great customer service. !!!!  3 of them look the same added cold water to get some change and barely nothing and it's been 2 hours my other 4 changed but these nothing
I just bought these cups and after one use the lids won’t stay on with certain cups. I have not put them in the dishwasher yet so I’m not sure what could have happened. My daughter really liked this set so I’m disappointed to have to return them.
"Absolutely not color changing. Most dull or gray But I actually wasn’t concerned about those features… Received 6, but the lids pop off of 4. Only 2 actually snap shut. Unfortunately, I found this out after my daughter‘s cranberry juice stained her linens & mattress."
The color of the cups do not look like the picture. They barely change color at all and the colors are very dull. The quality of the cups seems to be good and long lasting. I just wish the colors were as bright as the picture.
The color are so pale nothing like the picture
Everything is good!
Followed directions and they did not color change color as expected. I bought 3 boxes. Now I need to open and test each box? Or just send back and try another brand?
Does not change color.
You can hardly notice the “color” change. Kids were unimpressed with them.
Kids love them!
This set is great! Pretty colors and the color changing effect is fun.
These cups are adorable. Change colors when cold. Easy to add personalization if interested.
Perfect
Gave these out for my son's birthday and they loved it
I bought these for my employees during housekeeping Appreciation week and they loved them. The color change is really vibrant and we’re a big hit !!!!!
These don’t change color and they are not the colors that were advertised. Very disappointed.
"One two three Now, red solo cup is the best receptical For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals And you, sir, do not have a pair of $$$$$$$ If you prefer drinkin' from glass Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable And in fourteen years, they are decomposable And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable Freddy, mac, can kiss my $$  Thanks Toby for a great song, and thank you red solo cup for being there. You're my friend....... :)"
It's a great one time use of disposable cups. No need to wash these cups after a party. Just throw it away.
Fair price for bulk
"great cups for price, many uses"
Sturdy and easy to hold
Works for me.
Little expensive but always a good product
It is just right for outside
Great item
There cups
"These get used as snack holders, cereal bowls. They hold ice cream, apples and of course drinks. Nice and sturdy."
They are a decent thickness & sturdyk ft
Perfect size for long roots. Easy to drill holes in bottom. Washed and reused without cracking or breaking.
Extremely glad to have this brand available again!
As advertised
Love Them
Best ones yet.
Great products
"What a deal! 200-18oz Solo cups for a very reasonable price. They are excellent quality-not the least bit flimsy. They do not 'cave in ' when picked up or held. When sitting on a table or counter, there is no wobbling from side to side. They're comfortable to hold. My husband whined about the square shape for a few minutes the first time he used one. (can we say 'diva'? LOL) He quickly got over it and uses the cups without complaint.  Now that summer's here, we'll be using these more than usual. Perfect for picnics, camping, a day at the beach, parties or if you're just sitting outside enjoying the summer weather."
"These cups were used, not new. This is disgusting. A few example pictures are provided. All of the cups have a strange film on them. It took me a while to realize it is dish washing detergent. They were used, then washed, then repackaged and sold to me. You can see from the pictures that some are dirtier than others, but who wants to have to wonder whether their cups are even usable. One looks like it has blood in it (see picture). Totally disgusted and because it took me a while to realize what was sent, the return window has now closed. I won't buy anything like this again from Amazon - lesson learned!"
"I like these cups but let us consider the name. Assuming Normal human behavior you will find these cups at social gatherings. If someone happens to be “Solo” at that very moment, whether friend or relationship wise, they are not going to like the name. Secondly red cups are the most spilled cups in the World. Someone is going to inevitably spill these cups. And they are going to blame this company, and Solely this company. Why? The space where they could have added extra grip strength instead has the name “Solo” twice. The other 2 sides have “grip dots” but not all 4. A very unfortunate design that should be changed."
Our favorite disposable cup. Squared bottom makes it not so easy to accidentally get knocked over.
Use these daily
"These big red cups are absolutely awesome. They have a great grip to them and they fit perfectly in my hand. They are very sturdy and they never have given way while I was holding them; whether they were full of liquid, or not much liquid at all, they held up perfectly and stayed perfectly in shape. These cups have no plastic smell to them and the red and white colors look very nice on the table. If you are looking for an awesome cup for yourself, or for your whole family, these are the ones you want. Thank you to the inventors of these cups and also I would like to thank Amazon for selling such an amazing product. Peace and love from Sky.:)"
My red solo cup. I’ll fill you up.. let’s have a party!!! Shipped with no issues. Will buy again.
Tried store branded red and white 18 oz cups from the big box CLUB stores. Did not want to feed thru nicely like the Solo cups do. So I will only be using Solo branded cups from now on.
Of all the different types of cups I have purchased these seem to be the best. The square bottom creates much less spills. Great cup!!!
"Have stood the test of time. From my college days to my 40s, solo keg cups are always there for you"
SOLO is the premier high quality brand of plastic cups and these are a great buy
Solo makes the best disposable cups. I don’t know why I keep forgetting that and purchase other brands.
These are covered in an oily substance and it makes them slippery to hold.
50ct per pack.... not shorted at least 7 cups
"All the cups have a greasy, oily substance on them. I got the 200 count and would not recommend buying these cups at any price."
Fast shipping.
Throwing my daughters “red solo cup” themed 21st birthday party and was so excited to be able to get the real cups that still have “solo” on the sides! It’s all in the details right! Lots of cups in one box and they came super fast!
It is a Solo cup. How can it be bad. Lol Great product
"They are sturdy, dependable, and hold up better than other brands"
Will buy again
I bought these cups for a party and was completely disappointed as half of them had holes in the bottom. As you can imagine we didn't realize immediately and had quite the mesa to clean up.
Just what I wanted.
For the most basic order I have to say They came in so quickly and I’m very pleased!
These cups have a film of grease on every single cup! It is nasty! Threw all 200 out!
Some cup was crack from deliver
I used as drinking cups for the house
I like the product but took too long this time three weeks to a month. So I probably won't order them again
Good price for the case!
Everything was fine
I buy solo because I trust the brand. These cups slowly leak everywhere. Disappointed.
Convenience.
I enjoy my solo cups. Don't go through as many glasses to wash this way.
Lasted a while and strong cups will be buying again
waiting for wedding
Holds up well enough to wash and reuse.
Excellent cups!
Perfect
Just what you’d expect
I love the color
They are the only plastic cups to buy.
Great for Beer Pong !!!!
Thanks
Love them
I can’t tell you how many times these things have gotten knocked over. Don’t buy!
Supposed to be 200 cups got 150.
All of the cups are covered in an oily substance making it nearly impossible to hold them without dropping.
Ordered the 200 count and only got one bag with 50 cups.
"Keeping a stash of the iconic red plastic Solo Cups is almost a must for any serious party planner or for just anytime use too. My wife typically keeps a stash of party favors for backyard BBQs, get-together's, kid's parties, or just whatever comes up and that's where the cups we received went.  Solo cups are probably the best known of the disposable cups out there and the squared version of the Solo cup looks just as you'd expect and is a bit easier to hold too.  Before ordering there are a few things to consider - Solo cups aren't the cheapest but are probably the best of the disposable/recyclable cups. Also, Solo cups are recyclable though they're made from polystyrene. Each cup is stamped at the bottom with '6' so they may or may not be accepted through your recycling program (you'll have to check).  Great cups! Recommended!"
"My husband recently bought some Hefty Plastic Cups so I am comparing Solo them. Hefty cups are terrible. They stick together and I had tug to put one out of a group of three. When I pulled, they cracked on top . Two cups were terrible but the one at the top had three cracks. Solo cups come apart easily., no cracking and no tugging needed.  When I filled the Hefty cup, it threaten to tip over because the bottom is round and seems to be of thinner plastic. Solo cups are very stable because of of the four sided bottom.  Solo are much easier to grip because they have an indention on each side. There is no place to grip the Hefty cups, they are completely round from top to bottom.  I do wish that both brands were not recyclable. I do rinse out my cup when I am done and use the same cup all day. I do not buy paper cups because they do not hold up all day."
"Solo cup red squared plastic party cups are great, exactly what you would want and expect. These plastic cups are ideal for parties, traveling, camping, cup games, and everyday use. The quality is durable, the square bottom does make them easier to grasp, yet they still will fit in most cup holders. I do a lot of entertaining, so I like to use these disposable cups to make life easier. These are recyclable so that is helpful. These plastic cups are a winner! I like that these do not smell funny or fade in color like cheaper disposable cups I've used in the past. These are exactly what you would expect and want in this product."
The square bottom on the cup is an excellent selling point because the square bottom helps to stabilize the cup to resist spilling. I definitely recommend this product......
"I am totally in love with these plastic party cups! They're sturdy, and I like the square design. Not only does it make them look more unique, it makes them easier to grip and carry around. I usually buy Hefty cups, but I think I like these even better.  They're strong enough that you could use them more than once. I keep putting them in the sink by accident, thinking they're a regular cup and not disposable. My subconscious mind wants to keep them forever."
I bought these to give out to my coworkers but my children like them so much I ended up keeping them. They're so fascinated with the color changing. They're definitely not leak proof as if it tips over the lid will pop off. They're very sturdy and easy to hold though.
I purchased for my student assistants
"Playful colors very nice piece and fun party, everyday use cups"
My daughter love those cups. We got those for her birthday party favors. Amazon made a mistake sent the wrong thing. Seller went beyond and extra to fix our problem!! Definitely will recommend to others!!!
These are so cute and love how they change colors!
"These are great. Cute sayings, comes with straws and straw brush. Love the color changes"
"Nice cups for everyday use, my 4 year old likes using them. Bought 2 sets and gave some out as gifts with candy inside."
These are so cute. They are sturdy and I love the fact that I can put a lid on it for my grandson.
This were a fun item to share with my daughter.
They are sturdy and color change works
Great cups. Just not such seal. Overall I’d purchase these again 🔍
The box contained only 5 cups. I might have kept them but the lids didn't fit tight and they leaked.
The cups are perfect size for a cool drink next to the pool. Also help kids keep up with their cups so less dishes for us! 😉JUST DONT PUT THEM IN THE DISHWASHER!
"The cups are nice and as stated, changes colors with cold liquid. I got these as return gifts for birthday party and the mix pack had 5 out of 6 girly colors. Wish they had half and half colors for boys and girls."
The kids love the way they change color.
NO
"Love the cups, Love the designs and love that it was a 6 pack because some came out broken-which sucks. My kids have there heart set on them and now it’s hard to pack them up and send them back to new get ones."
"I got these for my kids because they're always leaving open cups everywhere that eventually get knocked over. They're not 100% leak proof--I'd say more leak resistant. The color-changing part is really fun, too! I would definitely recommend getting these for around the house!"
These are not dishwasher safe so I wash in the sink. They come with a cleaner and a straw cleaner. They’re a good size for outside by the pool. The straws are a hard plastic that do not bend. The sayings on them are fun. They change color with ice etc. I like them.
There's color change cups are too cute. I got these for my kids but I use them too. We like to see the cup change with very cold water in it. These cups do need to be hand washed but 1 did make it into the dishwasher on accident and came out fine.
I got these as party favors for my daughter's birthday party. Everyone LOVED them and how they change color!
The cups could be better if the kids weren’t so hard to put on. You have to really press down hard to close the lids.
"Okay so these cups are like super cute, has that ombre type thing going on when you add something cold and when you put your warm hands around the cup it changes colors. Kind cool. Comes with 6 changing cups, 6 lids and 6 straws. I gave it 4 stars due to the lids. So the lids are snap on but once they fall over, the lid comes off and all of your drink will be on the floor but otherwise everyone in my house uses one.... it's 6 of us and the kiddos love it because of the color changing. I say Great buy!!"
"I use these daily and they are great cups. I kept losing my metal/ceramic/plastic to go coffee cups, so these are a great, cheap alternative, especially if you wake up late for work and don't have time to find and clean your other cups, which all require hand washing. At least they are paper and will break down in the landfill! I do occasionally rinse them out immediately after use and can use them again the next day, so they are sturdy enough to be used a few times without them leaking or dissolving. 10/10 will buy again, although 100 cups will probably last me 6 months! That beats 6 months of finding and cleaning out cups everyday! Or if I have people over and they want espresso/lattes then I don't have a ton of dishes, or if we go outside I'm not worried about them breaking like ceramic/plastic ones do if dropped."
I bought these cups to warm chilled soda canned drinks to room temperature (microwave on high for 45 seconds) for I can not drink or eat chilled things. It is very easy and convenient. So I consumed these cups very fast and ordered them again and again.
"Life is too short to spend it standing over a dishpan, and plastic is forever. These paper cups are the answer. One cup lasts me all day. They are sturdy, nice-looking, and the right size for my hand and my coffee-maker. When company comes, an initial marks which cup is mine, or the kids can color on them. They come in a box so normally only a couple get crushed lips, and none in this last shipment came with a crushed lip."
These Cups work great I have used for hot and cold drinks i can write easily on the outside to label people's drinks. when using hot or cold i will double the cups to protect hand from heat. for Iced drinks the double insulated the drink and preserves any ice in the drink
"Nice quality paper cups, study, didn't leak thru, well packaged, good size. A little bit hard to hold boiling hot drinks in a single cup, but if you double up, that works. For the same reason, I would say it's not the best for insulating to keep your drink warm, but i don't expect any paper cup to be able to do that. It held up very well in the microwave though!"
"In the past I always bought paper cups in brick-and-mortar stores, so was not sure about buying them online sight unseen. But I am happy to report these cups are as good or better quality than those I have purchased previously. The cups are sturdy and leak-proof, even when I microwave water to high temperature for tea. And they shipped barely 12 hours after I placed order. Would definitely buy again from this seller."
For the price it is quite a nice cup I've used it for a hot coffee and left it in there for hours or sometimes a full 24 hours. Surprisingly the bottom doesn't pop out in the cup still holds up well. When you first hold it in your hand you would not think that but it does.
"For many years I could buy 20oz cups at the discount, big box stores. Then they gravitated to the 16oz size and I had to search to find the larger ones. Now with these I can again enjoy the larger size. I have ordered these for several times now and have never had a problem. I do use a sleeve when the water I use is too hot. The cups do control the heat, but the sleeve makes sure I don't feel uncomfortable."
I used these to make Jurassic world coffee cups for my son’s outdoor Camp Cretaceous birthday/camping trip! *I made fun stickers and put them on them for personal use NOT for resale*  I love how they came out and they were very sturdy and not too hot to the touch but kept our coffee and hot chocolate very hot!
"I take my final ""cup of joe"" with me in the AM and don't use a travel mug as they all end up at my office full of nasty stuff because I forget to take them home. For years I used the Styrofoam version of this cup but really wanted a more environmentally friendly solution. This fit the bill. They are sturdy, not too hot to the touch and priced right. This will be a standard order for me!"
The cups work well. I use paper cups every day. I grab one cup in the morning and fill it up multiple times with hot coffee or tea throughout the day. These cups last all day with hot liquids without leaking. I am very happy with this product.
"We used them Thanksgiving and Christmas. They worked great, we bought the lids and sleeves also. They were easy to use, decorate, and mark names on."
My daughter uses them to put cereal in it or to heat up oatmeal on the go. Just put a packet of oatmeal in it. Add water or milk about half the cup. Stir it and heat it in the microwave for 45 seconds. (depends on your microwave how long)
The cups are sturdy and you can put both hot and cold beverages. However the cup is a bit hot when the hot beverage goes in. Sometimes I have to put a napkin around it to ease up on the heat for a short period of time.  However its not bad at all. I like the purchase.
Fill up your cup with hot coffee before leaving home to work. These cups are sturdy & keeps your coffee or tea hot. They fit firm in the car cup holder. I recommend these cups.
"Hubby kept forgetting his travel mugs at work or in the truck, now he always has a clean cup for his coffee on the go."
As expected in the description as we keep them in the break room so we can have cups available for our morning coffee.
"I could write home about these cups all day long! And they are so sturdy, so excellent, and easier to hold onto than the Solimo (Amazon brand). For the money, I didn't think they'd hold up either. Boy was I surprised immensely! They're great. I'll be ordering more soon to keep my stock of cups replenished."
We use these as we are horrible at remembering to bring the mugs back in from our morning coffee.... this has saved us so much hassle.... they are durable- they last all day. i refill mine multiple times. They dont have any issue with heat- we dont use lids so we ordered this on purpose but beware they do not have lids :)
"These hold the perfect amount of liquid, hot or cold, and don't come with lids that I'd not use anyway. There's room for ice, they fit in car cup holders without spilling, 16 oz. FOREVER!"
"Awesome cups, for warm and cold drinks. Just don't rely on them for reuse and long periods of time. The condensation from cold drinks weakens the cups quickly."
These work great for the price but you will need to put a sleeve on them because they are hot. I have a lot of extra lids hanging around so I use those because it does not come with them
"I refused to be washing cups all day long this summer! With the grandkids and their friends over all the time, these cups are a TIME & SANITY SAVER for me. They are much better than the plastic cups, not just for the environment, but more comfortable to hold with ice cold drinks, and little to no condensation rings! I believe we may start using these all year long!"
"Love these cups, perfect & sturdy They are the go to cup in our family. My family is always thirsty so we use these..plus -Less cups and glasses to wash"
I have problems holding things and so it is nice to have a light weight cup to hold liquid. They are sturdy.
"These are great cups. They're very sturdy. I use them for preparing instant oatmeal, which is cooked in the microwave, and these cups hold up extremely well."
Good quality cups. We use them for our hot drink machine (coffee and tea)
"I bought it for the office and we have used very few of this since they are very durable, sturdy and we don’t need to throw them away.... we just clean it, roncar it and re-use then again ( trying not to create more waste out there!) So it seems that these package would last forever."
"Great for 8oz pours with cream or 10oz pours with no cream for coffee. Sturdy, holds up, no leaks. It is a small cup so you have to be careful not to spill it."
Some employees use two at a time as they say the coffee is too warm for their hands. SIGH. maybe get the resuseable cup sleeves and give them out as needed.
"I use these cups for my morning coffee nutrition drink of collagen, chia, golden flax meal, coconut manna, with my preferred spices sweetened with raw honey! This flavor blend is protected by the integrity of the cup!"
Liked this one very much and will definitely be purchasing more. It is thicker than the ones I was using until now. Had to look for another seller/brand since it was almost impossible to hold the hot cup for more than a moment. These are better. Thank you
"Okay, if you pour boiling water in the cup your hand gets warm, quite warm. We switched to disposable cups at our headquarters because washing cups became a problem (no one washed them). I ordered about 10 other brands of cups before finding this one and am VERY pleased with them. We are sold."
"It's not styrofoam, I use them for upstairs coffee pot the kids use them for ice cream, pop anything they don't want to wash that fits."
"I use these to heat and eat soup, for tea, coffee and cocoa, and even food sometimes. They hold up just great, plenty durable.  I’m not sure why people would complain that they are hot to the touch when they put hot stuff in them...it kind of reminds me of the McDonald’s lady incident, placing a cup of scalding hot coffee between her legs, spilling the coffee in her lap, and then complaining that it burned her. Hmmm...these are cups for hot beverages, or even food on the go would work great. So...the thing is, these are disposable paper cups, not double-walled, insulated cups with a soppy lid. I usually don’t fill mine all the way to the top, that’s deliberate for me, I get a size bigger than I would need for most purposes, so things can bubble a bit in the microwave when I use them to heat things. I sometimes even trim it down an inch or two, depending on what I’m using them for; the lack of the rolled edge allows me to squeeze the edge into a pour spout and pour out of it more easily.  Hot things are hot, so I usually hold it by the top rolled or cut edge when whatever I have in it is still very hot. You would have to be careful of steam burns, if you need to be reminded that steam is hot, can burn, and tends to rise up. Or, when necessary, I just whip out some common sense right out of my back pocket, and take a piece of paper towel, fold it in thirds or fourths lengthwise, and wrap it around the cup if I really need the extra heat protection. If I really needed it to stay there, I’d slap on a piece of tape, too. Then, as the contents cool, I just use that folded piece of paper towel for a napkin, or I could even use it again for the same purpose.  The manufacturer is not marketing it as something with lids or something with a little extra landfill waste in the way of unnecessary heat protection, which I prefer not to have included. I rarely need it. A piece of paper towel can be are used for another cup wrap later, or for spills, crumbs from that snack that goes with the beverage, or even a nose. If people need the whole package deal, sippy cup lids and cardboard heat wraps,, they should buy that instead.  But if they are looking for some good, sturdy paper cups for their average hot beverages or even food, like noodles or leftovers or breakfast to go, and they don’t need the fussy extras, these are great. As long as they remain affordable, I will keep buying them.  Side note for those struggling with picking up just one cup from the stack... In the event that one cup doesn’t dislodge at there merest whisper of a touch, I just give the rim an ever-so-slight squeeze and a bit of a twist (it’s all in the wrist), and out it comes, effortless, no problem at all. For people that struggle with this, it’s probably preferable to have to nudge one ever so slightly than if they pull one cup which pulls a whole bunch of them out onto the floor because they’re loose and slippery.  Personally, I do not encounter any difficulties in using paper cups of any kind, and these are no exception. Sturdy, great quality, (the fact that they are marketed for hot beverages has nothing to do with whether or not people can hold them with their bare hands when they have put scalding hot liquid in it, it has to do with the cups holding up and not coming apart or melting when containing hot liquids, like a plastic or wax cup might and usually would do. They’re heavier and more sturdy than your average paper cup. That’s what they’re marketed to do, and they do the job just great!  So, for durability, I could reuse them and refill them a few times if I chose to do so, and if I drank that much coffee or tea in a day, I would. I have also used them for mixing test batches of natural hair dyes, with no leaking or staining of anything (but the inside of the cup, as it should be)."
The perfect size. I love the fact that they are white and don’t clash with with the decor of our house. I will certainly by these again
"I like these cups because they are very basic. Good size for my morning coffee. Not flimsy. I don't need lids, so I like that they don't come with lids."
"We ordered these cups to use at the coffee station we provide our clients. The plain white exterior projects a clean, crisp image. Most importantly, the cup is sturdy and durable...they stand up to hot liquids! Highly recommend the product and the seller."
Perfect cups for my use. Will continue to purchase them. I like to use these paper cups instead of Styrofoam.
Great cups
"These are strong, last me longer than Dixie cups, don't leak, and if you really wanted to, you could use them 2 days in a row. But... Dixie lids don't fit these well, the Dixie lids crack after 2 hours."
I order all the office supplies so these are great - I usually buy 500 to 1000 at a time as we are big coffee drinkers.
"I don't have a dishwasher, so I used to mix in some plastic cups to cut down on time and water use. Switching to paper as they're better for recycling. So far, so good with these."
Thick sturdy cups
"Great cups. Sturdy. Economically packed and priced. No bendy-sides when filled with hot beverages. No leaks. No chemical odor/after-taste as some of those can have. Biodegradable (bad enough to need disposable cups sometimes, but at least they won't litter for eternity). Will order this again."
Does the job
This is the second time we have ordered these. Will continue too
These cups are great to use for small and large parties. I always have a bunch on hand and they’re much easier than using mugs. The plan white is very classic and don’t feel tacky.
I love these I just wish they were cheaper
"holds most prized possession well, sturdy"
I like the value and the quality. Will but then again soon.
Perfect for mixing my epoxy in. Disposable so no clean up required. Very sturdy.
My kitchen sink was broken I need to switch to paper cups for a while. They are just godlike strong hot cups. I used them to pour hot water many times with the same cup. The shape of the cups never change. I even feel bad throwing them away because they still look new after use.
"Fast shipping; accurate product description. Suitable for any occasion. Affordable price for a quality product.  I used them for my daughter’s birthday party and for hot coffee & tea, as well as cold beverages."
Great durability and is great when you put jot fluid is great because it doesn’t burn your hands!!
"I have to drink Protein mixed with water three times daily. I use one cup for each day, and then throw it away. How easy is that?"
"Used these when I got home from hospital and couldn't lift ceramic coffee cups to drink soup, coffee, water etc. Work great around home sure would be great for your office also."
as expected
"I like these better than the 'red' cups because they are studier. Being transparent, the contents are visible and for some drinks people may not want that, but they do not 'dent' in your hand like the red cups can and you never feel they'll split or collapse. They look good on a set table if you want to use a disposable glass. I use them for morning smoothies, and when the kids visit and make SodaStream drinks, or want to take drinks outside."
"If you need lids, these cups don’t come with them. Fine for in house coffee and cold beverages."
Likely not much excitement in reviewing paper hot cup other than to say that they do the job and are priced competitively! Fast delivery as well!
they are cups
Love these for hot or cold beverages. This is my second order of them. I am not able to wash dishes at this time due to an injury. So morning coffee is their main use at my house. As long as they’re available I’ll be using them. I totally recommend
"Great for hot drinks. Cold drinks, not so much."
Worked well no issues
Nice for Keurig drinks
Cups are sturdy and can be used for both hot or cold drinks. Price was good also. Re-ordered these. Thank you
Like the sturdiness of this cup. We have used this cup for hot and cold beverages in our office.
These are great for the price. I customized them for the holidays with computer generated labels so we don’t have to drink out of tiny holiday coffee cups.
"exactly what we were needing, can get a little hot but is bearable. also works with cup tops for 12oz cups"
"My cups arrived super quick and none were cracked or defective. So cute looks exactly as pictured. I ordered glass straws to go with them. They are easy to clean they also survived in the dishwasher. I love these Idk bout anyone else but these are the little things that makes me happy. I used them for iced water, coffee and a smoothie. A great buy and I will definitely be purchasing as gifts for others."
"I bought these because I kept seeing them on tiktok, and I wanted to decorate them with cute designs. I did decorate them with my cricut, and I just love them! They feel a bit thin to the touch, but are definitely durable! I’m so shocked I haven’t broken one yet, because I’m so clumsy, but they are definitely going to scratch that tiktok buying itch! I love drinking iced coffee or beer out of them, it’s just a great shape glass! Thanks!"
I got these to put vinyl on for iced coffee. Super cute and good quality. Great quantity for the cost. Definitely recommend!
"I'm a year round cold beverage in the morning kind of girl, which is great until I needed to figure out what cup to use. Plastic cups? No thank you. Mugs are for hot only. Straws don't go in normal glasses. Enter: the beer can glass.  The shape and size is perfect for my chai boba floats (yes, I combine chai tea, boba, and ice cream for a morning drink) and whatever smoothie I can dream up. I got nice fat, short straws that fit proportionally very well in these glasses and I am quite satisfied. The top lip of these glasses is taller than I expected but it doesn't affect the use of the glass. Having 6 gives me the flexibility I need as a single person to avoid running the dishwasher everyday.  I have yet to use these for actual beer (obviously that's more of a pint glass thing) but I could see cute cocktail or a seltzer in the summer.  If you're weirdly particular about what liquids go in what glasses, get these. They filled a void for me and they can do the same for you."
Have only had around 2 months and bought due to them being reasonably priced and it held 12ozs. I noticed one was slightly cracked on the bottom but it wasnt super bad then today pulled a second one out of the dishwasher and it’s cracked pretty good
"We’ve loved them and used them a ton. Great quality, and they’ve been fine in the dishwasher. Not delicate at all. Nice for cold coffee and mixed drinks, but best if used with a straw because of the lip on the glass."
"Came in very fantastic condition, box was sturdy and ensured to keep it intact. Also thanks to the driver 🤜🤛 Highly recommend this 6 packs, they are legit and a value for the price given."
"Love these, perfect size, easy to clean, they look very nice"
The glasses were very durable
Cups were packaged nicely and it was obvious the seller put a lot of effort into their product and company which I appreciated. I haven’t had a chance to use them yet since we are saving until after we move but I love how big they are and are how durable they feel. I was worried they were going to be super thin but that’s not the case. They super cute and simple but not like every other glass you see
"Best bang for your buck! Looks beautiful and makes drinking anything out of it feel novel and fun! I won't say the glass is PERFECT, cause there are tiny parts along the top edge that are SLIGHTLY different (taller/thinner in some parts), but that is a plus to me because of the handmade feel it gives. Each glass feels unique to me, and I will absolutely be buying more of them in the future! If you're looking for this style of glass set, I'd recommend this one 100%!"
"I ordered these to decorate for Christmas, using vinyl, cut by my Cricut machine. They worked perfectly! Very smooth, virtually flaw free glass, and are holding up perfectly!"
Perfect for my small business
"I half expected these glasses to have the green tint that old coca cola bottles had, but was pleasantly surprised when I noticed they look more crystal-like than that. They look so clean, feel very durable and well-made, while keeping the thinness. overall, i’m impressed and satisfied.  the first and second photo were taken with a flash to show the crystal-likeness I mentioned and the last one is without but you can see the thickness/durability at the bottom of the glass"
"These glasses are EVERYTHING!!! They are so elegant and cute!!!! Get yourself a set, you won't regret it! They are so unique and fun to drink out of!"
I bought my third set do these and I love them so much! I love drinking out of them and my guest always compliment the cups.
Super cute! Looked high and low for unique drinking glasses and these are perfect. Have had them for 6 months now with no problem.
These glasses are the best and very durable! Many times I thought they would have broken in the sink or dishwasher but not at all! Also handles hot liquid pretty good as well! The glass straws also make this set even cuter!!! This is a must buy!!!!!
These are really cute!!! Would recommend. I bought little gold metal straws to go with these and i love it!
I’ve seen this style of glass all over Instagram and it just makes smoothies looks so Pinterest Perfect! Arrived timely and are just what I wanted to jump start my New Years Smoothie resolution!!!
They were a requested Christmas gift and the receiver loved them.
They’re thicker then expected which I didn’t think I’d like ! But being clumsy and hard when washing dishes they’re great !
These have a thicker/solid base. The sides are a bit thinner but they don't feel cheap by any means.
"The cups are larger than i expected and my other can cups! I have already broke 2 , one i accidentally set something down on the glass and it broke, the other knocked over onto the table and broke"
I use these for my Etsy business and they always arrive timely and in great condition !
"I love these! Can’t speak to the durability but so far they’re great. All 6 arrived without breaks or scratches, minor inconsistencies on some of the rims but that doesn’t bother me at all."
I used to buy libbey glasses from a different brand but these ones are way nicer! Will definitely buy more in the future.
I love these they are perfect. Light weight easy to clean I am definitely going to prefer more. I just love them. And they come with a very nice thank you note to boot
"Everything looks good in these glasses! And they’re a good size too, my new favorite cups:))"
If you're looking for a blank to add vinyl to this is a great one
"They are a very good quality and good design but they do seem a little thin, always afraid to possibly break them while washing"
"Very nice glasses, survived the dishwasher and have been knocked over and no cracks/chips. Love them!"
I’m in love with these glasses! They all came in safe & intact! Packaging was perfect!!! I recommend this vender & I will definitely purchase from here again!
Really nice durable not to thin not to thick perfect for summer drinks with alcoholic beverage or non alcoholic beverages had many compliments on them when sharing drinks with friends very impressed
These cups are extremely good quality. We have had them for 2 weeks with no issues. The style of them is perfect and very tasteful. We are pleased with our purchase!
Just what I needed!
Like everything about these glasses
Very sturdy. Beautiful glasses. Love them
Love them
""
I love these glasses because they are aesthetic but sturdy. I had broken so many of my old glasses and these were a perfect replacement. Highly recommend!
Very much like!
"I bought these glasses because they are cute, but was worried that they might be thin and would break easily. To my surprise, these glasses are quite thick and durable. They hold up well in the dishwasher. I love them and can’t wait to have a cocktail night with them."
I love the beer can glasses. So different in the design they are fun serving anything in them from water to beer! Lots of compliments.
These soda can style cups are very popular. The are perfect and remind me of when I go to local coffee shops. They are so cute and easy to clean. They are exactly as advertised.
"Despite some other reviews, all the cups came in perfect condition. I am very satisfied with the purchase, and would continue to buy from this supplier!"
Good size. Everything looks so cute in these adorable glasses!
Of course tik tok told me to buy these & it did not disappoint! Super cute cups!
They do not take up a lot of room. I would buy these again
These glasses are the cutest design ever. Dainty but durable and easy to wash.
"Love these stylish, trendy glasses"
Love the glasses can't wait to order more with a personalized touch. Easy to clean durable and a great buy.a
I loved them
"Love these glasses, easy to clean and perfect size."
Absolutely love these glasses! I use them for my smoothies and they are so cute.
Seen these on tiktok for Amazon must haves and they do not disappoint. Have a nice weight to them and they just look nice with a drink in them.
"I love these glasses so much and I’ve been trying to find ones that are like these, so when I came across them I just HAD to have them. 10/10 recommend"
They fit a lot (more than a standard can) and are so cute.
I’m glad I got these cups.
The package of six was delivered by USPS in a sealed sturdy package. Exceeded expectations! Item description was exactly what we received!! Thanks! Great Seller.
"I love these glasses! Perfect for a nice cocktail, iced coffee drink or a refreshing glass of water. They’re fashionable and sturdy!"
They came all perfectly packaged. They are a little thinner than I thought but still great quality!! I would say it’s similar to a wine glass in thickness. Super cute though!!
Iced coffee!!
Just received these cups yesterday and I am beyond happy with my purchase! The glass is super heavy duty which is a huge plus in my book. Love them!!!
Wonderful for iced coffee and very attractive and expensive looking
💛
Great size and shape. Seems durable! Can’t wait to use them.
I am in love with these. The perfect size. Very durable. I will buy more
really like these glasses! so cute and easy to clean!
"Unfortunately this will probably be returned. Only one cup out of 6 was up to standard. Some had weird lines in the middle, and 5 out of 6 has bumps on the rim so it’s not smooth. These were going to be personalized and then gifted but they aren’t well enough quality to gift…."
"These are really becoming a hot item and super hard to come by. My first order was great, great quality, good price. My second order the price went up a couple dollars, whatever, supply and demand I get it but once received the glass isn’t smooth and have small chips in it. As if production is rushing and taking short cuts on quality control to get them out ASAP. I came back to check and the price has increased OVER $10 from my first order! With the shotty new quality definitely not worth the price increase."
"I love the unique look and design of these glasses. They really do look like beer cans. They hold 16 ounces, so your entire beer will fit in the glass. I like to put them in the freezer, before I use them, so my beer stays frosty cold longer. It makes me feel fancy to drink beer out of this glass. 🤣 They're easy to clean and you can even put them in the dishwasher. The glass is high quality and very durable. I bought these for a housewarming present, but they were just too cute, so I had to keep them. 🤣 I'd definitely recommend these. They'll make a great addition to your glassware."
I’m not even sure how only one would be missing. There is no broken glass in the box so it’s not like one broke. It was as if someone took one out. But customer service was great and not only replaced the missing one but sent a whole new 10 pack. Very happy and love love love these cups!!
""
Love these glasses I will definitely be buying again!
"LOVE these drinking glasses. They are quite solid without being too heavy. I have another set similar to these but they are thinner and lighter - and much more fragile. I used to just use mason jars to drink from, but we all pick these over any other glasses we have in the house. My kids haven’t even chipped them yet after using multiple times a day for well over a month!"
"I just love these! I did read reviews that prices have gone up, but I was doing this as a one time purchase. They are super cute and I'm always getting compliments about them. They are sturdy and have survived hand washing or dishwasher several times."
"The cups came packed carefully and none showed up broken! I washed them in the dishwasher first, as anyone would. They did have a weird smell at first but once they came out, they were beautiful. They seem pretty sturdy but fragile at the top so I would use another cup to get ice to put it in. Nonetheless, I am happy with my purchase!"
"So impressed with the quality of these glasses. I had been looking for a set of glasses shaped like this for awhile but most only come in sets of 2 4 or 6, I was so happy when I found 10 at such a good price!"
"Needed a number of these for a vendor fair. Thick glass, no cracks/breaks. Can’t wait to order for more future Projects."
We use these with shatterproof glass straws. I use them for smoothies for my kids and I love to drink my iced coffee in these. Easy to clean and durable
Arrived perfect and have been using for about 2 months with no chips/breaks or cracks! Great cups
I loved these glasses the minute I saw them on Amazon. Once I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging as the glasses were in great condition and to my opinion they are really cute! Can’t wait to start using them right away! From touching them I can tell they are durable and not going to break from setting them down to hard or squeezing them.
We love these so far! They are pretty thin glass but so far they are holding up we will see how long they last!
The cups were packaged really good so everything came in without a scratch or cracks. Will definitely be ordering again
Libby glass cans have been back ordered for months so I got these and they’re very good value for the price. And the bamboo lids fit them as well!
These are definitely my go to drink glasses when I have company so cute
"These one of the best glasses I have ever bought my wife loves them, my friends love them as well. This will add a little flair to your get together or relaxing on your porch."
"Have had for a month or so now. Love them, the size and shape are cool."
I love these little boho modern glasses!! We will be ordering another set they are really great cups and easy to clean and dishwasher safe!
"Every glass arrived intact with no blemishes, and I am very pleased!! I bought these glasses to make projects with and sell. They seem like they are made of good quality thick glass. Worth the value of each glass."
Love these cute glasses. I use mine with glass straws for iced coffee.
These are thicker than you would think. Very nice and sturdy!!!
Right out of the box im pretty impressed. Came nicely packaged in box with lots of padding. Haven’t got to use them yet. But im excited so far
Super cute exactly as described and very durable feeling not thin glass
needed for etching of company logo and used as give aways
I love my glasses. They look great with my glass straws. Perfect for creating content.
These are perfect for glitter or vinyl or to use plain!
Cost was affordable. This was bought to make gifts for the girls! Cups are cute and beautiful when decorated. I was worried about packaging because it is glass but it came perfect and all glasses were in good shape.
These glasses are perfect! Very modern
They are just as described but be careful. They break real easy. I’ve already broken one :(
I like the size and the weight and of course the shape.
Everything arrived perfectly. Except for one of the glasses which seem to have air bubbles in the glass. When I opened the box it had a thank you card. I emailed that day and they responded super fast and took good care of a customer. Will be ordering more soon.
Thin glass but super cute
I got for my granddaughter for her birthday! She loved them for her 1st apartment!
Sturdy glass great for casual drinking
Great quality. Bigger and better than I expected. Would buy again!
These are super cute Glasses
""
Very weak cups. Two broke already
These are perfect! Such a good price and amazing quality. I love these glasses.
"I just love how every beverage looks good in this glasses. I think it is the perfect size for smoothies, lemonades and also my water with lemon."
"Awesome glass , for summer drinks"
"So cute, i love them so much. Just always looks good too"
Exactly as described and good quality. They were packaged well too and had no breaks or cracks.
Love these cups. Very stylish.
I absolutely adore them they are the perfect size 10 ounces and look great with the rest of my decor in the cabinets
These were the best purchases ever and such great quality ! Will definitely be purchasing from Le’raze again !!
Love for my business
Well packaged and they got here super fast! These glasses are super cute and I can't wait to make drinks with them!
I have been looking for these glasses but they were all somewhat expensive. Found these and ordered and they are really great quality! Dishwasher safe.
I love my new glasses!!! Just as described and packaged well!! Thanks for a great product ❤❤
I love these so much! They are perfect for everyday drinking and look great in my cabinet.
"Loved them! Definitely worth the price, will be ordering more for sure (:"
I loved them and was able to personalize them easily! ❤️
"These drinking glasses are great! They were just what I was looking for, they are just the right size and in my opinion great for any aesthetic."
I was absolutely happy with my purchase. Well packaged. Will be purchasing again.
So happy I bought these! None of them came broken like I read in some other reviews. No scratches or anything. Perfect!
These are perfect glasses! Delivered safely and packaged to not break! Can't wait to start decorating them
Great Quality
"Bought these corrugated paper cups for my wedding,to avoid the embarrassment of cups leaking,my boyfriend have made a test for them at extreme temperatures with 5 hours,wow,no leakage occurred,will update my review and order more and more for daily uses after the wedding."
"Always a loyal fan of paper cups for everyday using,I have no time to wash up my mug after drinking my coffee, so paper cups are an eco-friendly choice as they are 100% compostable,I can throw in the trash or recycling.But the first time to purchase the craft paper cups,these craft paper cups are also made from paper,just the novel experiences,easy to grasp and feel better on hands,then cup sleeves no longer needed,I think I have depended on them."
"I purchased these paper coffee cups for our congregations Christmas party to use for our hot chocolate bar. They are the perfect size to hold the hot chocolate mix from Nestle. They also kept the children from adding too much whipped cream and toppings , preventing waste and mess. Well insulated so no one burned their hand . They did arrive in stacks but were easily to pull apart and remade the stacks . Added bonus was the size of the cup fit under spigot of our hot water dispenser , so the dispenser could stay on table instead of hanging over edge of table."
"Received these paper coffee cups today,have to say,I really like the S-Ripple textured surface on these paper cups,bring me a better feeling on hands and i don't need a sleeves or double-cupping.Cups lids and stirrers are packed separately,I assembled one set and served my coffee,and I have put it in the microwave oven and heat for 2 minutes when the coffee got colder.And now,,okay,these paper cups have exceeded my thought."
"Best cups I’ve purchased in over a year.I’ve tried many. These are my favorites.I really like these kraft paper cups they are thick and strong and hold some seriously hot coffee,and thsy are easy to separate from each other.They are so durable, they don’t leak unless you let leftover coffee sit in the cup for 4 or so days. They also protect your hand from the temp of the piping hot beverage without need for sleeves.Great cups and lids and stirrers for the price!Excellent more than I expected."
"These cups are a good portion size for large crowds.Cups are very sturdy and keep drinks hot!it's like having a built-in sleeve on a hot cup. And I personally like the earthy look of Kraft. They are very durable and protect your hand from heat without a sleeve. Great size for guests in our office - not too much, but not a measly amount of coffee.Looks nice and does the job. ------"
"Package comes in a good condition,25*4 paper cups,50*2 cup lids and 100*1 stirrers,individually wrapped in five sleeves,then packed in one exquisite cardboard boxes.These paper cups are fully match the description and beyond what i was looking for.The bottom line is these corrugated paper cups won't have the problem those i bought before,that is stick together and difficult to pull apart."
"They are corrugated paper cups,nature-friendly,very thick and truly sturdy,i like to use them serve my coffee,and add some cream on.After each use,I remove the corrugated outer layer to use in paper crafting, and share it with other crafters,really did one cup many uses!"
"They are coffee cups with lids and stirrers,the lids fit perfectly won't leak.Thsy are12 oz paper cups,I love the color.The cups stick to each other,it's easy to pull to separate.Don't get too hot on the outside and keep my drinks in the right temperature.They will be my new go to cups and will reorder when were run out."
"Our favorite brand of ripple cup disappeared from Amazon, and, after using this brand, we are glad they did. I wanted cups that were easy to hold even when filled with hot coffee.This is a very sturdy cup and lid that can be used throughout the day. These cups met all my requirements! They were perfect! I will certainly order these cups again."
"They're really nice corrugated paper cups, and are well-packaged to arrive damage-free. We just bought them several days ago and those also arrived in perfect condition. No offensive paper taste, and pretty upscale,highly recommend."
"Firm touch, warm colors, exceptional rippled design with triple-walled insulation. No more issue of coffee spill.I highly recommend these disposable coffee cups to my friends.And plus, they are durable enough to be used more than once. I always use it a few times before throwing it away."
I ordered these cups and they are high quality paper cups!The heat insulation really works. I set my Keurig on the highest temperature setting and it is still comfortable to hold this cup.
"Bought these paper cups for my next weekend party,perfect color!They are not your typical disposable cup,the cups are made with high quality paper the lids are a heavy-duty plastic and I have been able to reuse the cups for many refills. The ridged texture does away with the need for a cozy. Such great design!"
"I loved these cups, I used them for coffee and hot drinks. My adult kids were fascinated with how comfortable they were to hold and attractive that they were. They are also sturdy and stable.I’m going to buy again and again, they don’t look like typical styrofoam."
"Best paper cups, corrugated paper protects from heat.These are excellent quality and arrived as promised,my clients are enjoying them and i will definitely buy again in near future."
"My wife and I were so surprised at the quality of these,we used these at a little outdoor get-together.These held up to multiple servings of water, ginger ale, juice...We even used one as an ice scoop in the cooler, and it had no problems digging up or holding onto ice."
"Great product It is paper so after using for a long period you need to toss.These are fabulous disposable cups! They are sturdy, easy to hold, great for hot coffee or other beverages and adorable to look at. I love them and they were a hit at our birthday celebration!"
"I love these cups! They are very sturdy, your hand doesn't get too hot, and they are easy to hold.People compliment me for these cups all the time.Perfect for our big get together to see the Christmas lights!"
"This company makes high quality paper coffee cups,this is the second purchase from them.I love these paper coffee cups,they are leakproof,attractive and you do not feel the heat of the beverage through the cup."
Good value
"The order was sent promptly.They just got a little warm for the little hands and thinner skinned hands,and very comfortable.Nice paper cups,can handle hot coffee without a sleeve. Paper cup is ribbed so doesn’t slip."
"Great size for guests in our office - not too much, but not a measly amount of coffee. They look so great and I love that they don't need a collar to be held. And the lids fit perfectly."
"Great packaging, heavy duty and strong cups for hot drinks,and really amazing and tight covers too."
"Great paper coffee cups with timely delivery.They're attractive, keep your coffee warm and easy to grab on the go.Great product. Sturdy construction."
"Purchased 12oz 100 Packs Insulated Kraft Ripple Wall Disposable To Go Paper Coffee Cups for my husband who used to bring one of our regular coffee mugs (that have no top) in the car with him for the drive to work because he doesn't like travel mugs. Besides our regular mugs being a spill hazard, the coffee also gets cold too fast - especially in winter. He loves having these cups to use instead! His coffee stays hot, his car stays cleaner and my ceramic mugs don't end up piled up on the passenger seat of the car. Win/Win. I like the biodegradable nature of the cups, just wish the lids were, too."
"I rated this 5 Star so it would be at the top of the reviews. The 1 star rating reviews all say the same thing. They stink like off gassing/chemical smell, especially the lids. It makes your coffee taste like plastic from China. They care so much about this product, the name isn't embossed anywhere on it. I suppose that limits culpability. Returning my 100 cup order and looking elsewhere. My guess is the materials aren't suited to hold items for human consumption.  I am really at a loss as to the number of great reviews. Bots??? Product is disgusting."
"They're cups, they hold hot liquids and do not leak. Amazon would not clear this from my list of products waiting for a review without a written review. I'm not sure why- but it is what it is. They're good cups, I bought them for work with company card to replenish coffee station before we had a large customer visit."
"The design of cups is really good and you can easily hold it, and has a good insulator and the lids is secure and sturdy as well. above all of that the quantity and the price is good. the only bad thing about the product is the straws, the two holes in the straw is very narrow, make hard to drink from it if the coffee is too thick(like froth cappuccino). rather than that it's all good"
"After researching quite a few different brands on here, I decided on this batch to serve my AirBnB guests. These cups, lids, and straws are PERFECT for my family and guests' needs! Everyone has been pleased with them, and they are fully compostable (earth-friendly products are VERY important to me). Highly recommend!"
"I order these to use at my salon and am very happy with them.I like them for that they are disposable and reusable,and they end up in the recycling bin."
"Cups are great, lids are great, only 1 out of package leaked. I'm cutting a star because of the packaging. The cups are in a plastic bag, and the straws are individually wrapped in cellophane. But they put really strong adhesive tape to hold the cup bag and straws together. When I tried to remove the tape from the straws, it destroyed the individual cellophane wrappers of half of the straes.  UPDATE ordered second time, and everthing was nicely packed. No tape on the straws, much improved. 5 stars now !!"
Decent quality at a decent cost. I took a chance with these. I got tired of the add on sleeves falling off or just hiding. These are corrugated in a way that allows you to hold a HOT cup of coffee. I got brave and found that these hold up to a second refill without coming apart at the seams. I would recommend these.
"My fault, not the sellers. I don’t care for the feel of the cups. The ripple doesn’t feel great when holding the cup but that doesn’t mean everyone wouldn’t like it. For some the ripples may be a non-issue. The product is advertised correctly."
This cup doesn't cause drip when used without the lid. It doesn't require any additional insulation from heat. The lids fit tightly but are not impossible to snap on. Will continue buying this for the office unless I can't find it any longer or if the price gets too high. All good.
"I love these coffee cups, easy to hold, no sleeve needed. Lids are very easy to put on. and they are very sturdy. These are my go-to coffee cups"
"What a excellent design. My wife and I gave them our shakedown test during our drive to Washington. Good grip, insulated hold and we loved the product."
"We use these cups daily ! They are great, sturdy, and do NOT leak as others so often do. Will certainly order again and highly recommend them."
A very quality set. Send these to deployed service members. They will love you for it ;)
Cost effective and super sturdy! Lids fit nice and snug. Really couldn’t be happier with this purchase. The corrugated cup makes it easy to hold and not feel so hot.
I re-order these for my office. I wish there was a bundle I can order without the plastic lids and straws. I highly recommend these. They’re sturdy and the perfect size for a cup of tea or coffee.
Only 1 cup has been used but I'm a hot chocolate drinker & my husband is a coffee drinker & he said the cup worked out perfectly!!!
"Heavy duty paper cups that don’t leak. My family is awful about bringing in and washing their reusable cups from the car in a timely matter, so we buy disposable cups to make grab and go coffee more convenient. These cups hold up well. I’ll pour my cup from home and am able to reuse the same cup over the course of my 12 hour shift without the cup leaking, where as with other paper cups I would have to use 2 in order for the cup to feel sturdy and to be assured it wouldn’t leak. This is my second purchase and I plan to continue to buy from this company."
Very nice cup with quality and looks as described on the site. They don't stick together and are easy to hold without burning your hand. I bough these for a bridal shower and will buy them again for a brunch wedding reception. I definitely recommend these cups.
LOVE these cups! very sturdy. love the color. and it's nice to have no need for a sleeve. the corrugated outer layer is easy to hold. VERY happy with these coffee cups. they are an excellent addition to my Café!
These cups are affordable and yet also sturdy and do a great job keeping my drinks warm
"Love this. I make coffee in the morning then take this with me when I drive to work no more going to Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee , I like the design and sturdiness"
We used these for a youth activity. I love that they're gender neutral and come with everything you need. We walked around looking at Christmas lights for an hour and there were no leaks or softening of the cup. Buy these for sure!!!!!!
Works perfectly for our fellowship meals
This 3 piece set is the best by far! The cups are very sturdy and the fact that they are rippled means no sleeve is needed. The lids fit very well with no leaks. The added bonus are the stir sticks. The price is very affordable and I will continue to order them in the future.
Unlike others hat I have purchased on Amazon these don't stick together and release easily. The lids work perfectly. Will purchase again.
"Put these in our office kitchen. They're very nice cups. Unlike others we've purchased, these lids fit snugly. Highly recommended."
Have used these coffee cups for the past couple of years. Insulated very well / better than a paper sleeve. Sturdy cups.
Sturdy leak proof cups. Great for hot liquids.
These cups are sturdy and the tops actually fit the cups. Great product!
"While the cups themselves are satisfactory, the lids are not. They do not fit properly onto the top of the cup. The lids tend to lift off causing spillage of hot coffee. I will not purchase again."
I bought these cups for my husband. He love it. He used that every days. Very nice coffee cups. Easy to hold and use.
"Cool looking paper cup😁 The cups feel good to hold, sturdy & you get lids and stirs. Will buy again!"
I bought these for our hot chocolate bar for our wedding. They were the prettiest disposable cups I could find. I was pleasantly surprised with how sturdy they were as well. No complaints!
excellent cups. Sturdy. No need for a sleeve to protect from heat. These are used for church and I will order again.
"Easy to hold, fits every cup holder in our cars. Excellent."
"VERY NICE CUPS. NO PROBLEMS WITH STICKING TOGETHER AT ALL, STURDY CUP & LIDS FIT NICELY"
These are so great. I bought them for a chocolate bar at a bridal open house. Everyone loved them! I’m so glad I had extras to put at my hot chocolate station in my kitchen.
Arrived on time. Packed well. As described. Thank you.
"Love the cups, great for my morning routine before work."
These were perfect and very well made!
These are the best value of any I've tried. The lids stay secure to the cup and don't leak.
The best 😍😍😍
Would buy it again.
"love these coffee cups and lids, I have been using disposable coffee cups on a daily basis ever since we moved 5 years ago, and I finally found a great product..very sturdy and lids fit tight..i have them sitting right next to our Nespresso machine and Keurig.."
Got these for a cheap alternative for my garden plants after they were to big for the peat peelot green house thing. I just cut holes in the bottom of the cups and it worked well
"We needed clear glasses for a dinner at church featuring grape juice. Glasses held just the right amount, sat well and no one spilled!"
"Works well,will buy again."
"Perfecto Para mi, pues quería crear helados de ese tamaño, y si cumplió mis expectativas, lo recomiendo si buscas un vaso que no sea tan Grande."
hold drink great
Son super buenos para lo que lo quieran comprar
This purchase was great if you need sturdy cups must buy!
This product was not what I was looking for I can’t imagine it holding 6 ounces of soda. They were super tiny I would think that this would be use for water cups for kids. I was a little bit embarrassed having this out for a party I was hosting for adults.
"I previously bought the 5 oz McKesson cups, which I liked very, very much, but they were unavailable when I went to re-purchase so I bought these. I was concerned, because a few reviewers said they were flimsy (or similar), but they're fine. Yes, you can squeeze them much easier than the McKesson, but they hold the liquid just fine, plus they also sit on a surface without toppling over. I don't see any problem with them, other than if you're used to a thicker/crisper plastic they may take a little getting used to -- that'd be the only negative I can see. I'm deducting a star for the easier squeeze, but, other than that, they're perfectly okay."
These cups are very narrow and hard to pull apart. We have to pull a few apart ahead of time so we are not struggling with them when a customer comes up. We have also had a few that leaked. We would not get them again.
"Decent quality, but DOESN'T fit inside of a bathroom cup dispenser like the ""Dixie"" ones. Pop right out of it."
As advertised. Perfect for bathroom use. Fast shipping.
Sturdy enough to reuse- colors are great !
"Big family, less time washing utensils."
This is just what I was looking for.
This is a product I can no longer find in my store. My family prefers the sturdiness of the plastic cup for the bathroom
"These cups are the perfect size cups! Great for a bedtime drink, or mouth wash!"
no good would not buy again
They were way smaller than expected but I should have looked at the dimensions but they were very flimsy and not real sturdy at all.
Bathroom
Too small for my cup holder. All other cups this size have fit. Not this one
"Perfect size for the bathroom. Durable, easy to hold and fit my cup holder in the bathroom. I normally use the paper cup. I’m like the plastic."
"Would not buy again,does not fit or work with. Dixie cup dispenser"
Some of the cups stuck together and only way to get them apart was to break some
Easy to hold
They're for every day. I spoil myself.
Bought these on Amazon because I couldn’t find them in the grocery store. Good value. Great small plastic cups
"Due to age and arthritis, glasses made of glass are heavy for me to manage. These plastic glasses are a godsend."
Great product
"Since the threat of Covid-19 this past Spring, I have been holed-up like a hermit in my house. This constant confinement has filled me with dread and anxiety and led me to add day-drinking in addition to the evening cocktails that were already part of my daily routine. The decision to buy these gorgeous blue tumblers has totally changed my outlook on life though...I still drink like a fish, however, now when I do, I feel very elegant. They look like expensive glass, so now I hold my pinky up proudly when I am carrying my rum & coke with me out to the curb to collect my mail."
"I was REALLY hoping to love these cups. I purchased them along with the matching divided plates and plastic bowls. My plan was that each of my kids would have a color they’d use and that would somehow simplify my life. While the kids all chose their own color, these cups were a major disappointment. First of all, thanks to the rim on the bottom of the cup, dishwasher water collects in every one of these cups (upside-down on top rack) and it’s a mess of gross water being dumped on the other clean dishes when the kids are unloading the dishwasher. Also I’ve had to throw 2 away (so far) that completely split down the side. Totally not worth the investment."
"I bought the Optix 14-ounce Plastic Tumblers | set of 8 in 4 Coastal Colors.  These are attractive Acrylic/Plastic tumblers and I love the colors. They are a nice size to hold too.  I recently have had to opt for plastic/unbreakable drinking and dining ware, due to a very clumsy husband who has been dropping and breaking a lot of my nice dining ware and glasses lately. We have hard, cold, ceramic tile floors throughout our house, so when something gets dropped it shatters all over the place. I have gotten very tired of having to clean up all this broken glass and ceramics, so I have had to switch over to unbreakables. I can say that so far, with my husband already dropping several of these pretty glasses, they do not shatter and break. BUT, they do crack, which renders them unusable. But, I am still happy that I do not have to clean up shards of sharp glass and then search for the tiny glass fragments. So, these Acrylic/plastic Tumblers have been well worth the price. At 1st I though that 8 Tumblers would be too many for just 2 people, but since Hubby has already cracked 2 of them in 2 weeks It now appears that 8 Tumblers is a good amount! As far as washing them, I do all our dishes by hand because I am trying to get away from using a dishwasher because of the energy waste and the toxic dishwashing soaps which I have become allergic to. These Tumblers wash well, but you need to towel-dry them to avoid spots and the water that ends up pooling on the bottoms of them if you just put them in your dish drainer.  All-in-all, I am very happy with these Tumblers and I will look into getting some other sizes of them as well."
"Decided to invest in these when our glass water glasses kept cracking, chipping, breaking, etc. I wish I had bought these sooner! The jewel tone and pattern makes them attractive and also easy to hold onto without dropping, and since they are plastic, I won't have to worry about them chipping or breaking like the glass ones do so easily. I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher because I'm not sure if the bottom rack will be too hot for the plastic, and they just barely fit. Highly recommend if you're tired of broken glass and want something pretty and practically unbreakable."
"Absolutely LOVE the colors of this set!! I bought this as a surprise for my mom, who always wants some new things but will never actually get herself the new thing(s) she wants. As soon as she saw it she was super stoked. She immediately hand washed her new cups and promptly threw the old ones out. It’s the little things that help. And after a few weeks, she still loves her new cups and is very happy for the change. (They have also helped relieve some of her arthritic pain as her last cups were too big for her hands. These are much more comfortable to use.)"
"I like everything about this 20 ounce tumbler set. The colors are gorgeous in jewel tone shades of blue, green, and purple, they wash well, are made very sturdy, and the diamond pattern on the outside of the tumbler gives it a little something extra in terms of visual appeal. The only tiny issue I had (that did not affect my rating) was a couple of the drinking edges at the top were slightly rough from the manufacturing process. I used my fingernail to take that off in a jiff, so quite an easily remedied issue. I highly recommend these tumblers."
"Great glasses! I read some reviews that said the edges are sharp but I've had them for over a month and haven't noticed that at all. Also there's a small space on the bottom of the glass like a barrier between the beverage and the table so they don't get condensation anywhere, even when I put a ton of ice on my water. I definitely recommend these"
"If I had known what I know now before unpacking two sets of these cups and washing them, I wouldn't have kept them. There is a huge lip on the underside of the cup (I'm talking about 1/4inch) that allows water to pool after running through the dishwasher. For some this may be no biggie... for my I find this really annoying. Not to mention the amount of water that accumulates from 16 cups holding 1/4inch of water. It's just one of this little things that will probably prevent me from ever reaching for these glasses in the cabinet and thinking ""greeeeaaattttt"" when the kids fill the dishwasher with them. Other than that, made it through the dishwasher with cracking or getting cloudy... however I wouldn't expect that for some time. Light in weight."
"Both sizes (14 and 16) of ""glasses"" work well for daily use. They stack nicely (initially, they suctioned pretty strongly - over time, they have relaxed on their ""grab"" :-)). They look nice, coastal color-wise. They are boat, kid, and butter-finger adult friendly.  One thing we didn't think to check is the lip on the bottom when having a dishwasher (top shelf) clean them. A ""lake"" of water remains when we empty the appliance. This isn't an issue for us when hand washing. We will keep them because we like them for all the other reasons. But, if there is a next time, we will pay closer attention (I guess we never go lipped ware before?! :D)."
"Looked for quite awhile before deciding on these. We like large cups for drinking when watching TV. Wanted to replace our regular sized cups, so we thought we'd give these a try before ordering the larger ones. I've read different reviews about dishwashers---some say they have issues and others do not. I did was one the other night in the dishwasher but did not dry it in it. I guess I will have to take a chance sometime and see if drying it in the dishwasher ruins it. I would definitely NOT put it on the bottom rack. Have not had any issues yet with the edges, but I use straws most of the time, so not a big issue for me. My husband really loves the colors and the feel of them. Very easy to hold."
"I am very happy with these glasses! I have good glass and crystal glasses that I love but prefer these for every day use. They are perfect for kids, as well as adults. They are sturdy and stable, attractive, dishwasher safe, and comfortable to use. I have the 14 oz ones. My only complaint is that the bottom has rims that hold quite a lot of water when putting through the dishwasher upside down. I wish the bottoms were perfectly flat. Otherwise, I love them and highly recommend them."
I bought these products for my mom for Christmas she was looking for a lightweight Acrylic glass drinking cup in order to use as a day-to-day cup. She has been using them for a little over a week now and has a very happy. The one thing she noted was that they are late enough for her to be able to drink with even with her weakness in her hand due to a stroke
"I have owned plastic type glasses int he past that promised to go through dishwashers but developed spider cracks very easily. I can tell you that these are not like those! My kids have already dropped these on a hardwood floor without any chip or cracks! Each glass has probably been through the dishwasher at least a dozen times so far and they are still like brand new! These work very well and I love how nice they look. I have no issues with the kids using them even knowing they will be dropped like kids do. Awesome product with a very nice style. My only problem is that the blue set looks so much like each other the kids get confused and drink out of each others. If you have kids, get more color variance.  I like so much I am thinking of ordering more. Great product!!!"
UPDATE: they sent me the replacement set of my order at no extra cost to me. Thank you so much for correcting rhe issue! Will be buying again! I love my cups! I ordered two sets of the cups on the left. I got one set and one of whatever those are on the right. My drop off returns location is too far away since I live on top of a mountain. Guess I'm stuck with them. Too bad because I LOVE the ones I actually ordered. The colors are lovely and they seem durable.
"I decided finally to invest in a set of sturdy plastic cup to fit my young kids and grandpa and not break and do far this product worked for those purposes and for my esthetics! They beautiful and comfortable to hold, I had a bit of an issue with stacking them and them getting stuck but support was immediately responsive and very helpful with practical advice and solution in case the advice wouldn’t work! Love it and ordering tall 20oz. as well!!"
Just got this set and while washing them I found one of them was cracked. Never used. Long crack in the side of the glass right out of the box.  Update: manufacture contacted me and offered to make this right. They are sending a replacement to me. Big thumbs up to them for reaching out to make this right.
"Decided to change our daily use drinking glasses. Found these beautiful light weight durable glasses in a group of 8. The color comes in 4 different shades of blue, the perfect summer/beach colors would be perfect as a housewarming gift. My teenage boys immediately loved them because they were just the right size (20 oz) and are easy to hold. They are also easy to clean, but I have only had them for 1 week so I am hoping they don't get the hard water stains to bottom of glass too easily. I definitely would recommend adding these beautiful glasses to your kitchen."
"Bought these awhile ago, and they still make me smile. Love the colors, the swirl pattern. How thick they are, and have stood up to being stacked, and run through dishwasher. No cloudiness, or scratching. They were a replacement for some cheap ones i got at another retailer, and the two just don't compare. And I noticed, if given the choice, my husband will pass over the cheaper ones, to reach for one of these, too. (Lol) They seemed spendy at the time, but I'd say they were worth it."
Perfect! We already had the shorter version of the cups and needed some more. I didn’t purchase our first shorter set for the house but I love them! These are exactly like those except they are 20 ounces. They wash great (dishwasher safe) and are sturdy for the kids to use. I received them packed well and on time.
I would have given 4.5 stars because the rim where you drink is a bit sharp. I suggest that the maker soften that somehow. Otherwise the glasses are beautiful and perfect for my coastal kitchen. In fact I'm going to order another set. I ordered the 20oz and even though another reviewer said they were cheap they absolutely are not. Great quality and perfect for a household with kids. The colors are really pretty. Will buy again.
"I read the reviews after these tumblers arrived. I checked the rims and they are not sharp, so I’m guessing the company fixed that flaw. I didn’t squeeze them to check their durability so they probably would crack if you dropped them or squeezed them, but honestly for the price and season(I couldn’t find tumbler anywhere so they must be a summer item in stores) they will do the job and are really pretty."
I was worried after seeing a few negative reviews but I thought it was a good price so I gave it a shot. It came quick but when it came the box it came in was really smashed and the tape was barely hanging on to keep enough of it closed so I was also worried about pulling it out of the box but when I did I was blown away. They were so beautiful and in perfect condition my mom saw me open it and she wanted some as well. I washed them in the dish washer and have had no issue at all. It’s been about a month now and the still sparkle like new.
"I love these! They’re light weight colorful and the colors, are all my favs! I like the rim. My preference is a thinner rim so these work for me. I only hand wash these so can’t comment on dishwasher usage. They are staying new looking so far and it’s been about a month. One got really sweaty the other night while I had lots of ice in the glass and was outside on a very humid night it did slip out if my hand but did not break."
"I was looking for some plastic drinking glasses that would hold a lot of liquid, stack nicely and look pretty. These are perfect for that!  If I had any complaints (and I really don't) it would be that the grey ones are much less pretty than the other three shades of blue, and I wish they'd chosen something less dreary.  I pop in the dishwasher to clean. The swirl design makes them easter to pull apart when grabbing one."
These are the best Plastic tumblers I ever bought. I have put them in the dishwater without any problems. They sparkle and will be beautiful for outside gatherings. I might even use these for year round for the grand kids.
"I wanted a nice quality acrylic glass for use at our beach house. This products scores very high in my book. The colors are great. The design is perfect, fits the hand well and I am VERY happy. I purchased a second set of 8 so I would have extras. The company is top-notch also. I had a questions and they responded very quickly."
"I've been using these for several months, and they haven't gotten discolored or spotted in the dishwasher. I like the colors. They go nice with my Pfalzgraf Yorktowne, and having different shades makes it easier to know whose glass is which."
"Although I thought these were going to be different pastel colors, the are all different shades of blue. It made me think of the many times that I had been on the ocean. They are very comfortable to hold and easy to clean. The price is quite reasonable, too."
Would have preferred glass but the colors are nice and they were a good price for the amount you get.fast shipping recommend if you have kids or are accident prone really good for camping
"As other have mentioned, the lips are a bit 'edgy'. Nothing a little fine sandpaper couldn't handle, just a little care and a minute or so they were perfect. And they are now our go to drinking glasses."
I was needing a new set of glasses for my kitchen but I didn’t want to spend a ton of money these are perfect for the price and wash nicely and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on them
"I bought these as a replacement for tumblers we've had for many years. We use them primarily when we're working or spending time outside. I especially like these since they can be washed in the dishwasher (having said that, I've only hand-washed them so far - old habit). The surface of the glasses is attractive along with offering enough surface variation that they are easy to hold."
"I actually use these for bathroom glasses. I display them on the ledge and when I need a clean glass, it's right there. In the meantime the other glasses give color to the bathroom esp. when the sun shines through the window. So, practical and pretty."
"Where have these tumblers been all my life? They are simply spectacular in every way! They hold cold liquid, hot liquid, and even ice cubes! HUUUUUUGE!!!! I don't know how I ever made it this far in life, then I ordered these tumblers. I'm now free to live a bucolic life of religious freedom with a cool beverage. Blessed."
We LOVE these cups. We bought two sets. They’re huge and the perfect size for water/tea/whatever you want to drink when you want a lot of it! They’re also very pretty! They’re pretty easy to grip too with the diamond-like pattern. We might even have to buy a third set!
Great cups pretty design and big and sturdy don't wash with a scratch sponge. Well I am amending this review after having these only about 6 months they have all cracked and broken! Don't buy!
"Great product. One was broken when they arrived, I called the company told them what happened and they replaced “8” of the glasses and had them here next day! Thank you so much"
I have been using these cups for over a month now and they have been great cups! Better than the Chinese made plastic cups I was using before. They’ve been trashed. These cups look great and are easy to clean. In some other reviews I see people talking about them having a sharp lip on the edges. That’s not been my experience. The edges of these cups have been normal. They aren’t sharp at all. Maybe the other people got a bad batch I’m guessing. But I really like these cups. I liked their quality so much I went back this companies amazon page and ordered some of their cereal bowls and they are really good quality plastic too! I will totally check out this companies wares if I need something like their products again!
"I’ve never been a big user of acrylic tumblers, but recently bought these after I bumped and broke the second glass in a month on the counter top. These are very nice! They’re appealing to look at and a breeze to clean."
We’ve been using these for months including daily runs through the dishwasher and they still look great. Other faux-glass tumblers look scratched and hazy with days. Not these. Still looking brand new. Durable and perfect for kids that are too old for kid cups and more attractive than traditional plastic cups. The colors coordinate well together and makes it easy to tell your glass apart. Stack well for storage. Highly recommended.
"We bought these to be used as our regular use glasses because of their vibrant colors. Also as they are not glass, the little one can use the glasses and feel like a grown up. There is no worry of shattering or injuries . Another positive is that it is dishwasher safe ."
"We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cups. They feel nice in your hand when holding them and are thick so you don't feel like the cups will bend or break. We like they are machine washable too. We would definitely recommend them if you are looking for nice, solid cups for your home!"
"This was great value and they look great. Nice cool tones of blue and green. I like that the bottom has a rim not flat bottom, less condensation. Has held up in dish washer well. Would buy again."
"Very nice glasses. Nice weight to them, not cheap and lightweight. Pretty colors. Each glass was in its own plastic bag and packaged well within the box so they are in perfect condition...not scratched or cracked! Super fast delivery. Highly recommend! Bought these for a gift, so buying some for me, now. :)"
I bought some Corelle dishes with blue flowers. These match all the blue colors perfectly. Nice size and weight and wash in dishwasher beautifully.
Love these glasses. Just unpacked them for summer use and the colors are true to what is shown. Great for some summertime drinks!!
After spending an hour cleaning up a glass we dropped on our kitchen tile I ordered these. They look great and I don’t have to worry about another round of cleaning up glass shards. I may order a second set soon. Love the mix of colors with my white plates.
The colors are beautiful and live up to what I saw in the picture when I purchased them. I had one small issue with one that I noticed was cracked when I opened the package. The company's customer service was great. They responded promptly and took care of the issue. I will make an effort to purchase from them again.
20 to 22oz. glasses are very hard to find so I was happy to find these. they are very light weight and very pretty. I ordered them in the costal (blue) color. I have some glass glasses this large but compared to these are very large and heavy. I never used to like plastic glasses but I really love these.
"Love these cups, they’re the perfect size and nice colors. Some other reviews mentioned the rim being sharp and while I can see what they’re talking about it’s really not sharp it’s just not curved at the lip. Not sure if I explained that right but these are great cups."
"Since glass can shatter and I'm clumsy and have a little kid, I wanted to get something that was shatter proof but had the appearance of a nice glass cup and not some generic boring plastic cup. I've had these for a few weeks and so far so good. They are beautiful and durable. I only hand wash them so I can't say how they will hold up in the dishwasher. Would highly recommend if you want drinkware that's shatterproof but isn't an eyesore."
These are beautifully made and hold up well in the dishwasher. You can just put them in tilted so water doesn't accumulate on the bottoms. Very happy with my purchase and love that they're made in America.
These glasses are very well made. Sturdy and easy to handle. They wash wonderfully on the top rack of the dishwasher. Highly recommend
I like the weight and colors and they are good for everyday glasses. I will get a lot of use out of them.
Arrived timely but one tall one was broken. Very nice looking but darker than photo showed for the beachy colors I thought they were supposed to be.
My boyfriend ownes a rental property & needed some more glasses like the ones we had in both units. These are beautiful & great quality. So far they are holding up great. Dishwasher safe! Love them!
"I loved these colors, although they don’t match my kitchen. I needed new glasses and these were perfect. They can be put in the dishwasher also…"
"These go with my Talavera dinnerware. Feel good in your hands, washes well in top rack of dishwasher."
They're very pretty. Colors match perfectly with my new Corelle Mountain Blossom dinnerware. I wanted to move from glass to something more lightweight as I'm getting older. The twisted design will make them easier to hold as well.
"Love the colors, the durability (sometimes they do chip or split: but my family is rough on things, hence plastic not glass), the utility, ease of cleaning, and they are made in the USA."
"Beautiful jewel tones. Perfect for front porch visits, by the pool and every day use. Much complimented on by guests."
"Needed some new daily glasses as my old ones had lost their shine over the years. These are lightweight, have a nice pattern that picks up the light, and the colors are beautiful. Not meant for hot beverages, but great for cold ones."
plastic glasses are very useful in my camper trailer. Road vibration/bumps no longer break my drinking water glasses
My only complaint is that water pools on the bottom of the tumbler after going through the dishwasher. Needs to be dried before putting them away.
"Very cute but strong plastic cups. They look fancy but don’t break if your child drops it on the floor. Great purchase! I love how the blue color scheme goes with my kitchen 😍😍😍. Plus, they are easy to clean."
These are perfect for Pool and Patios and other No Glass areas where glass should not be allowed.
Little water on top after in dish washer no big deal. Glasses feel good sturdy. Perfect for my grandchildren.
Tied of having to use the vacuum clean up glass. We solved the problem with these glasses very nice.
These glasses are great. The acrylic makes them unbreakable which I am bad at. The colors are really pretty and they are good size!
I love these glasses. They have the look and substantial feel of glass without the fear of breakage. The colors are beautiful. I wish they had a matching set of smaller glasses.
"It's amazing when you find something on Amazon that you can't live without. Who knew one could fall so deeply in love with a paper cup?! I bought them because I have to give my child doses of liquid medication twice a day, and I got so incredibly sick of washing cups for the teency amount of juice. I bought some other cups before, I think it was (leading brand) D*x*e but they were so flimsy. A slight squeeze or liquid sitting too long, they were an accident waiting to happen. These cups are so sturdy! Nobody will accidentally squeeze too hard and spill juice or medication everywhere. I find all sorts of uses for these! I use them as snack cups for nuts and dried fruit, a portion of baby carrots, a little treat when friends come over. I even use them to mix hot water with my cat's kibbles to make a gravy that she likes, and even if they are sitting with hot water for an hour, they do not get softer and break down! I have left water sitting in them for hours, and still they are sturdy when I go to toss them into the garbage. I absolutely love these!!!"
"If you're looking for a disposable cup for espresso drinks (minus the milk ... these are only 4 oz in size), this is a great alternative to try. If you live in a large family and concerned about sharing glasses for not only espresso, but perhaps mouthwash, etc., then these are a great disposable option for that as well.  I went with these in actuality because of a kitchen remodel where access to water for cleaning is restricted. If you are in a similar situation or buying supplies for a workspace, club, or religious organization where washing dishes isn't feasible, these are sturdy enough for espresso, and easy to discard, especially if hygiene in a setting with a large number of people is a concern."
These are fantastic for my hot cocoa shots.
These disposable paper cups are most convenient because they come in different sizes. They are perfect for using for different reasons. I would recommend these cups of different sizes for any household.
They’re cheap for that role and the office loves them. Good little Christmas gift for the work place.
Value and quality of the product.
they are good cups
Just right for what was needed
".... I made the mistake of ordering 5oz instead of 6oz. They work great, That it."
Came on time & work fabulously
Purchased for resin
Bought for school classroom and work great.
These cups are superior in quality. Bottoms don’t give out and leak.
Good cups
"As stated above, perfect product for what I needed."
Durable cups but too big for my Dixie size cup holder that I have in the bathroom.
Good value for that price
"These cups are great, the structure is amazing and the size is perfect for a shot of water. they do have a strong taste of paper, but I do think that I will continue to buy them."
Dixie cups come in 3 and 5 ounces. These cups do not fit any of their holders.
We keep them in our car and use them for water. Keeps expensive bottled water lasting a long time since nobody drinks from the bottle directly anymore…
"Amazingly sturdy for a paper cup. I can fill it with water and let it stand for hours and the cup holds up perfectly. Definitely a ""cup"" above!"
Quality disposable small cup at a decent price.
They are all stuck together so when you want to pull 1 out of the dispenser you get anywhere from 2-6.
"They are cups, you fill them with your choice of liquids and they don't leak. Tada!!!"
These are great! Quick and easy!
I can't understand how my crushed medicine dissolves better in these paper cups as opposed to glassware.
"They are Great for pour painting 🖼 😀 and for resin. They are sturdy, yet I can pinch the cup to get a more controlled pour.. And im sure they are great for coffee shots on the go also..lol"
"I like the firmness of the paper cup, which doesn't absorb water or wilt, or leak as the old cups did. The 4 oz size is ideal! I was using a 3 oz."
"Excellent product, can be use for many different kinds of things, mouthwashes, kids treats, and teacher's activities too."
"I’m reviewing three items I purchased separately hoping they would work together as a set. They did!! These are dishes for my daughter’s new apartment that has very little cabinet space so her stoneware set is just too bulky. So I decided to pick up some Corelleware since it is durable, compact and lightweight. I really thought I would find some items that might “work” together, but never imagined I’d find EXACTLY the right shades of blue to match everything. I guess the Household Goods Gods were smiling on me that day!  #1 - Corelle 18-Piece Service for 6, Chip Resistant, Ocean Blues Dinnerware Set, These round plates and bowls have a modern yet playful rows of dots along the edge in three shades of blue including navy, periwinkle and teal. The plate itself is bright white. The bowls have a navy blue rim. (In the Amazon pictures it looks black, but it truly does look blue in person.) I have used Corelle dishes for over 30 years and my only complaint is that they last FOREVER! LOL! I mean I love a good value, but I it’s hard to justify spending $$ on “new” dishes when the ones you have still look as good as the day you bought them. Nonetheless, after buying these for my daughter, I am eyeing a new set for myself.  #2 Sweese 6210 Porcelain Fluted Mugs - 14 Ounce for Coffee, Tea, Cocoa, Set of 6, Cold Assorted Colors . Since the Corelle set did not come with coffee mugs, I looked for some blue ceramic mugs and found these beauties! And, I’m thrilled to report that they complement the Ocean Blues dishes perfectly! (See photo). These are stoneware coffee mugs with an elegant fluted side. The insides is white - not cream or beige. The white is not as bright as the Corelle dishes, but close enough. The mugs have a good weight to them - but not heavy or clunky. Of course they are not Corelleware, and will probably not hold up forever, but they seem to be sturdy to withstand normal use. The color I ordered says “Assorted” and it arrived very well packaged. Each mug inside a bubble wrap back and in its own compartment in a sturdy cardboard box. As I said, the colors go very well with Ocean Blues dinnerware. Only one mug appears a bit more green than blue - but it’s still in the blue color family. Overall, I LOVE these mugs and at about $4.50 each, they were a bargain!  #3 Cafe 20-ounce Break-Resistant Plastic Restaurant-Style Beverage Tumblers | Set of 16 in 4 Coastal Colors. To round out my daughter’s dish set, she needed cups for cold drinks as well. She is in college so I wanted unbeakable glasses - but not Tupperware-like plastic. I searched for acrylic drinkware and found these gems. I hadn’t planned on getting 16 cups, but at $1 each, I could not pass these up. They are exactly as their description reads - very much like the glasses used by little mom & pop diners- slightly bumpy texture on the outside with smooth rims and insides. Of course the BEST thing about them for me, was that came in shades of blue that coordinate so well with both the Corelle Ocean Waves and the coffee mugs! Seriously, these dishes look like I bought them as a set together. I really lucked out with these glasses - each in a different shade of blue that just happens to match the Ocean Blues. (Actually, one of the colors is really more of a smoky charcoal. I plan to keep those for my husband to use out in his workshop so he doesn’t keep taking my glass glasses out there.) These cups hold 20 ounces but don’t look or feel huge. After you add 6-8 ices cubes, you can pour a whole 12 ounce can of soda in the cup without it getting to over-flow level."
"Update #2: five (5) months in, only three of the cups remain.  Update: revised down to one star. Less than a month in, we've got five (5) that are cracked. They caused the cups to leak, so we had to get rid of them.They're not getting unusual wear--after use they are put in the kitchen sink until the dishwasher gets loaded. We have $0.99 character tumblers from the big box stores (the ones that are often sold near the party supplies) that have lasted years. These are a complete disappointment. When the first one broke, we got rid of it--i figured it was a fluke. Now I wish I had kept it, because I would have returned the whole lot had I known they were this prone to breakage.  Bottom line: these are a fair value in drinkware. BUT, If you are looking for plastic tumblers like those you find at restaurants, these are *not* those tumblers. These are thinner, and they break more easily. The first one of ours broke only a week after getting them. They also have rough edges along the rim--I've had to de-burr all of them so as not to risk any cut lips."
"Would normally not review general use items, because i dont like coming on here to say ""they are cups. They hold liquid i drink. would recommend"". But felt the need to clear some things up after reading other reviews.  These are break RESISTANT, not break PROOF. Imagine dropping your water RESISTANT phone into the deep end of the ocean and complaining that it no longer works after retrieving it 2 days later. I bought these because of the viral videos of people blowing one cup to another. I am not very good, but can tell you that these cups have not broken from regular use. I had one crack on me after i threw it in my sink half filled with water and it hit the edge of the metal sink, but i have had more expensive cups also break after doing the same thing. So that is on me, not the cups.  PS. Restaurant style doesnt mean these are higher quality. They just look like the cups at most restaurants. Because they most likely are. Cheap and durable. Theyre cups, and they a good job of being that."
"-- EDIT 4/30/2021 -- Over 1 year since I made this review. Every single cup is perfect. No cracks, discoloring, leaks or chips. I would buy these cups tomorrow in a heartbeat. I have them in a constant rotation with each cup being used multiple times per week.  I'm lazy. I bought these cups because I was fed up of hand-washing my 4 cup set of glasses every time I used them. So I bought a load of unbreakable acrylic cups that I could just put in the dishwasher and run it when I was ready.  Pros. The cups are sturdy. No flex, they wash well in the dishwasher (top shelf) and they have a pattern to them so they are easier to grip when wet. They stack, so they don't take up a ton of room in the cupboard. They are pleasantly colored. They are USA made. No chemical smell, no staining (with constant use for iced-tea) They are light.  Cons. I can't think of any, not even a small one.  I heartily recommend these cups. I've had the set now for a couple of months with absolutely no issues. No scratches from use or stacking, no cracks or chips and I've dropped a couple of them on to hardwood floors. I've used these mainly for iced-tea but I've also poured hot liquid (almost boiling) with no deformation in the shape or any failures.  This is my honest opinion. I paid full-price for the tumblers and received no discount or free product for my review."
"First, I want to mention what was said in another review. These cups are break resistant, not break PROOF. If you abuse them, they will break.  I have ordered these cups three times in the past, from a different site. I was happy to see them on Amazon. I have 25 years of restaurant experience, and these are better than the quality most places get. I liked my set so much, I have given them as gifts to every kid moving into their first place. Will the survive a two story drop? No. Will they survive your buddy Kyle dropping his Monster and Vodka? As long as he doesn’t do it if the second floor balcony, yes. They are decent cups for a decent price. Perfect if you have kids or are starting out. Or clumsy like me and break glass. I like them enough, I came back years later for more. My original set only has two left. Kids and a few years ruin everything. But the two left are still in decent shape."
"I have some large & small nice glasses but my grown kids kept asking what happened to the old plastic cups? I was skeptical about these restaurant style cups, but they get used all the time. I finally removed my ""nice"" glasses to a different cupboard. I am pleased that they have held their bright color through the dishwasher cycles and hard water we have. They stack very nicely leaving extra room in my cupboards for more ""stuff."""
Was looking to replace old cracked mixed design plastic cups with something new. I had been to stores and always gave plastic cups a squeeze test. Simply hold it my hand and give a moderate squeeze. I broke a half dozen cups that should Never have been for sale to consumers (and I swear - it was a medium grip. I wasn't trying to crush the cups). I don't feel bad about it. Those cups were Trash. These cups I purchased passed the squeeze test and have held up for a few months now. Not one crack. I'm very happy with these cups. And I have a cupboard full of quality cups of the same design. Would definitely purchase again!
"I have not experienced what some of the negative reviews have said so far. These appear pretty sturdy to me and I've had no issue with extra plastic around the edges. I hadn't even seen those reviews until I came back to write my own...I probably wouldn't have bought them if I had. I honestly was just lured in by the low price for a whole set of 16 cups--the way my kids go through cups in a day can get ridiculous! So far ours have held up well, and are also easy to wash. Although I have small hands, we had lots of cups that I had difficulty cleaning the inside of. But my hand easily fits inside these for washing. The colors looked really pretty online ,and coordinated with some other dishes I was buying at the same time--I was not disappointed upon seeing them in person. I don't have a ton of vertical space between shelves in my cupboards, but I can easily store these in stacks of four, which really helps save space.  I wonder if perhaps the company saw some of the negative reviews and decided to work on improving their product since then? Because I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"Bought these when I realized I didn’t have any non-glass glasses and a house full of teenage boys! 🤦‍♀️  Ordered these bc it reminded me of my childhood family Italian restaurant growing up. They’ve been perfect!  Different colors mean the boys don’t mix up their glasses. Dishwasher safe. Dropped and dropped again without breaking or cracking. LOTS of cups means don’t have to wash glasses every 5 seconds.  Highly recommend! Cheap, sturdy, practical."
I like that you can give these glasses five stars for being easy to hold. But there’s no way that you would ever get the fact that I have giant hands from that five star review. So let me lay this out straight for you.  Yes they are comfortable to hold. But for my giant hands I could say the same things about a damn paint can. I would give the paint can five stars as well.  So if you like the cups that they have at the diner as much as I do then you should buy these. But if you have ridiculously tiny hands you might want to head to the dine and try em out first. Cause I can not verify that the will be completely comfortable for you to hold.
I bought these because glass dust doesn’t work anymore I have a difficulty holding things but I have to drop these onto the tile floor‘s cement floors carpeted floors and it always bounces back I have not been able to break one yet but I will keep trying you’ll have a lot of success with these clothes they look good almost like glass when you see them in someone’s hand update September 2021 I moved to a new house I put these glasses into the dishwasher on the bottom rack and they come out looking like they should be used with the elephant man they were all distorted and melted I went back and re-read the description and it says top dishwasher rack which I’m sure is better because it’s less hot up there or less close to the heating element. Before I destroy them they were excellent glasses and enjoyed them very much I have a few left but it just won’t work in the current dishwasher I have so be careful but you’ll like them take care I hope this helps Keith
"I was waiting a little bit to write this review because some people were complaining aboiut various things. I wanted to see how the tumblers held up. You know: a lot of people whine online. I've had them for about a month now. I use them as water glasses every night. I alternate glasses since there are sixteen of them, and I put them in the dishwasher. These are great. Consider, they're roughly $1 a glass, but I find them sturdy, easy to hold, and they look great. Highly recommended."
"These are a huge throwback to those times when Pizza Hut used something very similar during the 80's and 90's to serve their frosty cold beverages. I bought these cups because of the nostalgia, rather as a parent who knows these cups can withstand a toddler's wrath and destructiveness. I don't need to worry about glass breaking everywhere and having to constantly replace them. Best of all, I can use these cups to actually train our child on how not to spill a beverage without worrying that this cup will be a victim to a tantrum. I have seen these cups be thrown against concrete, windows, furniture and take quite a beating without taking a nic or scratch. They look great, they feel amazing in the hand, they function well with any type of cold to lukewarm beverage and they last long.  I highly recommend these cups!"
"Very very fast shipping only 2 days! I read negative reviews about sharp edges around the mouth piece. Out of the 16 that I got only 3 were like that but just a few sharp edges but not the whole mouth piece. Just needs a little shave down NO BIGGIE! For the price its PERFECT! I haven't used these cups yet but I know for fact these are sturdy these are the same exact cups we use at my job but clear and it gets a lot of beating out of it with ice and refills over and over again. If I drop a cup yes it breaks sometimes but in my home I have never dropped my drinking cup. I love the colors beautiful. I got a set of each color. This is perfect for the 3 adults in my home, If you have young kids this may not work for you unless they are careful with things . I will test 1 cup out as of today and write back with update. The rest is for Christmas to myself along with new cookware and dishware. I can't wait! Hope this review has helped others to make their decisions...  Edit: 2 months later it's still holding up glad I got these very light and love the colors great addition to my set."
"I bought these for my teenagers to use in their rec area, and they are holding up very well to my boys. I usually don't like plastic drinkware, but the quality of these is very good. I've put them in the dishwasher numerous times; they wash well. Good product. Bought a second set for my older daughter who kindly takes the boys on weekends. It was the least I could do with her ceramic tile floors and formerly nice glassware. She is pleased as well."
"We love these cups! I have a big family, my husband, 5 kids, myself and my Dad constantly walks in and out of my kitchen with food or drinks (he lives right across the hall). Let’s not forget to mention the neighbors, godparents, sister, brother-in-law and their 5 kids! Phew...I’m tired just writing about it. Anyway, I definitely needed a generous amount of cups and BREAK-RESISTANT, very important when there’s little ones running around. The colors are gorgeous, girly colors, nice macho colors, and the best part of all they bring back happy memories of diners we’ve frequented in the past. I’m very happy with my purchase! I do admit...I count them at the end of the day just to make sure all are present and accounted for...sometimes one goes A-wall and ends up in my Dad’s house."
Very happy with this purchase.At my age (67) my hands tend to be a little wonky and my heavy glassware is heavy and slippery when wet😊.packed them away when I found these because plastic grocery store glasse.s are fine for barbecues but it’s nice to have an everyday alternative.wish I had taken a picture of the packaging because it was first rate.perfectly and cleanly packed snug in a new box.stacked nicely and individually. wrapped
"So far, so good, I have a family of 4. We were having issues with finding full glasses of milk all over the house with nobody taking the blame. I suspected it was my 9 year old but I didn't have proof. Finally I had enough of the waste and having cups strung all over the house. I ordered these cups and assigned everyone a color. I haven't had any issues since. Everyone really enjoys having their own glasses. The cups are well made, dishwasher safe and shatter-proof. What more could you ask for? I love my glasses. I put half of them in storage and only use 8. This is definitely the best $16.99 I have ever spent."
"Straight out the box, I looked them over because of other reviews. None were broken or cracked. I washed them, didn't see any plastic pieces. They seem just as sturdy as some older cups like this we have, which is why I ordered these. The colors are just as pictured. I plan on ordering another set. If anything chnages, I will update my review but these seem perfect to me."
"Exactly what I was looking for!! I wanted the cups that you get in family owned pizza shops so that when my teens have friends over, they can take to the dock or pool and I not fuse at them! I also wanted something that matches our beach decor and the colors fit perfectly. Good quality from just unpacking them, so hopefully they last throughout the use of 3 teens and friends. UPDATE: after a year, I ordered another set of these. I loved them so much that I downsized our actual glasses and replaced with these. They take a beating, do not stain with colored liquids, do not lose color or fade with use in the dishwasher and are easy to stack."
"Just received tumblers today 11/4/21. The colors are pretty and they are 20 ounces. I have children in my home often, and the breakage of glasses has been far too many even though they are teen and pre-teen. So I decided to invest in some inexpensive, colorful tumbers. They feel pretty sturdy and easy to hold. I am pleased with this purchase!!"
"They remind me of cups I see at restaurants. I have teenagers & their friends over frequently, they seem pretty indestructible. I like that they are dishwasher safe. We have a pool so they are perfect for the kids to take outside with them."
For the price you get a lot. Needed to replace almost every piece of drinkware in my cabinet and these did the trick. They’re perfect for everyday use and the perfect shape for better holding. They’re pretty much restaurant quality and confirmed dishwasher safe. Would buy again and the colors are nice.
"This is exactly what I was looking for!! I am so pleased with these cups. Now everyone in my family gets a color coded cup, so I don't have to wash a bajillion cups! (I have to handwash, because we don't have a dishwasher.) Oh speaking of, for those of you who DO have a dishwasher, maybe this is my error for not reading further, but the cups don't say on the bottom ""dishwasher safe"" on them, I noticed. If you DO plan on dishwashing them, I would maybe read a little better than I did and see if they really are dishwasher safe. I don't see why they would NOT be, they seem like restaurant quality, but I just happen to notice the lacking of that little phrase. Anyways, other than that, which is not a deal breaker for hand-washing ole me, I LOVE THEM!"
I got these for my children that either leave cups in their room for so long I just throw them away 🤢 or loose completely somehow. Cheaper than glass so I won't be as upset having to replace so much. More durable and affordable than single use plastic. Been through several dishwasher cycles in the top rack already. Still like new!
"I can't see any prospect of being injured by these drinking ""glasses,"" even though a few may have the tiniest of burrs on the lip. I wouldn't have even looked for this imperfection, except that I read a few reviews that did mention that. All of my cups arrived intact. It's an ideal number of stackable cups in an ideal size and I like the colors. These will not easily get broken at my house. We've been using them for almost 3 weeks and so far so good."
"These are what you would see at a restaurant or food service cafeteria. My only complaint is that I wish they were all one color instead of four blues, however I did not want red or brown and those were the only single colors available when I bought these."
Are they restaurant quality? No they are not. But for $20 you get a lot of cups and they don’t break when my 1 and 3 year drop them on the floor. Wash well in the dishwasher we only put them on the top rack hoping they will last longer that way. For the money you can’t beat em. The colors look great. We had them for a month and they are still functioning daily!
"I was hesitant to purchase these cups as I saw some reviews regarding the tops being rough. We purchased the 20 oz cups in the 16 cup set. The colors are pretty, the cups hold up great in the dishwasher and I haven't found a single one where the rim was not smooth. One of my favorite purchases because I use them everyday and for some reason they make me happy!"
Even though I was missing one cup and one was also broken this was well worth the money. I didn't contact anyone as I've been too busy with a newborn. 2 glasses are the least of my worries. The box came sealed not damaged. Thought it was weird a green one was missing then 2 days later noticed a huge crack in a blue one. But it's now almost two months later everyone has been through the dishwasher multiple times and man handled by an 11 year old as well as 35 year old and survived family holiday parties all while accidentally being dropped on the ground. I would say these are pretty durable
I bought these specifically because my kids tend to be rough with cups. They take them outside and drop them and in general just rough them up. These cups are fantastic! They take the abuse the kids dish out and then some. Dishwasher safe and easy to clean. The vivid colors look nice in the kitchen as well. I highly recommend if you’ve got rough little ones or teenagers who like to drag cups around everywhere!
"The wife and I were at Hooters and she remarked how much she liked their beverage tumblers. Searched and found these on Amazon, they are 2 ounces smaller than Hooters tumblers but that is negligible. I like the coastal colors and also that these are BPA free and dishwasher safe. Made in the USA is a bonus! Fast shipping and a good price."
"For the price they are great. They are better than I was expecting. Would they break if you dropped one on a cement/hard floor? Maybe. They'd probably crack at least, but I think a lot of plastic cups would too. The colors are the same as shown. Trying to wean the kids off water bottles and needed more plastic cups. Good size and if I needed more, I would not hesitate to buy more of these. So far none have broken and I have 4 older boys using them."
"I bought these cups for a house warming party. They are nice, hard plastic, not as thick as restaurant cups but perfect for parties. I do think they could possibly crack if dropped on a hard surface. All in all a very nice cup, pretty jewel colors, I really like them! Now I need to have another party to get more use of them!"
"We bought these because glass tumblers were not a good idea around our household--things get broken. This set offers a good variety of colors and there are plenty to ensure that everyone in our home, visitors or not, have a matching tumbler. They go through the dishwasher just fine, but they are not as thick as normal restaurant quality tumblers. They work for our needs."
I have a rental with 2 outdoor spaces and people kept breaking glasses. I wanted to eliminate glassware while maintaining a high level of quality in the tumblers. This does that and the variable colors make it so that each of my max 4 guests gets a different color! Exactly what I wanted for my rental house.
"I love these glasses! They're bright and remind me of the glasses some of my friends had when I was young. They're sturdy and wash well on the top shelf of the dishwasher. It's literally impossible to find these in 4-6-ounce size, and in bright colors. It seems everyone who carries them are constantly out-of-stock. I'll keep looking though."
"Great colors, wonderful for family, and overall good purchase. They are pretty sturdy but kind thin. We've had 2 break since we bought them but still they hold out with the abuse we put them through. I'm truly surprised they have made it this far without more casualties."
"First of all, I had been looking for affordable restaurant quality cups for months before finding this on the list of Prime Days deals. These cups are great, they make everything taste much better than standard plastic-ware and glass-ware cups. Since these cups do not alter the taste of water like my previous cups, I have been drinking a lot more water. It also doesn't alter the taste of soda, like my glasses do, so I drink just about anything that isn't a hot drink out of these. Everyone who comes over uses these cups instead of the old ones because they enjoy them just as much as I do. These are great quality cups and I am glad I bought them. I am never going back to any other kind of cup again!"
"Outstanding product! Pretty colors, wash up well and if dropped no cracking or shattering. Really a great option for families that use a lot of drinking glasses. I have been buying plastic ware glasses at stores and they don’t last or scratch up. These are sturdy, have a tiny texture that makes them nice to handle. Keeps drinks good and cold for a long time. A retro restaurant feel and look to them, glad I purchased these. All my old ugly glasses and plastic glasses are replaced by these. Very pleased that I have these as everyday glasses."
"The colors are great. My kids dropped their cups often enough, they don't crack. I've washed them in the washing machine at least 6 times now and they don't crack, discolor, scratch, or look any different than before I put them in. These cups do hold 16oz to the brim with no more room than that, in case that's important to anyone.  Yes, I would recommend these cups."
They shipped really fast I love these cups my kids loved these cups I've been dealing with problems with my children not wanting to drink from a regular glass and these have not been an issue in fact the bag for these so problem solved they fit in the cupboard very nicely they stack unlike regular glass glasses they don't break like a glass glass and they're pretty good size as well as weight so it doesn't tip over
I bought these to replace a smaller version of clear cups that I bought 20 years ago. These are very similar and I liked the old cups. These go through the dishwasher and look fine afterwards. I like the 20 ounce size too. The rough pattern on the sides make them easy to hold even when wet.
"I used these for several weeks - daily. We washed them in the dishwasher - top rack AND bottom rack. The color remains vibrant and the plastic appears the same as the day we unpacked them. Terrific quality for a household staple for people who practically live outdoors in Texas. Life with a pool demands plastic glasses instead of disposable paper, plastic or cardboard products."
"These are really sturdy and light weight. You get a lot of them and they are nicely priced to replace when the kids ""lose"" them. You get a lot with the order and it is just a really good deal."
* update! I contacted the seller and they sent me a whole new set. I would have been happy with just the one cup they definatly went above and beyond* I was so excited to finally throw away all those crappy little kid cups. I was incredibly disappointed to find one cup has a hole it it. It is the wildest thing
"Got these to replace my son's kid cups, so he could keep using plastic but they were bigger. We all ended up using them because they are so convenient. I have washed them in the dishwasher for months and they have held up very well. Highly recommend!"
"I like the colors, the style and the fact that these tumblers have a flat bottom. After dishwasher is complete there is no residual water on the bottom of the tumbler making it easy to just put them away. I can also add a lot of ice cubes and a 12oz coke without any problems. I bought the 16 pack and feel I'm set for a long time."
"These cups are great! It was hard finding the right size I wanted. This seller did a great job describing how many ounces these cups hold. These make great Ice Tea cups, soda too! Will be using this seller again in the near future! Also a very fast shipper as well!"
these dont break easily even when dropped on tile or wood floors. fit in the top of my dishwasher. this size is much sturdier than the 32 oz ones and they dont fit in the top of the dishwasher FYI! i ended up getting 2 sets of this size and we use them all the time now.
"Just what I was looking for. Sturdy, attractive, and inexpensive. Perfect for the back porch in summer without worry of leaving out the best glassware.  Others have mentioned the slightly ""sharp"" edges and mold mark on the bottom, but I think they've significantly exaggerated them. I don't see any risk of injury here, it's just not as smooth as some might like. If it bothered me, I'd just take a bit of fine-grit sandpaper to the edges, but nobody in my family has complained so I'm content to use them as they are."
I purchased these because my four kids kept dropping and shattering my glass cups. I was tired of buying glasses all the time. These hold up and clean so well! They look nice too :) I got the blue cups. Definitely recommend.
"Just what I was looking for. Cheap, cute, light-weight, and kids can’t break them. We were ready to upgrade from kid cups but not quite ready for glass and these were perfect!"
I don't know what people are looking for in a plastic cup(referring to other reviews on these) but these are EXACTLY as stated. They are like the old school red ones from pizza hut. I kept the red ones for years but they have slowly disappeared so I bought these to replace. These are identical. Except prettier colors. Plastic cups if dropped will break people. Jeesh.
If you prefer the restaurant cups you get when you are out these are the cups for you. They are very sturdy and easy to clean. The size is perfect. Not to big and not to little. I chose the colored glasses to help hide some of the scratches you will get over time. The color was consistent and I couldn't find and imperfections. Nice quality and packaging was great.
"I read like them, except for the ridges inside on the bottom that could be hard to clean if something dried on it, like milk or something. Why is that even there? And it sometimes hurt my fingers to wash them... wish they were just smooth."
I ordered these glasses because I have arthritis in my hand and cannot use heavy glasses. These are very lightweight and they are durable too. I am very happy with my purchase!
Kids broke half out glassware being kids. Got these as a safer alternative. They look like something from a local restaurant and can confirm they survive a fall to tile floor. Very durable and aren't embarrassing if you have company over.
"These are great tumblers and last for years. Nice size and don't tip easy. I have 4 clumsy children and tile floors, and my last set lasted for 3 years before needing to replace with these. Was excited to see they had different colors to choose from this time around, love the coastal colors! Hoping these last us another 3+ years ~"
"6 kids at home ranging from 18 months - 15 yrs, plus 4 more grown that bring their kids, we're all about durable products! Love that I was able to find these great colors! Awesome pricing too!"
Sturdy cups nice to drink from held up well in top rack of dishwasher but one got ever so slightly warped in the dry cycle when on the bottom rack. They’re a good size to hold as well and easily fit a whole can of soda.
This is actually my second set because my daughter saw the 1st set & fell in love. I had to lie & say I get them for free so she'll take them & I bought me some more & thinking about buying more..
"There is nothing wrong with these tumblers...they are exactly as described. However, every single tumbler is individually wrapped in a plastic bag, nestled in the other cups. While I understand it was probably 'necessary' to protect the finish on each cup, in my cupboard they are stacked directly on each other. It just seems like excessive packaging."
"Love these so much. With a busy household these are perfect. I don't worry about them breaking if they get turned over, they can be stacked, and are attractive to look at."
"These are restaurant style plastic cups, so durable and a good size. They've held up fine in the dishwasher. We have a restaurant style cup dispenser in our kitchen for which I bought these, and it's working well. The colors are nice too."
"I shared with my grown kids and had to laugh when they brought them out for a firepit cookout last nite. Bragging about them to all their friends saying remember these red ones from Alfies pizza and the green from some other fav hangout when they were younger. (insert snort here as they are all very early 20's) Anyway point is they love them as do I. Durable, evidently nostalgic, great colors and we dont worry about the little ones 2 and 4yr breaking them and getting hurt."
With a family of four I was finding by the end of the day there were 30 different cups in the sink. I bought these cups and assigned every one their own color and they were responsible for using their own color and washing when done...and that problem was solved. I have had to catch myself running up stairs to collect MY red cups because they were no more and making me live my own rule. The kids love it!
These r great needed cups for sure. They always disappear. So these are the perfect ones to get. Aren’t expensive plastic and colorful so if you end up missing one cuz someone takes it home well it’s not that big of a deal.
My boys like to take cups from the house & we needed something sturdy that was inexpensive & still good quality. These are prefect for on the go beverages!
"Bought these out of nostalgia remembering eating at Pizza Hut in the 80s (they had red ones). So glad I did! These are fantastic and as my husband likes to point out, you don't need to use a coaster. The outside stays dry. Love the coastal colors!"
I was in search of a company that made quality cups and that would be able to properly print my logo on the cups. THEY DID IT! I will continue to use them for my orders in the future!
Beautify done ..so surprised great vustomer service
"This Company produced a quality cup, not flimsy, in short order!"
Seriously you couldn’t make the font larger!!! Thanks for nothing. Can barely read what is on the cup👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
"Product was exactly as advertised, shipped quickly and they even reached out with a suggestion to make the logo look better, it was perfect. Highly recommend this product."
Only got half the order and have not been contacted to fulfill the rest of the order.
Great looking custom cups!! Arrived ahead of schedule and our party guests LOVED!
"Wasn’t pleased with the picture on my cups, they were more of like scetch drawing of my kids ..."
They are just as they were described on the website. Plus they got here pretty quick. Good job and thank you
I absolutely love my cups! Will definitely order again !
Love these
Satisfied customer
Great sturdy cups!
Really nice work good quality
Great Product. Would buy more
Cups are great been through the dishwasher a few times and still the print is on. I would suggest making sure you pick your colors wisely I chose orange and the font is not as large as I would have liked I'm going to order them again with bigger font. Great gift!
They are great I hadn’t got my product the first time but they made sure i got it and the product is great i just wish they had more color options for photos but i like product a lot👍
I loved them for my marketing I will be purchasing them again.
"These cups are great!! We got them for my granddaughter's sweet sixteen for the gift bags. She was adamant the text be in gold. I was concerned it would not stand out well on white but it looks perfect. Her party isn't for a few months so we have been using a few of them and they stand up to abuse. We put them in the dishwasher daily (top shelf) and there is no damage to the text and the cups still look like new. For the price I couldn't be happier, plus they came in record time for a product that was customized. Bravo, you have me for a lifetime customer. Highly reccommend!!"
Nice comfortable glasses at a good price.
Worth the money... very fast delivery
"They work fine, no complaints so far."
Not so easy to hold Have to double up on the cups because coffee is too hot.
The first sleeve of cups were difficult to get the lid on but now the second sleeve is worse! A disposable cup without a sealing lid is useless.
I bought these cups because I didn't want to spend the extra money on rippled coffee cups. Because of all the good reviews I thought these would be okay with hot coffee in them because I only carry my hot coffee from the kitchen to my truck and then drink it about 45 minutes later. Caution! You cannot carry hot coffee in this cup without a sleeve! (Why would you buy a coffee cup that needs a sleeve anyways?) These are getting returned!!!!!
"Lids don’t fit on the cup right. Will fall off if you grab it wrong, spilled many cups of coffee because of bad lids. Cup gets very hot need to double up on cups just to use"
"These are quite attractive coffee / hot beverage cups. A couple of different designs. They have nice fitting lids. One thing to note is that they do get quite hot, so you will either need to supply your own sleeves… Are certainly additional napkins.  These cups are made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of thirty-three bucks, which equates to thirty-three cents each, they are super crazy expensive for what they are, which is Chinese paper."
"Nice disposable cups. The walls are thick enough but if your drink is super hot, will need to double or use sleeve."
""
The sample cups and lids sent for review work just fine. You do have to press down the lid hard enough to lock it in place. Otherwise it won't stay on. The cup is sturdy and does a good job of insulating. It has a nice looking design. No real issues with it. 4 stars.
Perfect for everyday coffee or tea drinker. You get a good amount of cups and lids. I will order more when I use all of these up.
Lids fit great and can close. Used a cup all day with 3 refills while working around the house and no issues.
"Works perfect, fantastic product! Recommended!"
Cups are sturdy as well as the lids. Just what we needed!
Fast shipping and definitely holds coffee longer than most cups I’ve used in the past
Good cups but pricey
Funcionan muy bien.
good
"It’s our everyday use, especially when Grandchildren visit."
"The wife likes them…. Happy wife, happy life.."
Cus stick together Will not buy again
"I always order these cups and they are great, sturdy and sanitary for this day and age. I order for myself and daughters, and we all love them. You can't go wrong for this price!"
Perfect for using as taste testers!!
They're not as sturdy and they don't hold quite as much liquid as the 9 oz. cups I had previously.
It's good for ever day use.
Exactly what I was looking for. I have a 15 and 17 year old and they have friends here all the time. It saves me such a hassle.
Just opened the cups and they are dirty! The plastic packaging was not penetrated so I am not sure what could it be. Looks like vomit to me. I am so upset!!!
"I bought these for a graduation party last summer. They worked well for what I needed them for. They were surprisingly durable for a plastic cup, and didn't smash easily with little hands gripping them. The price was right, and I wouldn't have an issue purchasing the Amazon brand of plastic cups in the future (in fact, I have two and a half more years until another graduation and I probably WILL do just that!)"
Few of the cups arrived stuck together and I ended up breaking 4 cups from the first sleeve I opened. Not the same quality as the ones from Costco...you get the same amount of better quality cups for $7 less at Costco. Will not be buying again.
I typically buy Solo cups but decided to give these a try and I'm glad I did. Such a good value and I cannot tell any difference between these and the Solo.
I cannot contain my excitement about these little containers. The liquid I wished to contain remained contained in this container.
"**I purchased the disposable red plastic cups, not the translucent ones. My review is intended for the red cups. This is the product link on my purchase, so if it's the exact same cup, my review holds. Otherwise, this may have been an issue with the product getting switched after I reviewed it.**  Nice, sturdy cups. Had no issues."
"So long Solo! Hello Amazon! I go through many cups per year. It becomes quite expensive. Not no more! These cups blow the Solo cups out of the water! Better cup, better durability and, best of all, better price! Thanks Amazon! Keep up the good work!"
"Looking to capitalize on your jello-shot moxie? The are perfect..cups are Saturday, lids fit well and you can make 16 shots out of one pack of jello...so this is an excellent value! Don’t wait until you have the idea to make shots for the weekend on a Thursday...order them NOW!"
"Great job holding beverages. The beat at being red and, somewhat cylindrical- when looking for something to hold a beverage which can later be recycled this is the item for you! Well done!"
Highly recommend as they are way cheaper then any store. And they do as they are intended
"I love these cups. I use them for every day in my house. We also was and reuse sometimes. I am glad Amazon brought them back. I believe they are a little less thick, but they are still a great cup."
We order these cups all the time from our grocery store. This quantity and price made it cost effective to order from Amazon. We are glad to have this option.
Nice size and very sturdy. Nice being able to buy the large quantity.
"Solid quality. No different than the big named brands. Good for everyday use, parties and beer pong. Occasionally you might find something on sale in store slightly cheaper but that's rare. Good deal overall"
Bought these Christmas party. Great quality
Love them 3rd time buying these worth the money
Looks Good and a Great price. Very Durable.
Who doesn't love the fact that you can let your kids refresh thereselves and not leave you a sink full of glasses. So glad I found these in bulk very sturdy and very helpful. Especially for my big family. Highly recommended
In The second order the cups seemed cheaper and really stick together and I think slightly smaller. Not near as nice!!
Big Red cups. The most versatile cup around. We have hundreds of these we use for everything from drinking to mixing paint.
Comes in master box to protect during shipping. Large 16oz cups. Durable. Comparable to other more expensive brands.
"I'm using these cups for seedlings when they come out of the starter trays. Fairly easy to cut a drain vent in the bottom. They have been handled a lot, no damage to cups. I'll buy again"
Durability
Handy to have around
""
Well worth the money for the amount of cups. Not flimsy.
Good size for growns ups and kids.
Please tell me these are biodegradable. You can use for refills if you keep track of your cup lol
There's nothing I dislike about these cups I use them all the time but I never bought them in bulk before and for the price this was a good deal
"Very good price I read all reviews and they are plastic cups that serve the purpose created for. I have 3 kids so I buy all my plastic ware off amazon in bulk it saves crazy money anyone complaining like it’s supposed to do anything other than the purpose served is expecting to mush from plastic cups and should invest in real dishes. I purchased the case of 1000 black plastic soup spoons, regular spoons in black and black forks and white knives in January and I’m still. It even halfway through the boxes with a household of 5 plus parties and visitors and sleepovers. I spent about 13-17 per box of 1000 and it’s been my greatest investment I purchased these 180z which were bigger so those are for my husband and I and I purchased the 16oz hefty for the kids but I’m about to find something smaller they are 10-9-8. I was spending about $5 to $8 a week in plastic products. I hate washing dishes and using my dishwasher kills the water bill for no reason. You won’t regret this purchase. I’m looking for bulk plastic plates and bowls 18oz now."
"Bought these to drink from, and they work for that purpose. What else can you say about plastic cups, really?"
"Nice sized drinking cups. Water is expensive where I live, so I use paper instead of washing dishes."
Cups arrived ontime. Undamaged. In manufacturing packaging.
The red cup lightweight and perfect size
"Nice plastic cups. And, sent in boxes in a huge box. Wonderful! Thanks for the tinder! Boxes burn clean."
"Less heavy duty than the Solo cups, but they serve the same purpose and are very reliable."
Value pack of cups
Awesome perfect in a bang for my buck. I will always keep buying them again and again.
Perfect for an alternative to the solo brand
"I usually buy the red cups from one of the warehouse stores. These are just as good, but were delivered. I like that they came in a box, in multiple sleeves. They store more easily than the single large sleeve I usually buy."
Order it now. No better.
Exactly as described
I used them for liquid drinks
I have ordered several times! Love them!
Big value durable
Great Value.
The red cups are much sturdier than the clear ones. They are similar to Solo's.
Must have for party
Regular cups nothing special
Whats not to like. I liked every bit of this RED Cup
Great quality product. Highly recommend.
Amazon red cups are greatly priced. They compare favorably to the brand name ones.Great buy.
As advertised
Solo cups is what we used to buy but they kept getting increasingly more expensive. Try these you wont go back and you’ll save money.
All the cups are sturdy and can carry whatever liquid you need it to. The fact that you can get a pack of 240 is amazing in and of itself.
"These are the best cups ever, they hold water beer soda milk juice and many other things. They don't Leak! They are also bright RED so you don't loose them I love ! them"
Worked for what we needed at the time.
Great for picnics.
Great product.
"These used to be the best cups ever. Thick, sturdy, perfect.... Now they are thin, flimsy and smell like chemicals! Back to SOLO for us."
Using for wedding good cups
Holds up after multiple uses
I don't know what you mean about warmth
Got exactly the number i needed of Red Cups for spring planting. These are the Red cup we all use and usually have to buy many more than we want. Good job Amazon
We use these all the time for church functions.
Holds liquids and ya don't have to waSH
Bought these months ago still have a ton left.
These cups are great I use them all the time I will be buying a lot more of them and they are great for party’s
No complaints
"Perfect ! Obviously it’s a cup, sturdy as the famous red ones only less expensive and higher quantities! Great deal."
"I got these cups because they had trendy color names like ""Amethyst"" and ""Paprika"" - who doesn't want to be reminded of gemstones and spices when tipping back a plastic cup of semi-cold, mediocre-quality keg beer? The big night came - I was having a large party, excited for all the ""meeting and greeting"" that would take place, and really risking a show of my personality by offering ""Apple Green"" cups to my guests. Things were going great - a plethora of colors, laughs and smiles, and ever-shrinking keg - when the unthinkable happened. Two guests who had been excessively enjoying the party got into a fight over which color was better: ""Neptune Blue"" or ""Amethyst"". The argument escalated quickly and then, when amethyst was sarcastically referred to as ""purple"", the gloves came off and an all-out brawl started. My soul was crushed - the party cups, an expression of who I am as a human being, were the cause of a fight. In a total twist of irony, one of the initial brawlers was thrown into the pool and dubbed ""Neptune Blue"". And during all of this mess someone decided to call the local law enforcement agency. When they arrived, they immediately pointed at the cups and moved in to confiscate the beverage-holding devices - apparently these have been popping up all over town - in party fights, at retail store break-ins - they even recovered ""Paprika"" cups at a bank heist. Instead of handling the situation, they gave a smiley wave to ""Neptune Blue"" and headed off to another call. Overall, these cups are incredible. The colors are breathtaking and the plastic is as sturdy as one would expect from a party beverage container. My only advice is to slowly distribute these at a party - control the situation - maybe only give them to friends you really trust. Otherwise, you just may end up with a sea god at your next party."
"Very cup-like. I needed cup-like plastic vessels for a human Winter Jesus holiday last month. The humans were pleased with how their drinks didn't leak from these vessels, as was I. I have now been fully accepted among the humans, having proved my ability at finding economically priced, quality tall plastic drinking bowls. Nanoo, nanoo."
"Bought 100 cups for $5, the purpose for basically beer pong games sans beer for Christmas with the kids. Before we played the younger kids found the cups (4,6,10) and began stacking building up all sorts of things. This kept them occupied over an hour. Can you imagine kids off technology that long without withdrawal? I was shocked, so yea worth every penny. No idea how well they hold liquid but the kids really enjoyed the stacking."
"We are a color-coordinated family: Green for DS, Aquafor me, Purple for DD and Orange for DH. We use this system for anything that comes in colors, to mark belongings, to schedule the calendar,...so imagine my delight when I found this ready-made color coordinated set! The cups are sturdy and reusable. They hold up well on the top rack of the dishwasher so we reuse them as much as possible. But my favorite use is smoothies. No more grainy mess to deal with, just rinse and recycle! If you found this review HELPFUL, please click the button below. THX!"
"My kids will each go through 10 cups a day and not think twice about it. Not a big deal if we didn’t have 5 kids lol. I got tired of running a dishwasher full of cups every night, and decided to order these and have have them each write their name on one and use it throughout the day. It has worked perfectly! These cups are great! They are durable, colorful, nice size, and don’t tip over every time my 4 year old bumps one. I love that they can be rinsed and reused multiple times a day! We also use them for all birthday parties and family gatherings. They are a staple on our subscribe and save monthly order. Definitely couldn’t live without them!!"
"Ok, I love plastic cups, less for me to wash by hand! Some plastic cups just remind me of beer. I always try finding clear cups or something cute? **These are great! Cute Spring time colors!** They’re sturdier than most plastic cups I buy! They have a good grip! The cups WILL NOT slide through your hands! And it does NOT look like a beer cup at all. Really great quality, I even reuse mine sometimes too, washing it by hand, if I only use it for a quick drink of water… I rinse it n know it’s mine. Yes, these are a bit pricey but not for what you get! Impressive:)!!"
"Thumbing through the plastic cups and stumbled upon these. Fell in love with the bright colors and at the price being offered I couldn’t go wrong. Ordered them and because of Coronavirus we (5 of us) home we went through them quickly. Ordered another pack of 100 and have put them aside. Wished I had ordered an additional pack because they are no longer available and the price had skyrocketed up to $50+ for a pack of 100. They’re your regular plastic 12oz Dixie cups, but it’s the bright almost neon colors (Lime, raspberry, blue and orange) that draws you to them. Maybe when I bring out the next set I may reuse mine a few times before tossing. Lol . It still is a good product we all have come to love AND trust BUT not for the asking price that was being offered. Since the outrages price hike Amazon is not offering it at this time. Should the seller offered it again at a reasonable price I will ODER once again."
"Little cheaper than solo cups and the quality is the same! The size is also a LITTLE smaller (I think 2-4 ozes), but that really shouldn't make a big difference to anyone unless your in a regulated beer pong contest.  These cups were also used in a weekend cabin party, and the ""game cups"" were washed a few times in hot water each day to prolong their non-grimy use. These cups held up to the hot water and were able to last the entire weekend of festivities. I would recommend these for camping, hiking, cabins, work, or even just normal use at home. The different color combos is also nice to have too."
"I don't like how milk tastes in glass or in the more solid long lasting multi-use plastic type of cups, so I tried using these instead. I don't drink alcohol but I do drink a lot of milk, and I found that it really is the best in these. Also use for juices, and the rare 2 liter of soda (instead of cans when those are out of stock often like during the pandemic).  Keeps the drink cold, doesn't 'sweat' much, and as long as you don't care about not having a lot of trash or saving the environment or something these are my top choice of cup for anything not in a can or in a water bottle."
"They're plastic cups. They work as well as the somewhat famed, often maligned, but always noticed, Solo Cup. They are not Solo brand and they are not red, so your friends will not feel the need to subject you to the musical sylings of Toby Keith while drinking from these. That may be a good thing, that may be a bad thing, depending on your feelings toward the man. If you really need to associate this cup with some Keithian music, you could always fill it with ""Beer for [Your] Horses."""
"I bought these actually thinking I was getting a good deal from Amazon. This time I was wrong. Kroger had them for the same price same brand,color and count. These are something I use everyday and I like how they are colorful and not the red ones as they usually are. They are sturdy and hold a full 16 ozs. Check prices before you buy, but I am never sorry for anything I purchase from Amazon, just disappointed I did not get the deal I thought I was getting. My own fault. Still a great cup!"
"I have Parkinson's disease, and these cups work well with my tremors. 1. Ridges help keep cup in hand. 2. If the tremors start getting more steady the ridges help keep cup in hand. 3. Cup stays firm in hand so you don't shake your beverage out due to tremors. Take in mind this is about my experiences it may not be the same for everyone."
"Easy to hold one in each hand to really get a party started!!!!! These are really fun and vibrant, so if you have a party do not invite party poopers over to ruin the party cup vibe with these cool cups. I had a recent party with these cups and was highly annoyed that the party poopers were using them. Very durable, my kids love them so much they will gladly use 5-6 in one hour and “forget” they had one earlier."
"Great Buy for a busy household. Reduces amount of dishes to clean and more time with family. Cheapest on amazon I’ve seen so I’m subscribed to these babies. Everyone in the house loves them and the different colors help to distinguish who’s cup is who’s. Win win. Just don’t squeeze the sides of the cups for any reason or they will bust a line down the side. Careful not to push cup onto ice maker directly. Use your hand to push for ice, not the cup."
"We buy these all the time. Good quality. No impromptu cracking. Inside and Out Use!! Orange Juice, Pepsi, Ice Tea or Water. We like the multi color for variety but also a good identifier for ""Who's glass is this?"" An essential at our house."
"Love the quantity, cup size, cup quality and price.  These can work as everyday or party cups. They aren't as small as the dainty 9oz cups, and they aren't the ginormous 18oz so often seen in fire engine red. These are the absolute perfect size for everything. The plastic is thick and ridged for easy holding, and with 4 colors to choose from, the whole issue of guests wondering which cup is theirs is reduced by a good 75%. I got a pack of 100 cups for under $8 and the quality is much better than the clear cups for more money. Will buy more of these when needed"
"VIBRANT- COLORFUL- GREAT SIZE!- yellow, red, deep purple and deep teal for colors! *I love having extra plastic cups on hand and these add tons of color to a party. *Sixteen ounce is the PERFECT size plastic cup, in my opinion, and I have bought MANY different sizes and brands. *These Hefty are durable. My first time ordering a 100 cups, but I do not regret, because they have been a life saver. *I have had to fill with what I may be drinking at home- besides alcohol!- and take in the car with me, they fit in the cup holder. *Nice to have different colors so cups do not get mixed up."
"We received Christmas colors! Kids were happy i was like ""who ordered these? And who ordered from Walmart?"" I am not sure why they came in a walmart box or why they changed colors but they are the correct size and correct amount i can deal with the different colors."
"This is one of the best values on Amazon that I buy frequently. You get a lot of colorful good quality cups for a cheap price. I keep plastic cups in stock and don't like to run out. We (a family of 3) can easily run through 2-4 a piece each day. We get a fresh one for every drink :).. They are disposable, so I guess we are using them correctly ...LOL"
When I finally got them the cups are great. But they had to be resent because they were delivered to somebody else’s house and I had no idea who they were delivered to. They were delivered to a house with wooden steps I have a ramp. And I could never find who had my cups.
"There isn't much you can honestly say about plastic cups other than they do their job and hold liquids without any issues. Wanted the four colors for a party to avoid cup confusion and eliminate waste from multiple cups. Served the purpose and was reasonably priced (Same has most stores) without the stress of running out to the store last minute hoping that they are available, which for some reason during the summer they tend to be impossible to find in the grocery aisles."
"These are great. They're made by Hefty so you know they're good. They are 4 different colors, so when you give a kid a glass of pop, milk, iced tea, etc., you give them a cup and if it's red you tell them to try to remember where they placed their cup and what color it is.. I really don't like when they put their cup down and don't remember where. All that beverage is then wasted. Sometime I put their name on the cup in magic marker and they can find it easily and know it's theirs. It stays on the cup and not the child."
I bought these because I loved the price! We are having a minute to win it party for my daughter's birthday and needed a bunch of these type cups for games. These will work out perfectly. Love the pricing and the quantity. The colors also offer a nice way to do teams! Nice sturdy cups!
"Bought in bulk because honestly, I was tried of constantly washing cups after my kids. They are sturdy and serve their purpose. Plan on buying another pack or 2 maybe 4 to get us through the year."
"I use these cups at my office for water and lemonade. Very sturdy, holds a good amount of water that my clients don't need to keep getting more water throughout their visit, and I like the colors. The grips on the sides are good too, to prevent slips and spills. These are my go-to cups and I'm a repeat buyer."
"These hold a lot, come in fun colors, and aren’t going to break down like paper cups if you want to stick them in the fridge overnight because you didn’t finish your drink. I like to use them for my smoothies since they can make a glass pretty gross to try and clean sometimes."
"I would recommend these cups. They're sturdy and attractive. There's a nice amount of them, too. I'm a big cup kind of person, so I do wish they were larger, but they were all that was available and were more than sufficient. Other than size, the cups are exactly what I needed for a reasonable price."
"Awesome, durable plastic party cups! I would recommend these to anyone. I know these are disposable, but they are such great quality, that I sometimes feel guilty throwing them into the trash after use! I want to wash them and use them again and again. I make my iced coffee every morning, put them into these party cups and I'm on my way! I don't know how these cups handle hot liquids, but I'm sure they are great for that too!"
These are great. Large and sturdy. It defeats the purpose but these are strong enough to wash and use again. Just wish the plastic was biodegradable.
"Very bright and colorful, it helps people will remember which color was theirs. Too bad they are no longer on S&S. Have to source them elsewhere."
These plastic cups are great for the price. They are study and just the right size. They are not as round as your traditional plastic cups; but definitely will hold 16 oz of fluids. The colors are bright and very festive.
"A summer-colors version of the ""red plastic cup"". These are the perfect size for entertaining, or just to have on hand for when you don't want to use a glass. You can also write on them with a Sharpie marker to personalize."
"Great value for the amount of cups that you get. This is by far the best deal that I have seen 4 cups like this, are usually buy my cups from Sam’s club but I think I’m going to stick with these cups for the price and the quality is a little better I think"
"No one is going to write a song about these cups, but they are good. I have 3 daughters as well as my husband and myself. The three girls get assigned a color and my hubby and I share one. It makes finding the responsible party for cups being left out willy nilly so much easier. Cups are durable, plentiful and of a good size. Can even survive a round or two in the dishwasher which surprised me. I personally wouldn't have washed them, but who am I to argue with multiple uses?"
Great product. Shipping was terrible. I had to get a ride to the post office and stand in line to pick up. Extremely inconvenient. I have Amazon prime. Why couldn't they just leave it on the porch as usual?
"Pros: they're everything you'd want in a cup and more  Con: the number in the triangle at the bottom of the cup is 6, which is on the bad list of plastics"
"Very nice colors, quite sturdy cups. None broke during a party with kids. *While not advertised for it, I actually put them in the top rack of my dishwasher. All stayed put (gentle cycle without heated drying) and came out clean! Very happy with them."
Good cup for the money! Definitely glad I have a subscription for these so I don’t ever run out. I love that they come in different colors in one package. I have my kids pick a color and they spears know which cup is theirs.
"Love these fun colors! I wanted some party cups for a fiesta party I was having and these fit the bill nicely. I do with they were a bit larger, these aren't the standard solo cup size I was hoping for, but they worked just fine. They'll last me quite a while, so I won't need to buy cups for a long time!  Colors as expected, and they were well made."
"These are my favorites cups! Very sturdy, easy to hold. The ridges on the side of the cup make them like a no slip grip. I buy these ones every few weeks."
"I purchase these cups because they are durable and sturdy and easy to hold. Plus I don't have to wash cups, you can just throw away"
"Great for children and teens dropping accidents. Reusable as dishwasher safe, colors prevents getting someone else’s drink or the wrong cup. Great to stock up on for many events and the colors brighten up plain white paper plates. I also use to start my herbs from seeds"
"You really can't beat this deal. I facilitate a middle school student council, and these cups have become our go-to. They're big, easy to spot, and sturdy. Not to mention we don't run out when 100 kids show up to a dance!"
Great deal on these. Plus the coloring makes easier identification at picnics and parties. Sturdy too. Not flimsy. No cracking issues.  Not much else to say but I'll be buying more!
"I love these hefty cups. They’re so colorful , durable and the perfect size for. Also you’re paying around $7.00 bucks for 100 cups if you the subscribe and save option! Definitely worth the money."
"We buy these for so many things. For the camper, for family reunions,just for bbqs. I love that there's different colors so we can give kids different colors. Great value on amazon. Cheaper than the local stores."
"They’re cups. They hold liquid. They don’t leak. There’s lots of them. They’re cheap. Five stars.  If you’re into the colors, then maybe it should be six stars. 8-)"
"For my sons' dinosaur party the colors were lime green, orange, and teal so this package worked perfect! We didn't use the purple ones but we'll just use them at home. I saw this in the grocery store but it was more expensive so this is a good deal. These cups are nice vivid colors, good quality, and good size. Very happy I found these."
La entrega 🚚 fue rápida y llego perfecto 👌🏼 Mis vasos de hefly 👌🏼😃
Great value. My husband and I love the different colors because we assign colors to each other to track who is wasting more cups lol silly but it helps us! These are not too thick or too thin and are a great size that fits easily in your hand but holds a good amount of drink. Definitely will repurchase.
Very dursby
Wow! What a cup! They hold liquids inside! Also solids! You get a whole bunch of them and they are so colorful! Being made out of plastic you can be sure they will be around for tens of thousands of years! All of our party guests agreed that they were plastic cups that held liquids. And solids! I would buy again but I still have so many!
I'm so glad I ordered these & probably will again. They are great & you get all these nice colors as well. Just the right size too. You wont be sorry you bought them.
"Bought these for a birthday party. I had read some negative reviews, but I went ahead and purchased anyway. I'm happy I did. I wanted to save some money but not sacrifice quality, and I feel that's exactly what I got."
I don’t care what people say or think. These save money! Having to use the dishwasher for every little thing gets expensive. Dumb kids just grab a new glass every time. Well not anymore!
"I ordered these cups for the holidays for the family dinner, exactly what I needed, they were durable, so so easy to use,, I will order more when I run out of these and the colors was awesome, ❤️"
"I use these for all types of stuff in the garden. From starting seeds to measuring nutes, to scooping soil, these always come in handy. Suppose you could use them for drinks as well!"
Had a BBQ for the holiday. These worked perfect to cut down on dishes. Plus it has enough that we are stocked up for a couple more get togethers. I like how easy they are you write on so you know whose drink is whose.
"These cups are hard to find for some reason, but the are great and the quantity is good."
Family of 4 each gets their own color during this time! That alone made these my new favorite reusable/disposable cups. Perfect size. Sturdy. No complaints!
Wonderful to have free delivery instead of going shopping!! Came very quickly and saved me time!!! Thank you!!! Great quality and colors!!!
"These cups are perfect for our household. They are durable and come in cute colors. I buy them regularly, I may have to look into a subscription."
I bought because we have a water cooler and always have plastic cups by it. I feel like I am always going through plastic cups so this was perfect! I love the multi colors and for a 100 cups with a add on price I couldn't have gotten a better deal! I will be adding this on in the future for sure!!
"The cups are great! I bought them because, one, I don't like washing drinking glasses all the time, so it's nice to have something disposable, and two, plastic fairs far better than reusable when drinking with friends around the bonfire.  HOWEVER, I would like Amazon to know that my package was delivered to my next door neighbor. This wasn't awful, because my neighbors are hella cool, but I do have my own front porch, guys. (Unless the USPS delivered instead of Prime, cause then it's the post office's fault and we're working to fix that.)"
"We love these cups in our house! They are bright and colorful and perfectly sized for small hands. They can be rinsed out in soapy water, rinsed and reused, but they don't *have* to be, of course. We keep a permanent marker in the kitchen to write names, initials or little pictures on them when the whole gang is here."
I love these cups!! I keep them on hand always! They are the perfect party cup because you can choose different colors so you don't loose track of your drink. They are also perfect for you standard slew of drinking games!! I have purchased these cups twice now and have them in my cart to purchase again. The colors are vibrant and the cup is sturdy!
"This product can be used for a variety of things. Beverages , milk, soda, juice ,even ice cream. Received in perfect condition. Assorted colors."
Perfect for my paint crafts. Beautiful colors and all seemed to be in perfect condition. No cracks or broken bottoms like uve seen in some.
"These cups live up to the Hefty brand, sturdy and colors are nice. Price was on par with the stores and I didn't have to drive to get them so it was a no-brainer."
Good disposable plastic Cups! Variety of nice colors and 16 oz for me is just right! They are fairly sturdy and much less expensive then other leading brands. Does the job!!
These cups are the bomb! Replaced my kids plastic cups for these and there is no nasty plastic taste when you drink out of them no matter what you pour on them. I recently put 1 in the microwave and it did not damage the cup. Super pleased with this purchase that even i like drinking out of them (:
Cups are good size and I have had no problems with their wear. They go through the dish washer and are used by my 17month old. They are perfect.
"These are durable, as in my kids haven’t broken them yet. Have had them for a few months now and the colors are still great, dishwasher safe, and perfect size for my kids and even us grown cups for juice in the mornings and a quick bedtime snack. Perfect for dipping cookies in milk. Love that they are eco friendly too!"
"Love these cups. Very durable. Kid and adult friendly. I wish they came in a single color to match the plates and bowls I got, but this still works. Our friends' kids get to choose their own color, which is always cute. Highly recommend."
My son was able to use these in college. No worry about breakage. Microwave safe
These are amazing! Dishwasher friendly and super cute colors!
"Have I really found the plastic alternative cups for my little ones?? These cups are durable, colorful, do not possess any weird aftertaste or smell, they are just cups! Whether or not they are compostable remains to be seen since I’m not in a position to want to bury any (just yet) but I will. Hopefully it doesn’t take 500 years for them to decompose since that wasn’t the point of me seeking out a eco-friendly option. Lots of brands these days are taking advantage of the keywords, “environmentally friendly” without really having to prove it. I will stand behind a company that produces high end ethical and sustainable products if they can really prove it, so I intend to run my own “bury” test on one of these straw-based cups in the near future and I’ll update my post accordingly."
"Very pleasant to drink out of and I'm an adult. I have been drinking more water with these...Perhaps because I am subconsciously afraid of glass. Made perfectly and I love the size. I don't like to drink more than this amount at a time anyway. My kids love them too. I ordered a second set because they are in the dishwasher 1/2 the time. For those of you that are super eco-conscious- look up how the world beaches are running out of silica for all of our glass and how they are now ruining ocean wildlife by getting it from the ocean floors. There's a great documentary on it. Besides, glass will inevitably send you to the emergency room. I also often wonder if miniscule pieces of glass go in our stomach, blood stream, muscles and organs. Stainless steel makes water taste metallic which means heavy metal poisoning probably.  Update: Have had these for almost two years now. Still going strong and my whole family loves them. We use them daily."
"these cups are not 12 oz cups, I poured a 16 oz water bottle into one and I only could fit half of the bottle in so they should be recommended as 8 oz not 12. but I bought them for when my grandchildren come, I am tired of plastic cups half full laying all over and no one knowing whose is whose, so I will put names on them and hopefully that works besides saving money not buying those plastic cups"
"These glasses are subtly beautiful and sturdy , comfortable in the hand and the right size for a satisfying drink. At this price you can't make a mistake purchasing these unusually made glasses. Why unusual? They are made of wheat straw. I never heard of wheat straw before now. Based on these lovely glasses, I think it is going to be a popular material. Try these. Your purchase is too reasonably priced to regret. These are lovely."
"I have purchased these from more than one distributor. this one is the better of them. smooth, durable, no defects. Can't say the same for competitor's. will go with these again. Definitely would refer to friends and family. Its a perfect child drinking cup, or even bathroom cup."
"They are really nice cups but definitely, kids size. My 10-year old mentioned they were small orange juice cups. He drinks too much anyone so these are perfectly sized for him. I am replacing our old, nasty, plastic mismatched cups that are probably leaking chemicals in our beverages. If they were available in a larger size I would order even more."
"I've recently replaced all my dishware with these eco friendly materials and I love them. These are the perfect size for a small drink, sometimes I'll use them for hot coffee. They're holdable with it."
"I bought these to use in the bathroom when my grandkids visit - each child gets their own color cup to use. They’re perfect for that! They are sturdy and clean easily, but best of all - they’re unbreakable!!!"
"Neuropathy has me dropping and breaking my favorite glasses. I don’t like plastic cups. These little cups are great and they don’t stink or effect my drinks plus if I drop them in the sink, they don’t break."
"The color, size, and durability of these glasses is great. Easy to clean and safe to use with children without concern that they will break if dropped. No signs of damage yet and we’ve had them a few months. Very easy to clean. Holds 8 oz so it’s definitely great for portion control."
"I bought them to use as a bathroom cup, thinking they’d be easy to throw away after the minerals in my water ruined them. I find that they are a perfect size and feel. I don’t think I’ve ever “enjoyed” using a cup before 😁! They feel very sturdy, but I haven’t had them long enough to really know."
"What a super product! I bought these cups for my husband and I and our teen to use for those times when you want just a bit of water to sip on in the evenings, milk with dessert, or juice with breakfast. The colors are lovely and the material is nice and smooth; washes well."
These cups are so easy to clean and are so simple yet elegant. They are on the smaller side but perfect for little hands and the colors are beautiful and pastel.
Great for my toddler who can't seem to sit still. I was using a sippy cup but wanted to train my toddler to be careful with an open cup. I don't know how many times it fell and it was still in great shape. Perfect size for little hands to grasp. Love the colors.
"I love the colors, the size but they scratch easily. You can't even use the other side of the sponge when you wash them. Even a plastic knife will scratch them. I wouldn't drink anything that stains or put hot things in them. I don't understand why they are so pricey. The prices are ridiculous and I kinda regret buying them. I am wondering how much these cost in China."
"I was searching for differently colored cups to use as water cups for the family. We were washing about 10+ cups a day. With this color coordinated system, each family member uses their own cup for water and washes accordingly. Saved loads of time and $ on cup washing."
These little cups have been perfect for RV living. Not too big and easy to clean. Perfect for children to as they don’t break easily. Cute colors and perfect size.
When I have a bunch of family staying they all have a cup. No disposable plastic cups. They have a nice weight and feel.
These cups wash well in the dishwasher - they dry and don’t need extra toweling before putting away like some plastic cups. Size is great - I did any want huge cups. We really like them!
""
"It’s a cup. Does what a cup does. I must say though, this cup does what no other cup does. It cups. I mean it must cup…"
"These are great little cups, not too tiny but not huge. Perfect for our family of 5 in the bathroom."
Easy to clean but they are very small child size cups..I should have read description better. All in all they are a good product though. Holds enough beverage to get a few drinks
"The only reason I give some 4 stars is I don't know how long they will hold up. I have heard about delamination issues. None for me so far, I also have the bowls, and hey if they do go sideways? Just toss em in the backyard! Fully biodegradable."
These are very nice and sturdy. They are good quality.
"Love them! I got these because its just me and my husband and his dad comes down to visit. We never use cups ourselves, but when papa is here he uses cups and leaves them around the house and drops them. These are so durable! He's dropped them already so many times and not even a scratch!!"
These are perfect for the camper. They don't weigh them down and they are super lightweight to have. They are easy to pick up and super easy to clean.
I love these cups so much that I bought another set.
"I ordered these tumblers for my mother, who had arthritis and couldn't hold wider or heavier cups. They worked very well, and I kept them after she passed."
"Easy to clean, durable and stylish! I let me little kids drink out of these because they are smaller and easier for them to grip."
"These are smaller than I expected, but that is my fault. I should have measured. They are great quality though. Definitely won’t break! Would be perfect if we had young children but ours are older. Pretty colors too. Good for a quick drink of water or juice in the morning."
"I really like this cups, they’re cute and just what i was expecting. Love the color"
"It was good to find an eco-friendly product that stood up to the dishwasher and the outdoor dinner time fun with the kids. It is perfect for camping, bbq's, or just everyday use."
"Great cups, small for kids and adults."
"I don’t know what they mean by warmth, but these cups are good. They are on the small side but the photos are accurate. I go through 2 or 3 cups of water in a meal with these. I also sometimes put snacks in them."
We love these cups so much. They are super durable and great for the kids! I also like how easy they are to clean. We needed quality plastic cups because with kids glasses just keep breaking. These are awesome!
Muy bonitos
"Not cheap plastic, these are nice cups. They feel good in your hand too. Perfect size, just what I needed, thanks!"
The cups are very aesthetic and as an Israeli that cares for the environment the fact that they are biodegradable is great. The texture is great- they don’t slip from the hand but smooth. I recommend
"These are nice, light weight, easy to clean cups. My children use them often."
These cups are sturdy and easy to clean. My kids use these every day and they have held up well. Very pleased with this purchase
Actually kind of classy in a way. Would never break/nice quality.
These are small but I have grand and great grand kids who will benefit from these. Love that they are so durable. No breaking! 🥰
I bought these for my grandchildren to use and they are wonderful. I like that they are eco-friendly.
Not gonn a lie it took a bit to get used to the inside of the cups.. But now that I did its nice.
Great quality and design and durable
great colors and easy for my children's little hands
good product for the money. dishwasher safe. plastic is thick not thin
I love the colors and I can use them outside.
Just what I was looking for to use in our bathrooms.
"I absolutely love these cups. The colors are cute and tasteful. They are very thick and durable. As soon as they came in, ordered more."
Great cups to use everyday. Durable and dishwasher safe. You’ll love these cups!
I loved the cups overall no issues.
"Love these cups, they are cute, stackable, & durable enough for RV life!"

"I had an issue with the lids not staying on. Support contacted me and told me I have to press down really hard until I hear the click. Lo and behold, the lid stayed on!  Updating my review to 5 stars. Great support too!"
"I bought two boxes to decorate for my niece's birthday party. I haven't had a chance to test the color changing yet, but I didn't think to match the tops up with the cups when I started the project. When I was almost finished I started putting the tops on and ended up with 6 tops that didn't go with any of the cups so I had to mix and match 3 for my project and left with 3 undecorated that don't match tops either. REALLY REALLY Annoyed! I should have checked before starting and returned for matching tops but now here I am"
""
"Just as the picture shows, the cups and the lids/straws are different colors. The lids and straws match the color the cup TURNS to when cold. Cool concept, but kind of bothers me. Other than that, they are great cups."
I bought these to help my older mother with spills. Would recommend because they look like adult cups but added safety of the lid. Planning to purchase the smaller set as well.
I would definitely recommend these cups they don’t spill I love the straw I love the colors and the fact that their large the whole plenty of liquids
"I am in love with these cups. They are awesome for on the go, or for the kids. The seller is awesome and helps with any problems. Will be buying again"
"Loved everything about this purchase. Packaging, quick delivery, colors, kept beverage cold. Excellent quality. Highly recommend"
"Made cups for Christmas gifts, using a cricut machine"
Good for on the go drinks like smoothies and juices.
I use them for my protein smoothies! Great cups
These cups are really good! I’ve never had cups that have lasted so long!
"Me and my whole family love these cups. They barely leake, and the color changes almost as soon as you put anything cold in them. There is just one problem you can NOT pick them up by the lid.  Hope this helps"
Perfect for iced coffee!
I loved these cups. Don’t expect leak proof that’s common sense. But they are fun and convenient and super easy to clean
"These cups are awesome! especially for the price! the lids are a perfect size, the cups are cute, and all around a great purchase!"
Very durable! Love them!
These are great. They get me to drink more water.
""
"Good, portable, pretty, for my drinks"
I love everything about this cup except that the lids do not snap or securely seal off the cup. The lid basically sits freely on top of the cup and doesn’t not prevent spills.
"I want to give them 5 stars but they just sweat too much. I don’t like a puddle of water under my drinks. Plus the lids suck and aren’t always fastened tightly. I do love the color change factor, size, and ease to clean. I still use them everyday- I just always put a paper towel Under them and try every lid until I get the best fit."
I really like these cups. I would've given a 5☆ rating if the lids fit correctly even though those two cups didn't change color like the other 4.
The lids dont even stay on. They just sit on top. What is the point of a lid if it just sits there and doesnt secure on? So if you want a color changing cup with a straw then this is great otherwise the lids are useless.
Some of the lids done click on and the color only changes with super cold water.. Otherwise I like the size of the cups and even though it said they aren't dishwasher safe I accidentally put one in and it was fine
"Lids just sit on top and aren’t secure at all. Also not dishwasher or freezer safe, or double wall insulated, just a plastic cup. Straw cleaning tool included was the best part."
Lids fit tight for first or second use. Now they pop right off just by holding the cup. Cup is decent but defeats the purpose of buying a cup with a lid when lid isn't secure.
I really wanted to give these 5 starts but I just can’t. 2 lids wouldn’t latch on to any of the cups when I first got them & they still won’t. Over a few washes they become harder & harder for the lids to stay on. They are easy to hold & the perfect size. I do love the straws as well but I bought them for my 78 year old dad & I’ve had to clean up after lids have failed. Over all they were worth the price even though I couldn’t use 2 lids. I’m not sure I’d purchase again though.
"I really liked these cups as far as the color changing but the lids do not stay on, I picked the cup up full of soda by the top the lid come off cup fell to the floor and splashed soda everywhere."
Updated 2-16-22. Customer service reached out and sent me new ones. However the lids still do not fit well. I changed the rating based on thr quick response and quick shipment of new Cups.  Cups are good. Lids are not. I only have two that will fit. The rest will not fit on any cups. So I 6 cups and 2 working lids. Other than that. Easy to clean 👌
I bought these for cold coffees but the lids do not close all the way. The cups are good but I wish the lids actually closed. Would make life easier. They do retain a little odor at times not use if it's because of the combination of coffee and oat milk or just the cups in general.
"I love these cups. Not all of them really change colors, but they serve their purpose. Be careful to follow instructions and hand wash only. The material is not durable enough to withstand the heat from a dishwasher, even on the top rack. They will become a little wonky and the lids wont stay on well. Other than that, love them!"
For some reason the lids and cups do not match but they are good cups.
Some tops where hard to put on and one won’t stay on not all tops and straws match the cups but that’s okay overall satisfied
They are really nice cups except the lid doesn’t stay on 🙄
"Great cups but after a couple of uses, the lids aren't fitting very well..."
These would’ve been great if the lids fit and stayed on. They do not and are basically trash.
Don't waste your money. Lids are loose and messes are made
Missing the straws
"I received the cups and they were packaged very well, however the lids did not fit on the cups at all some snapped on and some didn’t. I had to figure out which kids worked, 3 lids didn’t snap on the product."
Eh
Missing the straws
"A fun set of 6 cups + lids with reusable straws.. with a special power to color change when filled with cold content.. WoW! TBH, its a bit gimmicky but regardless of all the “shade shifting” these are a decent option.. especially used for a group event or poolside. I appreciate the varied colors help identify who’s is who’s.. (especially at tail end of a pandemic.)  Perks: •Straw has a ringed stopper so they won’t fall out. •Lids keep spills to a minimum. •6 color options- identify cup by assigning colors! •Lids are interchangeable within the set. •dishwasher safe  Quirks: •Cup sweat! a lot condensation w/o using a sleeve. •6 colors: 3 variations are blue- would be far better if these hues were a lot more diverse!! •stickers are cute but only semi waterproof! Best used as identifiers for a user..  Cups feel sturdy and durable with just the right amount of bendability to keep from being shatterproof. *Note: we found interchanging lids made these more recognizable to the assigned user.. set includes stickers that can help identify as well. Problem is- these do peel after a few washes. Nicely sized for a variety of uses. For $19 you will receive 6 complete cups- we ordered for 21st wknd hotel poolside getaway.. these kept everyone happy with a drink in hand. Hoping info can help make your decision- stay safe everyone!"
"I wanted to love these, but as soon as I opened them, I knew I wouldn't. For one, the lids, cups, and straws don't match. The cups themselves are all light pastels, the lids, with one exception, are all very vivid. The straws are all over the place in color family. The parts in total are not even the same color families for pretty mix and matching. We started with a yellow cup and pale blue lid - the only lid NOT vibrant because the one yellow lid was vibrant and clashed with the pastel yellow terribly. I added a custom vinyl sticker for my daughter. That part was great - if you want these for custom cups, the vinyl will stick perfectly. After the sticker was good and cured, we tried cold water for the color change... Unless you FILL the cup with FREEZING COLD water, the color change is almost non-existent. If you totally fill it with iceberg water, it is a bit more noticeable, but still not as bright as what is pictured. The lids don't snap on well, so I wouldn't recommend these for clumsy folks or kids who don't have a good grip on bigger cups. They will definitely leak if tipped, even if not tipped all the way to the straw hole. Overall, not awful, but definitely not as nice as I expected, either. The mismatched sets, especially when the product image is EXACT matches, was the biggest upset for us."
"This is a great set of summer cups for an outdoor gathering minus the bugs in your drink. I personally like the vivid colors. The lids seal everything up nice and tight so make sure you hear that little pop when it clicks into place so that it is secure. The kids like the color changing effect and the fact that these cups come with stickers that they can play with and ""liven up"" the cups. The straws are very sturdy and fit perfectly down into the cup itself. It also comes with a straw cleaner that you can actually insert down into the straws to make sure that everything's coming out in case you serve smoothies or something similar that may be a thick drink. So they are easy to clean, this is something you can use for everyday around the house (when you have someone that might be a little bit more accident prone) or you can use them for a party. The color change is something that most kids find really cool!"
"These are perfection for party favor cups, teacher appreciation week, or any other kind of quick and easy gift. I added vinyl decals with sayings or their names to each cup. I filled each cup with either a gift card (for teacher's week), or candy, cheap sunglasses, and a play pack for my kid's birthday party. They have been a huge hit! Perfect for ice coffee, water, or adult pool side beverages ;) The color change is subtle, but definitely there, and my kids love it. The lids could be a little more secure (especially when given to kids), but they don't just fall off or anything. Comes with a cleaning sponge as well. I love that the straws have the stopper on them, so they can't just be pulled out!. For the price, you can't beat this set!"
"This is a fun set of cups. I had gotten one cup like this through a mixed package I receive monthly and wanted more of them so I could switch them up for washing. This is the 2nd set I have tried, and this one I have to say is not quite as good as the first set, but it is fairly comparable. The color changes a little slower to me on this set, and the tops are not quite as snug and secure to me as the other set, but they both still work well, and I have not had an issue with leakage of the tops if they get toppled over accidently and picked up quickly. The one thing that is unique about this set is they have stickers you can apply yourself or not use at all, so that might make this one more fun for kids. I left them off so not sure how they would do washing."
"These Meoky color changing cups are so much fun. It came with 12- 24 oz cups, lids and straws. It also came with waterproof stickers that you and your kids and put on the cups. We're always on the go and these cups have come in handy so many times. The kids love them because they can mix and match the colors and they change colors as well when you put cold liquid in them. Food-grade BPA-free plastic is what the cups and lids are made out of. These cups come with there own brush to clean them as well. Price is great for 12 of these that we will use all summer long. If we lose a few a long the way its cool as they were cheap enough."
"These are the best things ever. Seriously so fun! They change color super easy and have lots of fun colors. And it comes with the perfect cleaning tools (even a little straw cleaner). I checked the lid tightness/seal and it seemed to hold up well. It just snaps on, instead of twisting. So I would still be a little careful of doing anything crazy. But for your basic stuff it will work great. And with a pack of 6, I feel like this is the best deal ever! Perfect for gift giving too. 100% recommend!"
"i love these color changing cups, they are in my camping/outdoor stuff, they change to a purple color and love that. they are a variety of colors, lids and straws along with the straw cleaning that comes with it so you can keep reusing the straws which i like to reduce waste in the landfills. keeps drinks semi cold but not cold cold, they have had many uses already this spring/summer and will be used many more times.  I think these are my favorite cups so far. well made and BPA Free."
"These tumblers are so nice for the price. They are nice to have to use for juice, smoothies, ice cream floats, slushies, milkshakes and so much more!  They are nice quality and the lids snap on securely. The straws are a nice size too.  My kids love that they change colors with cold drinks. You can see in the photo where the color changed after tilting the cup. So neat!  Added bonus: They come with stickers to decorate! So cool!"
"The cups work as advertised, changing color when a cold liquid is introduced. I appreciate that the logo is relatively small, since it gives the cups a clean look. Some color changes are more apparent than others (i.e light green -> blue looks a lot nicer than orange -> red imo), but all of them look at least okay. I personally didn't choose to use the included stickers, but I can see how it would be fun for kids to decorate and personalize their own cups."
These are good-sized beverage cups that have the mildly entertaining feature of changing color when hot or cold liquids are poured into them. The instructions warn against washing them in the dishwasher if you want to maintain the color-change; but I find it to be something I wouldn’t care about if it went away. The plastic is flexible and won’t shatter if the glass is dropped. Them straws and lids are a nice inclusion if you use them with kids.
I live off protein smoothies. Trying to fit a blender's worth of juice in my car has been tough. This plastic cup fits perfectly into a car cup holder. And it fits in my hand so I can drink while I'm driving. And the straw has a divet in it so it will not fall out while driving. And it cleans with the greatest of ease. Add in the the color changing element when the cup gets cold and this is golden!
The big hit of the summer are cups! The kids are requesting these cups because they change colors depending on the liquid temperature inside them. The cups are durable and very well made. They have leak proof lids and straws included. These cups are simple to clean and ready for another round of fun.
"I gave these to my students for the end of the school year and they loved them. They got to pick their own color for cup, lid, straw and even stickers! It comes with a brush to wash the straws and a sponge to wash the cups."
"My kids love these cups!! So fun when they change color. Bummer is they only change same color just darker, but still fun! Need coasters with these tho as they do sweat."
These are great for the summer can give each guest their own cup instead of using disposable cups mix and match lids and cups to make it unique
These are great parting giftbag stuffers for my ladies night that I'm planning. I love the colors and the color change factor.
"Although it’s not a drastic colore change, it’s fun to have in the house instead of disposable cups when you have kids over."
Nice cups sturdy and lids fit well. I like that I have cups to go
What is the point of a lid if the lid slides right off? It does not tighten to the cup whatsoever. It's completely useless. Cute cups but totally worthless.
These are nice cups. My only complaint is some of the lids don't fit well.
Lids do not snap down tight
"I love these cups, I got them for my birthday and I think they are amazing. They give you an option to mix and match lids and straws which I find super cute. They also came with a cup and straw cleaner which I find amazing. When I placed an order I received a message from the supplier with common questions and care instructions. This was a surprise because many suppliers don’t take the time to put that level of care into their products. I would purchase these again and trust anything from this supplier!"
They clean easy but the lids don't stay on once they have been washed in the dishwasher
Lids pop off
Great product
"The cups are fine and especially useful with all the virus problems, easy to use and easy to clean up."
Did the job
Arrived on time description is accurate.
AAA
"Perfect for what I need and the right price. However, I ordered 4 packages of 100 cups each. I only received 1 package of 100 cups. The accuracy of the order is the problem. Need them for a school activity next week! ugg!!!"
"Size: 100 Count 4 Packs; Perfect for what I need. Sadly I ordered 4 packages of 100 cups each. I only received 1 package of 100 cups. The accuracy of the order is a major major issue with this I really can not afford to go anywhere due to having a weak immune system and I am currently taking care of someone else who is sick who can not afford to get covid-19 we are both just trying to get a few extra cups to last us a while, Hoping contacting support can fix this."
love the cups. but said there were 400 cups for$37.97 and they only sent 100 cups for that price. I used that package thinking the other 3 would come later I can't return them I would just like to have the other 3 packages or a refund for the other 3. No one would pay that for only one package we are being taken advantage of and no one seems willing to correct this. who would exspect to have to read reviews on cups?
"I initially only received one package, so I contacted Amazon support. They contacted the seller and the other three were shipped.  The cups themselves are quite nice. In received holiday colors rather than spring colors, but I'll be using them to start plants so that's fine. They're sturdy and slimmer than typical solo cups."
"Supposed to be 4 pack , only got 1"
When I received my order it consisted of 100 cups instead of the 4 pkg. of 100. The order was 300 short and no way to report as you only get the option to return and I do not need to return I just need to receive the 300 missing.
Good
"Do not order, description is very mis-leading. Ordering a 4-pack only recieved 1-package of 100 cups."
"The description clearly says ""400 total"" and it is only 100 cups in 4 stacks!! $40??!!! I didn't think I needed to read the reviews on plastic cups!! BUT I should have. Customer service chat, however, DID help me out with refund quickly and efficiently!!"
"Bought for the break room, the boys love these cups and for the price, i cant beat them. They hold up nice and are great for all day use."
I only received partial order. The remaining order came broken.
Serving patients water while visiting with doctor and for staff use
They only send you 100 cups and the description says 400.
"Be careful, I was billed for 400 cups and only received 100 cups, highly do not recommend"
I didnt get all the cups. Only one pack.
"The cups are fine, however, they are being advertised as 400 cups. There are not 400 hundred cups in the package, there are only 100 cups TOTAL, in 4 stacks. Each stack contains 25 cups. You only get 1 package of cups, so be aware of this before ordering."
I only received 1 bag of 100 cups in my package. There were supposed to be 4 bags of 100 cups for a total of 400 cups. I only have 100 cups.
"Description not accurate. Only received 100 cups for $37. Description says 400 cups. 4 packs of 100.  Cups look to be of normal Hefty quality. But since I only received 25% of my order, I am returning for a refund."
Do not buy! The quantity is listed wrong and you will NOT get all your cups!
It says 400 count and each order came with 100 count! I bought 2 in quantity because I needed the 800 cups for 2 different events. These are good cups I just want the renaming of the order I was told in the description I was receiving.
"I only received 1 pack of cups totaling 100 cups, missing 3 packs totaling 300 cups.  Please send the 300 cups that I paid for."
"Purchased the pack of 4 (100 count each) and only received 1 pack. Came home, wife already opened it, stopping me from returning it."
I ordered and paid for 4 packs and I only got 1 pack
"I paid for 4 packs of 100 and only received 1 pack of 100, Please remedy this situation."
Only received 100 cups of 400 advertised. Major false advertising!!!!!!
Ordered the pack of 4 and only received 1 pack of 100 cups.
My son ordered this accidentally and I am so grateful for the company! They are awesome! I will definitely buy hefty again in the future!
"These Hefty cups, 30 count, can hold 'boiling' hot cocoa, with steaming milk froth.  Steaming, directly out of stove top pan on 'High,' these Hefty cups don't break or deform!  Shipping to my address has been fair, with no dents or tears during transit; all cups come perfect, like from a Grocery store shelf!  We really compare these Hefty cups as Solo quality, as there is really good quality control with this product!"
"With the advice from gardener Brian (Next Level Gardening) these cups are very useful for starting seeds. Fill half full with potting mix and add a couple seeds. Top with 1/4"" more potting soil. Fill with more dirt as the plant grows up to the top of the cup. This enables strong roots to develop. When it's ready to plant, carefully invert the cup and put the seedling in your garden, pot, bag or raised bed. I will be getting more of these sturdy cups soon."
We were having company and my granddaughter asked me to get cups so they can take them into the swimming pool without breaking anything I checked out the original red cups which were so expensive just to throw away. So I went on Amazon and found these and they worked just as well maybe not as thick that serve the purpose and the girls were happy. I would definitely recommend
"These are Hefty’s entry into the 18 ounce plastic cup arena. The only brand I like better is Solo, particularly the Solo Squared. In any case, these cups are practically indestructible. If you choose to you can rinse and reuse them many times but if you did you probably wouldn’t want disposable cups in the first place. I certainly wouldn’t mind it if they were a little less expensive"
"We use these Hefty cups for lots of different things - they work well, are durable, easy to hold, and the design makes it easy to measure. I wish they came in different colors but the red is bright and a true red. These could be even better if they came with more in the package."
These take the place of my mini planting pots. I use these to germinate my vegetable seeds. Gives vegetable a great head start indoors . You can also use these cups to drink with if you’re at the beach or at a barbecue. It’s likely what they are intended for.
Who can't live without Solo cups? They are the most handiest cup ever and when you find a deal on Amazon order as many as ya can!! We love our Solo cups.
"I use these. They’re what one would expect. Nothing more, but also nothing less. They “squeeze” easily. If you’re looking for strength and sturdiness, use two together. Or buy the other brand."
"Now these, they're the best, when you have no cups washed. They're cheaper than solos but they'll do the job great and then it'll do its job all over again! Unless cracked."
Cups are great and reusable and strong saves water
You know these cups... they are perfect for so many needs. Perfect for outside socially distant gatherings. Will def get again.
I was thankful that these are at least sturdy ENOUGH. If just a touch sturdier I would never use anything else to drink cold liquids.
"Always have these cups on supply. Very sturdy, easy to hold. Great for when the power is out!"
"18 once, good for keggers"
Never disappointed with these! They are sturdy!
Exactly as promised. Very durable. Quick delivery. Recommended.
I like these cup to use for on the go ...hot or cold drink ready. I like that you can wash and reuse.
They are red solo cups. They held their purpose for my daughters Berry first birthday.
"Just as ordered, arrived in timely manner, all was good."
"Great size, very sturdy - you can wash them if you want to reuse. These don't tip over"
They are sturdy cups and easy to hold.
We use them for stacking and playing games. They are sturdy and bright.
The cups a study. Great price quick shipping
"Nothing says party like a red solo cup, even if they are "" Hefty."""
Great cups
"Loved them! Sturdy, the red is bright and beautiful."
Good cups
Love these cups.. bought many times and will continue to do so!
"very sturdy, would purchase again."
"Cheap good red solo cups-the lips of the rims are a little off (they're like melted or thin or something....the rims aren't smooth all of the way around and seem like they were warped just the slightest bit at the top). Does this affect drinking from them? No. Are they still perfect for beerpong? So far, yes. Cheapest on amazon for red solo cups I was able to find."
I used this product for on -the -go smoothies!
Came in time for our Christmas party.. they were exactly what we needed & expected
The disposable cups are great value. Good for parties and holding drinks. Not good for reuse…
Was as described and expected! Ty!
"Good for drinking liquids from, playing flip cup, and beer pong. At least that's what my five year old told me."
Good price on large quantity of well made disposable cups.
Works
Hefty is dependable and good for disposable cups.
I use them for starting seeds I just snip an edge out of the bottom with scissors to drain and use them year after year.
Solid disposable cups
Cups are cups
good
Usual great hefty quality.can be disposable or reusable
Got these at a great price!
"There is not much I can say about disposable cups, They are good for parties when you don't have to use your glassware. Then you throw them away. Some can be re-use. They hold up very good in the dish washer. Let them dry and use them again."
Great!
Very sturdy
Very good product and fast delivery
great value
Great buy
"Love the grip idea, love the cups, perfect for parties, reunions or get togethers. The perfect size and easy to stock or store. The grip makes it easy to hold and sometimes even prevents accidents. Always loved these cups. <3"
Good
Very good cups!
Great for party's and family gatherings. I love Hefty brands.
Great for drinks or pong
Good quality solo cups. Good price as well
These cups are a great buy and are so sturdy they can be all day!
These Hefty plastic cups are excellent drinking cups and easily hold any beverage and they are both functional and attractive
good
Came on time. Always great to have these on hand .
These are durable and affordable.
Exactly the ones you are used to! Nice thick amd sturdy cups! Recommend
Good
"A peerless, sturdy, classic that is well made. As we have long outgrown kegs, these cups have remained on the shopping list. Perfect not only for to-gos, but for drinks that are a pain to wash out of the glass- protein shakes, smoothies, etc..."
"These hefty ultimate easy grip cups are my only go to plastic cups. They are deep enough to carry the amount of ice, and beverage I like. The easy grip helps me hold on with my small hands, when condensation occurs on hot days. The plastic does not crumble, cave, crack or break. The stability alone is enough for me to be a repeat and dependable customer to these cups. I think the they are a great value, and I would recommend them for your next party. You really can't go wrong. I know some of my friends even wash and reuse them, they are so sturdy. I paid for these, but should you have any additional questions I could possibly answer I would be happy to help out. Summer is winding down, so stock up and don't worry about the plastic ware enjoy friends, family and weather instead!!"
"These are great to have around for parties and casual events. They hold a lot, and I'm never concerned about leakage or spilling."
They are normal red cups!
Good price
GREAT
What can I really say? These are great for parties and barbecues. Great value good price
"I personally, love these small cups. However, don’t get them if you’re going to have a house full of people with lots of children. Kids just go through ‘em faster than a roaring river!"
Is what it is
Cups arrived quickly and were exactly as expected.
Great solo cups! Not a a ton to say about these but the value was great and shipping was quick as always.
"I've purchased these 3 or 4 times, and every single time 70% of the cups are unsafe to use due to strange blemishes, marks, and deformations within the plastic."
I use it at night for my nighttime meds. I also like the size and sturdy ness. It works well for me and what I use it for.
Thought bought larger size but very sturdy and theses look more for like cocktail drinks …..
Easy to hold they were worth the price
"its very strong, lasts for several days and they bounce! ha!"
They were great I used them for Christmas Light decorations
too expensive for the amount of cups you get in this package
Ok
Good cups. fairly basic but do the job you want
Nice cups but not worth the price tag. These are more so for kids
Expected a sturdier cup for the cost.
TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!! ridiculous!!! this cost 50 cents to make at a factory ! and made in china!
"They're plastic cups, duh. What's to rate."
Perfect for my crafting
"I ordered this for the office I work to use as water cups. They are great, not too small or too large, just right. I also just started a food truck business this month and we sell natural flavored waters like Horchata, limeade, Jamaica (hibiscus tea beverage) in addition to coffee and hot chocolate and am considering using these products for my own business. Great deal, good quality and so easy to order with no unpleasant surprises when delivered. Thank you!"
Great cups for the price I wasn’t paid to give a review I actually buy disposable dishes Bcuz my kids hate doing dishes And I’m not gonna cook and clean dishes
"Great plastic cups at a great price! These were so cheap, I wasn't sure what to expect of their quality, but they far exceeded my expectations. And they look great too, nice and clear, not cloudy."
"Before the Pandemic, we would NEVER use a plastic cup - bad for the environment and taste of contents. But so as not to infect or reinfect, we turned to these during this time and have been so pleased. Feel a bit guilty about the environment, but more than balanced out by peace of mind, especially since the cost is incredibly minimal for such a large quantity."
"Overall these clear cups are a great value for 240 cups. Their sturdy, durable, and thickness of them still keeps a cold drink with 1/2 cup/ice for above average amount of time! Great Buy! These Cups WILL be on my REORDER list!!"
"We got these, along with several other sized, similar disposable cups to use when our bar/restaurant moved to outdoor service during the pandemic. We needed to save money, in our efforts to stay afloat until this nightmare has passed. We have been very happy with the quality, and so far haven't encountered any of the issues described by others."
"These cups are exactly what I needed for my kids (age 3 and age 7). Great size. Definitely sturdy enough, and easy to hold. I've gone through lots of different brands of plastic cups. These might be my favorite. If I were to change anything about them, I'd maybe make them slightly smaller ... 10 oz maybe ... but the 12 oz size is still great."
"Product was exactly what I imagined it to be. All of the cups were placed inside a large plastic bag, which the outside of the plastic bag looked dirty, however the cups were not damaged. I used these for a large party. Some were filled with veggies, other with fruit, and the rest for drinking out of. They did what I needed them to do. Great quality and quantity for the price I paid. I would order them again for any upcoming parties."
"These cups are as nice as a clear plastic cup can be- we like them better than hard plastic or translucent-good quality; use everyday w “drop ins” . Good for old folks, not too heavy but still keep shape and hold enough."
Great amount of cups for the price. Definitely would not suggest using this for hot drinks as the cups are plastic but they are great for anything cold and fairly durable for regular liquid drinks (no smoothies as I tried and my cups broke). All in all a great deal for 240 cups that go a long way.
I use these cups for many things because they are so inexpensive. I don't have to wash bowls because I mix eggs in these disposable cups to scramble. I poor my Cranraisins it them to eat from because they are so sticky to eat with your hands. Good and inexpensive and cheap enough for a one time use and toss out.
"I was surprisingly pleased with these cups. I don't have a dishwasher & go through an incredible amount of beverages daily in my household. The Solo cups are now 16 ounces, & just too big. These are 12 ounces & really very sturdy. Will definitely purchase again."
"Plastic cups can be very expensive. In my home, the sink is usually filled with glassware at the end of the day. I hate doing dishes and the name brand plastic cups are not a good deal for the price. These cups are sturdy enough for everyday use and special functions. I will purchase them again!"
"When we couldn't get cups anywhere, Comfy got us cups that worked perfect, at a good price and delivered timely!"
These cups are great for the money. I bought quantity of two because they last a long time and do not break down easily either. I highly recommend these for the money and quality
"Perfect fit for my needs and the price was great! I had tried before to buy cheap cups- but these surprised me! Strong, durable. Right size, right number, PERFECT!!! Not washing glasses for a month or more!"
Great durable product ! Excellent value for the price .
nice
I wanted 240 clear plastic cups and this product was delivered promptly and for a great price. No complaints as they got the job done. Would order again without reservation.
"These have to be the best plastic cups I have ever had the pleasure of drinking out of in my life. Would highly recommend. Be careful though, if you turn them upside down the water will come out."
These are the perfect size to offer a cup of water to our patients in the office.
Can't go without them.
I have been getting these quite often.. Whole family likes them! Right size (12 oz) and has tops for the little ones..
They're good for the kids. Not too big and not too small. A bit stronger than I thought so im comfortable with filling it to the top and it will not spill. Like I said its good for the kids. I would definitely get.
Sturdy cups that can be usable. holds up to washing.
Works fine for what I needed.
These were ordered for an outdoor wedding to be used for drinks. I think these be a great safety factor against breakage and damage.
"I like the quality and size of cup..ideal for soft Drinks, water and other Cold beverages."
The 12 oz is more than enough for every day use. They are easy to handle and great for the price
"Plastic cups got them for my son to play with, work fine, they are on a soft side I think, but they are great but for the money!"
I like the clarity and smoothness of the cups
"Ordered these for beer and tea at my wedding. They are good quality, sturdy cups."
Nice cups you can’t go wrong
Smaller cups but good for kids and worth the money
Good quality glasses. We used them for water glasses at my daughters wedding reception. Durable
Great deal and perfect size for my kids. Will by again.
They are sturdy drinking cups for dinner and or party times used at formal events also
Nice. Durable. Affordable. Perfect size.
These are great NOT THIN good price
Great deal for fantastic cups. Not a thin filmy one as you may imagine. I am very happy with this purchase !
work perfectly! sturdy and i love that they are clear. Recommend these!
Product is excellent this is the second time I purchased them.
"Everyday use, the cups are durable I love them and the quantity size is incredible."
"I compared several different deals to this one and found this to be the better out of them all. For the number of cups you receive, this deal has the best price! Also, they arrived earlier than expected! We're using these for our backyard wedding so thanks for helping our dreams come true!"
"Good product, good price and on time shipping"
Sturdy cups. Good buy. Delivered on time. My 2nd order. No longer need to get flimsy ones from grocery store.
Útiles por su durabilidad.

Great size and not flimsy like some plastic cups.
They seem good and had a decent price
Super !!!!!!
Sturdy and nice cups
Durability and Sturdiness 5☆'s
Good price
Nice size cups. Very durable and lasted a long time.
Very strong and great looking for a plastic cup...
"Overall, the cups are a good product. Appreciate that they are easy to separate."
Good quality
"Ordered before, great purchase for the dollar!"
"Very happy with this product,cups, will be ordering more later!"
Perfect size for outdoor eating
I use these for my smaller resin molds. They work great. Durable. Can withstand being heated with a heat gun but will get hit so watch your fingers.
Good Cups Fast Shipping
Works great
"Great price! Item as described by seller. Sturdy, durable and clear plastic cups. Perfect size. Fast shippimg. Will purchase again."

Good cups for what ots for..I'd buy again
Great price
"This is a review of: [240 Pack - 16 oz.] Clear Disposable Plastic Cups These16oz cups are a good value and comparable to other well known brands. I read one review stating these cups were thin; however, that doesn’t apply to the cups I received. I recommend these disposable cups and will order them again. This order was for 240 cups which is $0.11/cup. I think this is an awesome deal. This review was written by LynKin."
I like that the cups are smooth. Cups with indentations make carbonated beverages foam excessively. I like to see what I’m drinking in case something is in the cup that I don’t want to drink so I always use clear cups. A quick rinse with cold water further reduces foaming.
You can see the value but the cups themselves truly are study. Even the rims are extra thick. Being clear you can make an elegant table outdoors with these so as not to worry about glass breaking with people carrying drinks
What's most important to me is that these cups are not flimsy. They should hold any liquid amount without structural failure. I will buy them again.
"These cups are clear and sturdy, not as sturdy as a solo cup, but since you are just going to throw them a way why pay more. These are definitely worth the price."
They may not be crystal clear but with the National shortage on 16oz clear cups these work fine. The only down fall is there is not a lid that fits but I just ordered a cup sealer so that shall work just fine!
Don’t hesitate to buy these cups. Why? Because they great.
Sturdiness and saves time being bulk count.
A lot of cups in the package. Bought for our beer themed wedding. Okay quality! Got the job done. Was able to drink out of them and refill them! If you're looking for a cup that holds liquid and transfers the liquid from the cup to your mouth this is the cup for you!
"We are using for an outdoor event, great quantity package, size and strength. We didn't want the colored cups you get in the stores. Will greatly improved the look of our event. Great price too. Hi"
Thank you for an easy transaction. Perfect
Worth the money.
If you have a lot of little kids around these are great.
They are decent made and should hold up good to use
A nice sturdy cold cup. Great if you have teens who use a lot of cups. They can even be used for ice cream and cold desserts.
"Pretty and good quality, easy to hold."
These are as described
LIKE THEM VERY MUCH---GOOD VALUE.
"A little flimsy, but held up well."
Great cups sturdy clear and a good price
I love the cups when I run out of cups I buy more

Very sturdy glasses. Used these for my daughter's wedding.
"Where are the lids, could not find flat lids???"
good
Great cups
Great cups they don't leak amazing
Cups are not flat on the bottom. Convex shape makes them wobble when set down.
Vert good hard plastic cups. Perfect shape and size. I really enjoyed it and also the other sizes they have.
"Exactly as advertised. No issues with packaging or shipping, no problems."
Like. Sipping.
Exactly what I expected
I'm a bar owner and these are great for busy night when we don't want to wash a bunch of glasses.
Great quality and great price
Love them.
Perfect
Good quality

"I ordered these cups for my office as we go through quite a few in meetings. I read the reviews and liked that these cups were priced $4 less than the pack I normally buy with 40 MORE cups. I compared the descriptions of both cups and decided to give them a try. When I received them, I noticed they were considerably thinner than the cups I normally buy but once I pulled a dozen cups from one stack/sleeve, I realized the quality was considerably poor and the cups were defective. I say the cups were defective because it seems the cups were melted by high heat at one point during (I'm assuming) their manufacture. On the defective cups, the sides were so thin that I was able to poke a hole through them using my finger. I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement which they were kind enough to deliver the next day. Unfortunately, the second pack was the same. I returned the second pack and purchased from the seller I've been buying from all year. I like consistency even if it costs a little more. A lot of the reviews were written by people that used these at weddings, parties, etc. and they seemed to work out fine for them; however, in a nice, professional office setting, I cannot have a client use a cup that's likely to break or leak on them."
"I like that these are actually transparent, rather than translucent like the others I was using but the quality is awful with these. Many were flawed. About 30% of them wobbled like a weeble when you sat them down on a table, due to some defect that gave them rounded bottoms, but these did fall down because when you fill them they are top-heavy. Lots of other flaws too. The packaging was also very inconvenient for filling a dispenser. I will be going back to the translucent cups I was using before and will not order these again."
"Well made, I use them when people come over. But with this virus. Try to keep everyone safe we all use them in the house. Since I don’t have visitors any more. We have to teach our kids this is going to chance our life and theirs nothing will be the same any more. Plastic cups are the was to go/ they are very sturdy."
cups are fine but are running more expensive all the Time. delivery not as promised and twice of delay notice was sent
"I love these little cups! They come in smaller sets at Paper Source and Target, but when you need bulk for a party, this is definitely the more financially sound way to do it! While they aren’t large, they are so lovely that anything from soda to wine, and pre-mixed cocktails (easier at a party than individually mixed cocktails, but those will fit, too - obviously) looks lovely inside these, you totally don’t miss having particularly shaped vessels for your drastically drinking needs! 👏🏻💕💕"
We bought these for use at my daughter's wedding reception. Very cute for plastic. i appreciated a festive option instead of just utilitarian. We had lots of extras and I am enjoying using them for every day disposable use. No leaks. No problems. Just very fun cups.
We ordered square plates that matched these cups. We were very pleased. They held up well and they were just clear enough to allow the lemon water to show through yet the sparkle was still on the outside of the cup. It looked great. We recommend these cups for your event!
These cups are the perfect size. They are sturdy and we are going to use them for a candy bar I am preparing at my son's request for his 40th birthday. They are pretty - too pretty in fact that I'll have trouble trashing them after use.
"Great looking cups, especially for the price. Just be careful not to squeeze to tight, seem to crack that way. Overall wonderful though"
Not one was broken in the box! I grabbed a package of Dixie from Target (off the shelf in the store) and literally half of them were broken. I will be ordering these from now on when we have parties.
These cups were so cute for my backyard wedding. They were sturdy and everyone looked so cute holding these cups instead of a solo or just a plain clear cup. It absolutely brought more festiveness to the evening. They really hold up too they aren't flimsy at all.
I normally just use plain clear cups for beverages but decided to try these out for my annual Christmas cookie exchange. They looked so pretty with my silver and gold theme. A good size if you are serving punch. Nice and sturdy and I have plenty left over for my next event.
"I have ordered these over and over. Functional and beautiful . A little pricey, but well worth it."
Ordered for a baby shower and these cups were great. Nice and sturdy. The colour went well with our colour scheme.
Love these cups! Used them for our xmas party but can use for any occasion Chic and add a touch of glam! Liked them so much I almost didn't want to put them out for the party :) Will be reordering!
Love them
Will be perfect to keep at the bar at our wedding! Got here quick! And 200 cups for a great price! Can not complain!
Worked great for sweet sixteen Mock tail bar & regular drinks too! Glitter looked great!
Used for little dessert cups. SO cute and perfect for what I needed them for. No issues (@ cecesweetsntreats on insta!)
"If you want to have luxurious plastic at your party, buy these amazingly gorgeous and classy glasses. I got the 9 and 12 oz ones. Both are great!!"
Looks great with the drinks in them...just that little extra touch needed instead of the plain see through. Worth the money for sure!
Have not used yet but cups look great
Loved these for my wedding! Gold and not overly girly but a nice touch
The color and sparkles were subtle and just right for a fundraiser - good cocktail size!
Perfect size to serve champagne at a party
These are smaller than Inthiught they would be but very sturdy! But cups for baby shower and they will Work!!
Happy with quality
Perfect for my wedding! Just what I was looking for.
"Pretty study, very cute with our design. We used them for individual shrimp and grits and mini caesar salads."
i bought for my wedding perfect for punch
The classiest plastic cups. Great value and would definitely buy them again.
This is the best value I found for party cups
These cups were great for the price! We used them at my wedding for margaritas and everyone loved them! *No one reported a broken/breaking cup*
Very pretty for a special occasion
All good
I liked them. I wish it had more gold though.
GREAT FOR THE BAR AT OUR PARTY
Nice looking
Color was prefect for my daughter baby shower
It fit in ok for my birthday party
Had an open house for Christmas and the most comments were on this plastic wear! How fun!
Great quality and really pretty.
Great value for the price.
We used these cups for wine glasses at our wedding. They held up well. Would purchase again
Goes with black plates for dinner party. Good buy. Shipping was quick.
Cute cups. Good size for baby shower
Beautiful and well made. Added some glitz to 50th anniversary party!
It was just right
"Awesome looking cups, and sturdy. Purchased for a wedding 👌🏾"
Using them for the bar at my wedding! Very pretty!
Worked well serving wine and other cocktails.
Love the gold glitter. Cups are durable.
If you are purchasing these for the beautiful glitter effect shown in the photos you will be extremely disappointed I took one photo with a black background so you can see the glitter a bit more. As you can see with the cup sitting in a normal setting you don’t see glitter at all.
Haven’t used these cups yet but they came very fast and it’s so many of them
Venían varios quebrados
Ordered and used at my wedding. Worked well and as expected.
"Loved the look of these for our event! The kids seemed to enjoy them more because of the glitter. They were pretty sturdy, none of them came damaged."
"Great quality, nice look..not such a great value for dollar. Smaller than expected."
"These are thinner than I had expected, but worked for our dinner."
"These crack unbelievably easily, chances are your guests will have drinks dribbling all over them all night."
They’re pretty but thin and crack easily.
Very flimsy. Maybe ok for a kids party not for adults. About 10 were broken.
"Perfect size for wine at a wedding, classy and cute"
These glasses were very thin and to flexible for holding in your hands.
"We get these for work, since we have a cooler that does hot water (which means it's almost boiling), and these are great for making cocoa or instant soup or something like that. Holds the heat well without burning your fingers, although I wouldn't hold onto it for more than a few minutes because it's not styrofoam. We go through many of them during the winter for the hot drinks and I don't feel bad throwing them out because they aren't styrofoam. I hate styrofoam because it doesn't break down.  EDIT: Purchasing again in February 2019 because they're still pretty great!"
These are the best coffee cups you can buy and so much cheaper by the case. I love using the Solo lids With them too.
"The cups are a great product. I order the cups June 1, 2022, and still haver not received them. NOT HAPPY!"
I have used these cups for many years .... excellent product
I order these on a regular basis for work and they are extremely sturdy. They work well for hot or cold beverages.
Great for personal use.
"We use them for work and home. It’s the perfect size for k -cup coffees. Dint forget to order lids, too."
Good
The product is all we expected it to be. Used for soda and beer at our canteen at VFW Post 1012
I love how useful these glasses are! They aren’t too fat to hold like larger glasses are. They are just the right size!
The price was right and is was delivered quickly
"To flimsy for drinking out of, waste of money"
Not much else to say
If you are looking for strong sturdy cups you want to buy these. They are wonderful
I personally do not like the color blue as my kitchen is very neutral. The cups shown were brownish in color and would have been perfect in my kitchen. Instead they came in blue and ARE NOT RETURNABLE. Would not use this website again.
"With the kids home, we have been going through the 5 oz cups like crazy, and they are the hardest to find. This was a terrific purchase! The cups are enclosed in 3 separate heavy plastic bags, good for storage (however temporary!) and the design is actually much nicer than I have seen in my retail stores (when available!)."
"I just got them today. Nice leafy design goes with my kitchen decor, sturdy enough. Don't know if I'll have a problem with them leaking, yet, since I haven't tried more than one and I didn't leave it sitting long enough to leak."
These are very sturdy great value for your money they’re durable of course one time use I can leave water sitting in them for a while and they only get soft it’s left overnight my kids have drinking cups that fit my dispenser I’m happy
"Since it is difficult to find the 5oz. size of Dixie Cups in retail stores these days I find that it is very convenient and much cheaper to purchase the cups in bulk from Amazon. The cups are shipped in one package but are divided into packaging that is perfect to store them in the rooms where the cups are used (eg. kitchen, outdoor patio, bathrooms)."
I’m glad I ordered these cups. They seemed expensive at first glance but I’ll have them for years with the 450 count.
"We go through alot of these cups in my house so I appreciate being able to buy them by the bulk thru Amazon.The pattern really does not matter to me but just as an fyi, the pattern I got was as pictured online. There were delivered in one big brown box and there was no damage to any of the cups!"
Had to order Dixie 5 oz from Amazon. Mainly because of there sturdiness. my Sams club only carried their brand which are flimsy.
"We use these in the bathrooms and being able to buy in bulk is a big savings. These cups are sturdy, you can reuse them a couple of times before you have to discard them."
5 Ounce Dixie cups. The real thing. I have trouble finding them in our town.
Exactly what I needed
We use these as juice glasses and for medicine dosages
"For use in the bathroom and kitchen - just the right size for taking pills, or a small cup of juice, etc. and the 5 z cups are very difficult to find in the stores."
The colors are nice and they fit my dispenser.
Still the best cups out there.
These cups are bigger than the little cups I had been using. I like them a lot ! Quick delivery!
We use these in the kitchen and they are very sturdy!
"I love these cups and use them for everything from snacks for my granddaughter to using one to carry my pills with me to take in the car as I eat on the run, lol. They are also great for a mouthwash rinse or a drink of water during the night."
well built as all dixie cold cups.
These cups are worth the money. Plenty sturdy and it has been hard to find 5 ounce cups!
We were having a hard time getting Dixie 5 ounce paper cups in the stores so we tried Amazon and these are great and especially since they fit in our dispenser that we had for a long time.
"These are fun sized cups for the bathroom and other similar areas - we purchased a wonderful bathroom set off Etsy and needed Dixie cups - Stegall's Pottery, and these cups fit perfectly."
Seems like we are always out of this in the kitchen/ bathroom. Like the one use cups for daily medications. Home delivery by Amazon is terrific for these necessities of life.
👍
"Not as pictured, but seem like stores around here don't think that 5 oz. paper cups are important? Well, this is the best size for my family and so glad to find these."
"Good price, fast shipping, they hold water - and I got the floral design (and I would have been one of the people who didn't care what they looked like!)"
I have been using these cups for 30+ years.
I have a beautiful holder for 5 oz cups and order these all the time. It's great to have a nice stock of this items as we go through them a lot.
i have the bathroom cup holders and these are what i always buy.
Great Dixie Cups!
Very strong. They don’t fall apart like some cups.
"These cups are great, especially if you have small kids in the home. I have a cup dispenser that I keep close to the fridge, perfect as opposed to washing 10 different cups a day. Love that I could buy a huge bag, saves me from having to buy a box every month."
"Great for clean little cup for mouth rinsing water. Also makes a nice little measuring cup for bleach. fill little more then half and pours out of cup much easer into washer space for bleach, less mess then trying to handle big jug over my clothes."
I liked everything about these cups
450 5-Ounce waxed paper cups Exactly as described.
Arrived in great condition.
Hard to find 5oz paper cups. Sufficient quantity.
Best
"I only received 100 cups, not the full amount and no slip inside to inform me about the rest of the amount."
"That size Dixie cups are hard to find at my grocery store. These came in perfect condition, none smashed!"
"These cups are slightly bigger than standard disposable bathroom cups. But, they are more solid, and seem to hold up longer."
Saves a lot of dirty glasses from the kids in summer also use them to start plant seeds..will be ordering more of course
"As described, did the job I required it to do. Fast shipping."
Exactly what I want
"They are great for mouth wash as well as for having small cups bedside for washing down medicine. Great size, nice design. Great value"
You pour water in the cup and it doesn't leak. They hold up well to about 3-4 uses. They don't leak...that's all anyone should really expect out of a cup.
Great for the kids. They don't drink much at one time. I don't have too many dirty glasses this way.
Good quality dixie cups!
Just the right size for bathroom use. Sturdy construction
great pricing well packaged
Finally found some with wax coating!
Just what we needed for dipping cups and dressing use. Kids love them. Will purchase again.
"Price a little high.was unable to find in Store. So was ok to pay, ."
What can I say? Dixie cups are Dixie cups! Lol. They've always been a good product!
Was needing 5 oz cups and these were perfect.
"definitely lots of cups, didn't need them"
"Have a constant supply of these in our home. I have my orange juice in one every morning, use it for kid's snacks, even as a measuring tool for cereal."
"What can I say, they are Dixie cups. We can never find this size at any of our local stores."
"We use these in the kitchen to save washing glasses all day - just the right size for snacks, taking vitamins,etc. We couldn't find them in our local market consistently and those we did find had awful cartoon charcters!"
Use them to mix paint ...very tough and convenience for craft work
"Received my order in 3 days, no damage. Perfect for my lil ones when thirsty. I only wish I could find the genuine dixie cup holder like I had years ago."
Finding 5oz cups is difficult. 3oz seem to be the thing but they are too small for handy use. Great price.
love them for by daughters Spa water cooler
Great price.
Buy them. Great value.
good
Nice to ind the 5 ounce size of these cups...haven't seen them in our stores and I've looked...only the smaller 3 oz or much larger cups. Just the right size for the bathroom.
"These ""Dixie Cold Cups - 5oz size"" are exactly what I was looking to use when I brush my teeth to rinse my mouth out with."
Great cups for our kitchen cup dispenser.
Nice size cups . Good for bath room. And vacation guests. And picnics. And punch. And kids. And lots of uses.

"It's a good price for a lot of cups. They are your standard foam cups, 8 oz is the perfect size for our workplace needs. They are packaged in sleeves inside the box that are not too large. I'm not sure of the exact quantity of each sleeve. Guessing, I would say 25."
As described
Great for extra drinks between meals
Making slush and freezing. Very durable
yes
Well worth the price. Smooth transaction. Person recommended...
Mostly use these cups to drink coffee and water from. It holds warmth very well and also sturdy enough because of the styrofoam. You won't find a better value anywhere. Overall would definitely buy these again!
Good quality
good product
Exactly as we hoped it would be. We needed cups and they worked like a charm!
Great value for the price
"Fast delivery, the cups are normal just as you might expect"
"what can I say, it's a cup"
All OK
Decent cups for a fair price.
Does what it's supposed to do.
"Classic Styrofoam cups. We have all used them. They are sturdy enough to be held by the clumsiest of us, and dont burn the hand with the hot coffee.  Packaging arrived in good order, had no broken cups."
"Well, there were a few with a hole in them, but not many. Hard to believe that over my 12 years as Hospitality Minister I bought enough Dart cups to serve 60 Thousand church members a hot cup of coffee on Sunday mornings. Cups that held up to tight grips and securely contained steaming hot coffee both Summer and Winter.  The Minister told me it was his job to give the Sermon and my job to keep them awake for it. :-) These strong and durable cups served that purpose. Cost is always an issue with groups that serve large quantities of coffee so look for a good price, but start here."
"Nice container for liquids especially coffee, etc. Really like the lip structure on this cup as opposed to another brand I picked up in the dollar store. Very neat looking and easy to hold. Important for seniors. Reusable in the proper settings and comes in handy for storage of items needed to be refrigerated. Other storage uses I can think of . I like also that it does retain heat well...tho in a cooler room, might have to drink quicker. Use for soups too. Nice portion. Recommend and will purchase again. A few cents more than the dollar store but shipped in quantity to my home quickly and well packaged."
"These are regular Styrofoam cups. Nothing out of the ordinary. I wish they came packaged better. The box was half open and it was very flimsy. Make sure you think what got inside... If the box was sturdier and properly taped, this probably would not happen. The cups are fine but a bit squooshed because of the the box they came in."
nice product for the price!
Do you need cheap styrofoam cups? Then look no further as these cups are the best value for the money. It holds hold and cold drinks really well and the durability is fantastic. All the cups in the box were intact and there are 25*40 cups inside the box which makes it 1000 cups. What's not to like about cups that hold your nice hot or cold drink and not having to wash the cups afterwards?
"Excellent quality foam cups for a great price and free shipping. When I run out of these, I usually end up paying 1.99 for a few pieces at the liquor store near me, and what's worst is that they're the super lightweight, super frail ones... but these cups are the good quality ones, the ones we've all known for many years... not some low-end, lightweight, foam that breaks to the touch.  100% Recommend to anyone."
"Bought a box of these a couple of years ago and people thought i was crazy but if you buy these 50 at a time at wally world or dollar store the price skyrockets over time. Good price, last great in storage. They have plenty of uses and i always have cups for any occasion."
There is nothing to dislike with these cups. They keep coffee warm. We put them inside of regular cups so we don't tip them over when full. Not necessary for some but we are klutzes. We are very old and don't like doing dishes so the cups are great.
This product is wonderful. It is sturdy with no crumbling in your hand. It keeps liquids hot or cold and just the perfect size for the little ones or the older. Please continue to offer at this time of need to prevent spread of covid 19
The box was crushed and quite a few cups were damaged
the cups were what I needed at the time
The cups keep my drinks warm and it doesn’t burn my hands. It just has a funny smell to it
This was a great value. My husband uses them every day.
8oz should of been 10oz
Nice product. I recommend it.
coffee sometimessome bad onescan be in the boxbut most of the time t
Good quality cups for styrofoam and lots of em! Received in a timely fashion too.
Quality
Great little cups for complimentary coffee!
We go to a great many potlucks and have donated cases to different organizations as it helps defray their expenditures. These cups are very sturdy.
Like
Have used several cases and they always are perfect
Great product. Will order again.
I like these cups very much.
"We buy them on a regular basis, work great for us"
"Cups are great , good quality and do there job."

Our meeting groups love these cups.
Great quality
Perfect for daycare snack time!
WORK GOOD
Great value. Best price I found on the internet.
These were a little to flimsy
Box was heavily damaged
Everything went well
Cups arrived on time and are as advertised. I am a repeat customer.
all good
functional and cheap
Perfect for our snowcones! Got here quick!
"The cups were fine but the boxes did arrive very dirty, gritty, and wet in some places. It's been like that every time I've ordered these cups. But the product inside was fine and arrived quickly."
:)
good product only wish it was degradable
Met all my expectations.
"Expensive, but tradeoff for convenience."
Product was damaged. Box it came in was in was shredded.
This purchase went through with no problem and the cups were fine just as advertised.I would buy from them again.
good for the [rice
Great deal product as describe. 5*
Box arrived with slight damage to a few cups. Have used these in the past and will buy again
I'm giving this two stars because the description says that the lids are included and they are not. The cups I have no issue with.
A great value for what you get.
"Value for my money, sturdy compared to cardboard cups."
Good price for quantity
"I use these everyday, perfect size and CAN be reused a few times"
"Great cups and matches or exceeds the fancy name brands. No shame in buying these cups, and saves money too."
These are very sturdy. Never had them leak.
It’s cups.
Good
good value for the money
These are great!
Nice sturdy cups
Overpriced for everyday or party use when you need large amount.
WORKS AS GOOD AS THE NAME BRAND BUT AT A BETTER PRICE
With a house full of kids I am never without these.
just the right size
"These cups are great, I have ordered them before."
Nice red cup
Did What It Was Suppose To Do !
Well priced and saved me a trip to the store. Well worth it.
"Very sturdy, and a much better price than most grocery store cups."
Best ones out there
Good sturdy cups
Good value for this size cup
Just what you'd expect - cups.
Great
trusted and true
"They are strong and leak proof, you can wash them and reuse them"
Great value and quantity for what I paid
A party
Great value price
Very disappointed in this product especially since it's a brand name. Cups were always sticking together. If you could get them unstuck red paint was always left behind in cup. Not to mention several cups had tears in them. Found out the hard way. Would not recommend these cups.
"They’re cups if you want cups. If you want cups for pong, these are slightly taller and narrower than what you’re used to, and very thin so they’re a bit too light"
"Flimsier than SOLO cups, a heavy drink will bend the cup. The value is good just for the amount of cups in the pack I suppose."
I bought these for home use and you can probably find them cheaper elsewhere!
I used for Valentine's day game
These are Glad knockoffs. Not a big deal except they don't go through safety protocols.
"They looked very similar and it was a gool value, However I am so tired of having to separate each cup when I need one. It is just a little inconvinece but I am going back to Solo."
I buy these often. Wish they were more affordable or available in bulk for cheaper.
Says 6 packs on description but its only 1..so its a rip off..10.00 for one pack..ridiculous!!!
Ok overpriced!!!
These can’t be by Glad! They are cheaply made and have a smell. I wouldn’t recommend or buy these ever again!
It looked like used cups!! The plastic sleeve was not sealed and the cups spilled over revealing dirt on the cups. Expensive for used cups
I brought these cups for an event and every last one has black residue inside. It's very unsettling. Will never order again. Not to mention my guest drank from these gross cups how embarrassing.
Many of the cups were fused together and unusable because of the thickness so two cups had to be discarded.
"In the batch I received, too many cups were stuck inside each other for good. It is quite an effort to separate those stuck pairs - impossible without tools in some cases. They are stuffed inside each other so tightly it’s as if they were glued. That’s terrible packaging, unacceptable for a consumer product."
"Arrived wrapped many times around in an absurd amount of packing tape and with a lot of little holes in the bag. Cups exposed at the top. Seems like the back ripped and had holes and so they just wrapped it in a ton of tape to hide this, but obviously that did not work."
"Very thin, Cheaply made."
When this was ordered it said (Pack of 6) at the end of the product description. Only 1 pack came. $10 is more than double what you can get these for anywhere else. This was false advertisement and needs to be made right.
Cheap and can slip out your hands but it is a throw away cup. Probably ok for beer pong.
Incredibly deceptive to put 100 ct pack of 6 and only send 100.
""
"These cups arrived to the house and it looks like I am ready now for a few half barrels to arrive next. After figuring out I did not order them, was not charged for them and could keep them, we decided to try them out. Cups were just a strong and fillable as the red cups with a song about them. We were able to keep a Sharpie around the cups and our friends and family rinsed and reused them all weekend. That made me feel less guilty for using a disposable product. We will keep these around for the summer end up at our cabin where no one wants to do dishes. Not sure if they come in other colors but these would be great for graduation parties too. My son graduates high school this year in his colors happen to be red and black so these will work out perfectly for us. Great cups, great value, don’t hesitate to buy."
N/A
Not as strong as solo cups. They are rather flimsy.
Good
And had lowest price of all similar cups. Saved me a trip to the grocery store.
Pack of 6 is misleading. 100 ct is all this should say!
LOVE these cups … they are convenient and right on budget for my family and I for everyday use….
I HAVE BEEN USING GLAD PRODUCTS AND THIS ITEM IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS...VALUE AND COSTING ARE DECENT AND AFFORDABLE
these cups hold a lot of beverage and re sturdy
Me facilita trabajo y muy buenos
Great product!
It's just what you expect. Great value
"These cups are totally fine but I bought these particular cups because I saw an ornament craft on tik tok and they recommended these exact cups. These did NOT melt as shown, I tried different temps, distance from broiler, even baking on different temps, etc.... they would not melt down right. The cups in the video were more opaque and these are totally clear so maybe she showed the wrong product. Disappointed that I spent money on these for the craft to fail but I will just use the cups to propagate plants."
"I bought these to make ornaments from a TikTok video , you use sharpie’s to draw on them then u bake them for about 25 seconds and they shrink flat kinda like a shrinky dink… works great!"
I use this for resin. They're pretty good and a decent size. I have to use two for all of my moulds but that doesn't bother me. They don't get super hot and aren't flimsy.
"I bought these cups very quickly right before a move and I didn't really read the description. That's on me. Searched amazon for 20oz cups and just added the cheapest thing to my cart. Problem is, 7oz and 20oz are two VERY different things. If you're actually looking for 7oz cups, these are great. They're pretty sturdy and I don't have to fight to get them separated like I have with other plastic cups. HOWEVER! If you're like me and you're looking for regular sized cups, please be aware that these are tiny. Great for shots, less great for trying to chug water while moving furniture on a hot july morning."
Very flimsy. Crushes under pressure of fingers and drink. A pain to separate each cup from one another.
"These 7-oz plastic cups are the perfect size for us. And the clear plastic of the cup is wonderful. We are very happy with our purchase. My only issue is that they are pretty flimsy. Overall, good purchase for us."
I bought these cups for ovulation testing. These are sturdier than some other cups that I have bought for this purpose.
Use it for the bubbler in our house. Kids were always dumping out full glasses now they have just tge right size
"Great plastic cups, very thin but no leaks/breaks. Have used for all types of things, resin, lemonade, water."
I use thes cups in the RV. Perfet for juice or wine. The are sturdy and convenient.
Good
Small like I like them
These worked great for what we needed them for. A+
Loved them would recommend to all! Used for a party were a hit with kids!
I felt that with this virus thing it was good to have disposable glasses for both convenience and safety-thanks for your prompt delivery!
"Are these mildly flimsy? Yes, but I only need them to mix chemicals together for mold making kits, so they were great!"
Your plastic cups are a great value for the price. I would suggest them to friends to buy if needed.
Great for craft projects! Really good for small mixes of acrylic paint and pouring medium.
They are nice plastic cups
I bought these cups for my acrylic painting. They are perfect and inexpensive
This was to keep cups on hand so we don't have to wash dishes. They are great for everything cold. Easy purchase.
"Look good in the bathroom, dont have to worry about colors matching."
These are the perfect size for my water cooler and cup dispenser. They arrived on time and in perfect condition.
Great product for a low price !
value is great useable
I use these for acrylic painting and they do the job perfectly.
Very durable.. was able to do what I needed to do with them. I love that there clear so I can keep up with how much product I'm using. Great amount for the price
I use these cups for my water dispenser and they perfect. They are sturdy and do the job as required.
They fit the dispenser and that’s all I wanted
"Good quality, good price, very practical for everyday use."
These are about 2 inches smaller than a solo cup. Not very thick.
"100 - 7 oz cups, just as ordered. Came in a bubble envelope. No damage."
"Good sturdy cups, great price."
Good cups. Not much else to say.
👍🏻
They are perfect size and presentation. Very good
Purchased to use for paint pouring. Perfect size to mix small batches of paint.
A good price. Very sturdy and I love that they are see through
Good
"Very fast shipping, and good quality product."
"Too small if you’re looking for normal sized cups. More like shot glasses to be honest. I wasn’t too thrilled with them myself, but I guess they’d be great for like a kids party or a cookout environment."
Almost not worth buying to tell you the truth. Quite flimsy and thin plastic.
Great buy!
Great value and price
Drinks
Great value
Vasos livianos y buenos
happy the quality and quantity.
To make Gnome with students in an after school project
Good quality and cheap price
Very courteous!! This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
"I ordered them for my office when our water company forgot to bring our cups, we’re very satisfied with them."
Good quality disposable cup for bathroom use. Quick delivery
Order came in quicker than expected good quality. Thanks
shipped promptly
The cups came fast and were a great price for the quantity!
Great for baby shower
As expected
Control size
Great value
"I purchased the cups to prepare layered jello shots, red, white, and blue for July 4th. Worked great the cups are clear so the colors were visible and the sides are flexible enough to squeeze the shots out. I would definitely purchase again."
"Fortunately I only bought these to use in the bathroom for mouthwash and rinsing after brushing, and they barely work for that. Just a warning,....I would not even consider getting these for drink glasses for a party or anything close. They are so thin that only mild hand pressure causes them to collapse. I will use them up for my purpose, but will never purchase them again."
Not as pictured. I ordered these because the picture shows no ridges on walls of the cup. I want cups that are mostly smooth walled. These are pictured as mostly smooth but are ridged. Won't order again for my needs. They may be fine for regular use.
I bought these to put epoxy in to use Stone Coat countertop refinisher. These cups are sturdy and well exceeded expectations. When the need arises I will purchase them again. I plan to use them with paint for stenciling. Great product guys /gals. Thank you
I bought these to use to mix paints for Acrylic fluid art workshops. Haven't yet used them but they appear to be a bit thinner than the 9oz cups I've used in the past. I will reserve judgment on the sturdimess and durability and hope they work since bought 320 of them!
"As others here point out, these are very thin cups. You can very easily accidentally squeeze the liquid right out with a normal grip. They are not very useful. I would avoid these and buy another brand."
These are perfect size cups for my resin color crafts. Love them and will reorder
The top edges where you drink from are sharp! I like the size.
"While these look a lot like a solo type cup, they are very thin plastic and are anything but rigid. They are certainly disposable - a one use and throw away cup."
Works great for drinking out of and easy to dispose of! No leaks! No mess!
Great classic product
I thought these would be like the red cups from costco! What a disappointment! They leak if you look at them . I had ice water in one in the well of a lounger I was sitting in. Water steered leaking everywhere! Pure junk ! Very disappointed !
The first time I purchased this item I had no problems. This is the second time and they stick together almost as if they were glued. Very inconvient!
Great for when you don't want to wash a cup!
Exactly what was ordered
Please Make Some changes in the size so it can fit in any cup holder like Thinner and Taller
All good ‘. No issues.
"At first thought was good deal, but got it incorrect on math"
I’ve bought my share of disposable 9oz cups because I always have some in my kitchen. I avoid dishes as much as possible. With that being said I have ordered different brands through the years comparing pricing and quality. These are by far the best ones and you can’t beat the price!! BUY THESE!! You’re welcome!
""
Perfect for just a sip of water! Use them for my patients on fluid restriction
These are great for the price. I would definitely purchase again. Pretty sturdy as we actually used them to serve ribs in for a bbq competition. Good value and arrived quickly.
"Get the job done for temp use, when we're unable to use actual glass cups ."
"This product features 5.5oz. cups with lids. The cups are fine ,however ,the lids for the cups do not fit. The company should discontinue selling this product until the manufacturer corrects this problem. If you are looking for cups alone, they are fine but perhaps at a lesser price."
They came on time and we're the perfect size. l cannot always judge volume well from a description. Just what I was looking for ☺️
Great for the water cooler … great for using as snack cups. Sturdy and strong as advertised.
These are nice and sturdy
"Strong clear disposable cups, they do the job!"
Sturdy and not easy to crack
I use these cups in my kitchen and it helps save money from the bubble water
Perfect size great price for quantity
Good for everyday use
Good and clean cups.
More robust
This was what I expected it to be
Good deal!
"I love these cups, perfect for any event. Cant beat the deal"
Good price
Cups are sturdy and as described
Great for wine.
Love these cups!!! :-D I use several a day for drinks.
Good product for price
Works perfect for shots
Exactly what I needed!
Great buy
Exactly what I ordered. Fast delivery.
Good quality cups.
"Love this cups for the bathroom, seeding for gardening, tot size"
Great
Loved these for my kids
I bought these because the ones I previously bought were not available. These are too squishy and stick together making them impossible to use in our cup dispenser. They stick together due to the nature of the material and come out of dispenser in stacks of 4 or 5 at a time. Even when not in the dispenser it is difficult to get one at a time from the stack without touching the remaining cups. And I don't want other people's hands on the clean cups.
"They weren’t very sturdy, but I was still able to use them for juice. Great value though"
These cups were an excellent value for clear plastic cups that are not terribly strong.
"We ended up using these just for the bar at our wedding because they were quite small. My fault for not considering the size of cup (only 9 oz, so 1 more oz than a cup 🤦🏾‍♀️)."
Comes in handy for shots I would recommend if your 21+ and looking for some shot cups just for fun lol
These cups are not 9 ounce. They are barely 8 ounce. It’s still a good price for 8 ounce but they are not 9 ounce even though they say 9 ounce on the box.
Received in time. But all were bend. Couldn’t stand at all. My kids used some otherwise I would return them.
Están muy pequenos
Cups have almost no lateral strength and bend inward when held. Not suitable for our use.
overpriced poor quality
"Very cheap feelings, some were cracked already."
These are the answer to you looking for something that just works! They are the right size and work better that the paper ones that just don't hold up.
Return customers shud get some sort if discount
Great value for the money
Great size for everyday use and for parties. Good value for the money.
It’s not as good as expected. The sides of the cup are sharp and will scratch your fingers.
I was very surprised at how nice and clear as well as sturdy these cups are. I almost did not purchase as it said for samples making me think of the 3oz. or smaller. The best price for this 5 oz. cup was through Amazon and I am not all all disappointed with these cups. They will not fit in a dispenser as the lip of the cup is a little larger. I plan on purchasing more.
Good value for the money
These are great especially when there are alot of people in your house and you really hate doing dishes😬
There's almost nothing wrong with the cups its just that there made out of easy to break plastic
These are very sturdy and durable. I use these for mixing epoxy and they are perfect. They don’t break down or anything. So much for your money. Will buy again.
Good for the price
"Listing said holds 14 oz. Actually, they barely hold 12 oz. Not good, unless you want an 11 - 12 oz. cup!"
By far the best alternative to plastic kids cups. Easy to wash and easy for little kids to use for drinking. Cute design and nice colours!
Padrisimos y super detalle la carita en la base
Realmente resistentes y los colores son muy lindos.
"I purchased these cups for two reasons. First, I have grandkids that seem to go through many, many cups. These cups are perfect for small sips of a drink (they hold 8 oz). I have tried plastic cups but they are terrible for the environment and glasses get broken. Second, I do acrylic pour painting. These cups work out great. They are a nice size for my paints, are bendable when I need to make a spout for pouring, and are disposable when empty and dry. Cost for this suits my pocketbook. If I used reusable containers for my paints, I run into another environment problem when I wash those containers."
"These white 8 oz paper cups are perfect for our needs. We use them throughout the home in different areas and in various ways; For drinks, arts and crafts, scooping, DIY products, and measuring other items. The cups have stood the test for each occasion. We definitely recommend this brand."
""
"We were looking for a replacement for styrofoam cups and these worked well. I tried some heavier cups, but these work just as well and are more economical."
They do the job. less dished for me. I use for hot and cold liquid
"Excellent product, same as the description and photo"
These were used for a retirement party for our priest.
Works out good for our coffee hour
Good quality! Doesn’t leak if you leave water in it overnight.
The cups works well. My family enjoyed the small one time use cup. It was good to contain some oil or water during cooking.
Good study paper cup can hold hot or cold beverages. These are thick and feel comparable to a Starbucks cup.
The quality and quantity of these cups is great for the price I paid for them. They seem sturdy and will work great for some upcoming events I am hosting.
"Happy to find these. For some reason, paper cups are rare in stores? These arrive compactly and work well for coffeetime. Definitely prefer over styrofoam."
They’re good cups but I would also recommend coffee sleeves
Just right.
"Excellent choice for a disposable cup that doesn't leak, lasts the whole day, and does not disintegrate. Outside of cup can be easily written on. Retains warmth in hot beverages for a moderate amount of time. Reasonable price for the number of cups."
durable .
These are very good for drinking coffee or anything else
good quality
As described. Arrived promptly.
Good quality cups.
Good for the earth
Loved it
"Sturdy cups, great for my needs. I use them for mixing and pouring acrylic paints. I prefer paper over plastic ones, and these definitely fit the bill."
Great paper cups . This price is a bit high
"Biogradable, great value. Sturdy."
Great white hot cups...I use them at least once a day for hot coffee!!! They are a superb quality for a very reasonable price!!!
Si quieres economisar con un producto de calidad! esta es la mejor option hasta ahora provada por mi!
Works perfectly for me!! You can write on the cups too :)  ĆofFęë time
"Great cups. Good for kids, grandkids, bathroom, kitchen, etc."
"Used for a school party - juice - and, perfect!"
sturdy cup，works well with my morning tea or coffee. pure white without chemical smell，safe use！And good value！
they are ok for disposable. no guilt as with plastic
Sturdy good size quality cup!
I like the cups
"Very sturdy, great for hot or cold beverages."
Worked well for the intended use!
"I’m glad I still had some cups from my first order so that I didn’t think it was just my imagination. I clicked the button, ‘buy again’. My latest order the cups are definitely much thinner and actually flimsy. I use them to heat my creamer in the microwave while my coffee is brewing. After just 30 second in the microwave with 3 ozs of creamer, when I pulled the cup out I have to do so gently and with caution. The sides of the cup want to collapse, the cups are so thin. Of course since the heat transferred to where it’s uncomfortable to hold from the bottom. I’m upset that they reduced their quality so drastically. It’s not the same product I ordered before. When I went to reorder it should have said that product was no longer available because it’s certainly not the same quality."
"These cups are good for grabbing a quick drink of water, OJ, juice, etc., when you don't want to go into the cabinet for a glass. So...they serve their purpose...at least for me. If you leave your drink in the cup for any length of time, the cup starts to 'loosen up'.  Definitely no good for anything hot e.g. coffee or tea"
"These are a good size & strength for every day use. I don’t need to run the dishwasher as often, plus they will biodegrade after use."
I wish they were a little thicker but while they only look fragile. The cups are actually quite strong and a good value for the money.
"...people who were served hot coffee and tea with these cups complained that they were too hot to comfortably handle. If you buy these, expect to double up the cups or be sure to buy sleeves to place over them. For that reason, I won't be buying them again."
Not good for hot coffee. Will not buy again.
We used these for cold water and they worked well. Sturdy and well made cups.
"I would like some heat protective sleeves. I don't need one for each cup, but a few would be nice. Sleeves for larger cups don't fit these smaller cups. The larger sleeves can't easily be cut down to the smaller size, either. Otherwise, I REALLY like the smaller size."
Great in clean cups
"They serve their purpose. But I definitely didn’t get the 8 oz cups I ordered. If they are 6 oz I am lucky. Oh well not worth returning, but won’t order again."
I gave it a 4 start bc they come in plastic besides that they are awesome cups.
Arrived timely. Good value.
"The package arrived and we opened the shipping box to find the protective cellophane was opened at the top. Counting the cups was concerning because there were three cups missing. There were three columns of 49 cups, one cup short in each column. Since the shipping box was not sealed, air was free to circulate into the cups at the open end."
First let me say I did get a refund so the company handled it very well. The bottom of the cup LITERALLY fell out with hot coffee in it and nearly burned the skin right off my hand. Terrible quality and downright dangerous to use with hot liquids. the cups had a strong glue smell- well I guess the glue didn't hold very well. worst cups ever.
I didn't realize how small it was. We had to use two cups b/c it heated up so fast. I thought it was okay for the price.
Basic paper cups for basic 1 time use.
Cups stuck together.
Cup size is very smaller than the competitors but price is not competitive.
Fair cup for the price.
I’ve purchased 8oz cups that are not as small as these. My keurig made an 8oz cup of coffee and it spilled over an oz.
Very disappointed in these cups. They are very small and they smell and taste like paper and chlorine. Very flimsy. I would be embarrassed to serve these at a party.
Stinky smell and weird flavor. Maybe caused by some funky glue?? We are using them to start seeds.
The cups leaked. They were not good quality unfortunately.
"small and made poorly. Falls apart as soon as liquid, especially hot liquid goes in. Don't buy, its not worth the money"
"These cups give off a bad small and even opening the cupboard where we had them stored, the smell permeated. Not a good thing so we have tossed them."
Actually had to throw these out -horrible chemical taste to paper!
"cups very flimsy, debating returning. not for hot beverages at all. dangerous"
Way too thin to hold hot coffee...
Misrepresentation these are NOT coffee cups as stated they are flimsy even with water 🤬🤬🤬🤬
The paper cup does not hold up to liquid staying in for more than a few minutes. Hubby uses them to chug milk at night. I want to sip coffee. These cups are for chuggers.
Threw most of them away. Immediately made the water taste like cardboard.
"Product smelled terrible! My four year old brought an empty cup and said “mommy, it’s rotten!”"
Leaking all over.
"First of all, I’m glad I did NOT listen to the negative reviews. Though these are disposable cups, so far I’m on my second use with one cup! I poor boiled water in the cup and add my tea. I’ve done this yesterday and today with the same cup. NO leaks. NO liquid/tea coming through the cup and damaging the cup. NO cuts or ripping present. NO weaknesses found using this cup for two days. Extremely sturdy and convenient. Do not listen to the negative reviews including their pictures. They must’ve done something for that to happen. The cup also says it is not recommended to microwave, so do not microwave the cup. They probably microwaved the cup and later found it starting to leak. Do not hesitate to buy these unless you want microwaveable cups. If you can do without microwaving, get them! They last long (again, I’m on my second day/second use with one cup). They’re perfect and I love them! :D"
My stepson loves to drink coffee with me. I'm a germophobe and he never wears a mask or does anything to keep from getting COVID. So if I have to be a good stepmom and share a coffee with him I got disposable cups. That way I don't have to deal with drinking out of the same cup as him. I know washing my cups should kill it...I just can't get past that thought. I figure if COVID ends sooner I'll just use the cups to take my coffee on the go. I not one to pay for coffee when I can make it myself. Plus I use almond milk creamer. ;)
"These cups are great for our ""on the go"" lifestyle and there is no worry about leaving it somewhere and losing your favorite cup. It is a large cup and the lid fits very securely, Coffee stays hot for a long time, but the cup itself doesn't get so hot that you can't hold it. I like that it's a little bit textured to eliminate the chance of it slipping out of your hand. It fits nicely in my car's cup holder too."
"Be careful when you purchase, the price on these never stay the same. It ranges from $7.99 - $13.00 .. I don't mind paying more Tham you do at store for these for the convenience of not having to go out everytime I need them plus the grocery stores in my area are always out when I do go shopping, even Wal-Mart. But with that being said I will not pay the $13 for these, that is ridiculous!! They hold up pretty good, can use several times before trashing BUT does not hold iced coffee well at all. The lids fit good also.. But these are the best I've found for the price..  Update 01/22/2022 Now the price is $17.99 from other sellers... I really don't see how Amazon allows such a price increase. I understand inflation but $10 increase on Cups is crazy.."
"We ue these at church & they are just right. The size is perfect. The heat doesn't go through the cup. So they are not hot but easy to hold on to. That's so important, right?"
"For the last several months, the cups are a lighter shade, and are not the same quality as before. They are thin, flimsy at the bottom and at the seams, and leak often. We use takeout cups daily, and it looks like we'll be looking for a new brand."
"After blowing an obscene amount of money on drive-thru coffee, I vowed to start making my own at home after getting gifted a Nespresso machine. These cups are AMAZING and a great size. They are good quality and aesthetically pleasing which is always nice. These are definitely no thermos and won't keep your coffee hot for hours (nor are they designed to) but they reheat beautifully.  Recommend and would buy again!"
Great price for these disposable cups. I like the larger size and take them on my walks with my dog so I don't have to carry a regular cup back home after its empty. Good insulation/quality.
"For several holidays my son would drive in from the city. Would I be able to find a cup and a lid to send him off with coffee on his way back? HAHAHAHAHA! No! So I got really fed up with myself because I had coffee cups, and lids but none of them actually worked together. I bought these, they live happily in the cabinet. Kid will have coffee on his way home and life is good. Buy these. 'Nuff said."
"I've had about 100 fancy stainless steel cups. I've lost about 100 stainless steel cups. These easily solve the problem I seem to have hanging on to fancy stainless steel cups.  Fill it, drink, toss.  They're pretty sturdy, about like you've ever found at any connivence store. Keeps coffee pretty warm for my short commute, and while I'm at work. Usually refill thorough-out the day before throwing away. Could almost say they're reusable."
"To be truthful, I like coffee from a paper cup. Tumblers or pottery type taste different. Also it's sort of a jedi mind trick. I got a Nespresso machine, so these cups put a great coffee into a to go cup. Fooling my thinking, giving a cafe experience. Sturdy cups, the lids give a good seal sound, can be rinsed and reused."
"I like the size and the comfort. Not too tall not too wide, just right. I also like the fact that I can use it all day long. I drink coffee throughout the day and after getting back from her doctor appointment or whatever I just rinse it out and set it by the Keurig. Other cups I could only use once and at best twice before they started falling apart. Works for me quite well."
"These are amazing to go cups for the home. Hub uses them for coffee every am on his way to work and he ever brings them back and I can wash out for a 2nd use. They are strong, sturdy and the heat Dosent penetrate the outside so the cups not hot while your sipping and driving to work! Highly Recommend cups!"
"Tried to save some money and bought a cheaper cup, however quickly found out that not a bargain  These cups are great, the lids stay on tight and cups are sturdy"
I've always purchased this brand in the stores I've always purchased for myself and given to my adult children as gifts. This product is a life saver and money saver also very nice designs . I order from Amazon now thank goodness because you have moments when no one wants to was cups or dishes! THANKS AGAIN
"Got this for our coffee originally, but since I'm not a fan of coffee, I use it for my tea. Perfect small size, easy to carry and keeps our drinks warm for quite awhile."
"My son takes coffee to work everyday & uses these cups for his coffee. They are bigger than normal size, so it is the perfect size for big cup of morning coffee! Will buy these every time."
Better than standard coffee cups. Very nice ergonomic design allows for a good hold and heat isolation prevents your hands from burning from holding a coffee cup that is too hot. This is what a standard disposable coffee cup shoot feel like. Will definitely buy more.
These hot/cold beverage cups are great. A lot of cups are paper now and they burn your hand while holding it. I've had other brands that the lids don't seal well. This and one other brand have been the best.
The cups are great! I use them for my coffee! Easy to hold and the coffee doesn't burn my hands through the cups!
"We keep these on hand because my husband uses them daily. He uses one for a few days, literally until it starts to get soggy, before using a new one. He would often forget where he left his coffee cup and now we don’t have to worry about it! Arrived on time and undamaged."
I love how the lid fits good and snug but they are too pricey for me now
These are perfect to keep on hand at work for visitors who stop by for a cup of coffee. Excellent value!
"I like it all. I’d only recommend selling without lids, S I always have so many lids left Over"
People are going to take it because of the convenience.
I use for my Kcup because just the right size. Makes good to go cup with lid. Be sure is closed all the way around. I buy often.
And great for sending guests home with some coffee for the trip. Handy.
Decent cups for the price. Tend to leak after a few hours.
I keep these at work for when we have someone visiting. Nice to be able to offer coffee in something other than dinky styrofoam cups. Or when I forget my mug in the car...
They are coffee cups. They hold coffee well.
Cups are what the website stated and are worth the money.
"The cups are fine but the lids dont even come close to fitting these cups. Clearly a mismatched set, will use a different seller next time for sure."
"Other cups leak in first use....not these! My husband likes them so much that he will reuse them a second day, if he remembers to bring it back home. Just don't grip them too hard, like my husband sometimes will, as the top will pop off. However, they are worth the money!"
Perfect size and keeps my coffee easy to carry.
"These are sturdier and larger than I expected. I get a good amount of coffee in these, and they are sometimes good for two uses if rinsed out immediately. Pleasantly surprised and pleased with these durable cups."
I like these a lot. Great quality sturdy and feel great on your lips. Not grainy like some recycled cups
Have ordered many times since trying cheaper products that don't come close to the quality of these. Will keep ordering in the future.
We had people staying at our place for a week. They booked us via Airbnb. These are our go to cups and our guests were very happy with our breakfast set up. It was an easy grab and go cup. We use them every time and they are always happy with the quality.
This is perfect so I don't clutter my car with cups from the cabinet.
I use these 3-4 times before tossing. I microwave them too for warm up. No issues at all. Will buy them again.
Great product - definitely keeps your coffee hot. I love these for when I’m in a rush and can’t finish my coffee at home. I just use this cup instead and sip my coffee while I’m on my way.
Most containers like this have to be dbl cupped because you can feel the heat. Cups are sturdy and kept my hot chocolate hot
No car so needed something fast - I will order again if need be.
"I will buy this product again, and it keeps your coffee or tea hot."
"Love this cups, the are totally easy to use all day,"
Coffee on the go from home has saved me more than 300USD a month. I love that it holds and heats my coffee and tea and the occasional Smoothie. These are a staple in our household.
These were thicker cups than expected. The lids fit nice and tight to prevent spilling. We will definitely purchase again.
These cups are absolutely great to take on the go I can make my coffee or my cappuccino at home putting in my cup take it with me saves me a lot of money in the long run
Good quality disposable coffee cups for a fair price. Great for traveling on the go with no hassle of washing dishes.
"Really great and reasonably priced. Sometimes I take coffee to go in the mornings and all my travel mugs are dirty, this is a quick solution. I even sometimes take oatmeal in the mornings in these!"
These cups are durable and great to take on the go
"really love this product, I needed it"
"Strong, sturdy. Holds liquid for long period of time without seeping through."
Very good price and also helpful when on the go or rushing out the house for work in the morning!
Great sturdy cups. Used for cocoa.
To go hot cups are wonderful.
Just what I wanted
Perfect for our coffee bar and to use for takeout will order again
Love our coffee but hate paying big bucks for it so now we make it at home and just bring it with us. These are sturdy and keep it warm and then are easy to toss
"Really good cups, I use them each morning for my coffee. Even when the Coffee is hot, the cups hold up!!!"
love it
These worked great for hot coffee this past winter for plow drivers.
sturdy
Work terrific very sturdy
Use two packs a month and will keep buying these. It’s a great deal and perfect cup.
"Awesome! Larger than the standard dixie version, no leaks, double wall feature keeps your hands from burning."
Love these cups. So quick when your running behind and in a pinch.
Excellent for my coffee. Protects my hands from the heat.
"Hubby recycles covered coffee cups from fast coffee shops, but they do wear out. Now, he has a supply."
I really like these coffee cups but my brother took them need more
Perfect option for our at home business where we offer clients free tea and coffee. Affordable sturdy hot cups in bulk. No lids or sleeves but the cups are thick enough you don’t really need the sleeve to hold it. Highly recommend.
"I'll buy these every time over the overpriced Dixie or Hefty brands. Thick enough so as not to burn your hands, and the best part: no wasteful plastic lids."
"It’s getting hard to find a reasonable price for paper hot drink cups. These arrived in perfect shape in just a few days, right on time."
This cup is sturdy and is good with cold and hot liquids
"Can make several cups of coffee in one cup without leakage,dripage, flaking, etc. all day long. Sturdy. Great Quality."
I have had such a hard time finding sturdy hot paper cups without lids. Thanks for making these!
They were a little smaller than I thought they would be. The lids I had were just a tiny too big for these cups
perfect to use while we are camping. less clean up.
Hold up well with hold and cold drinks without getting soggy.
Will use for church luncheon. Wish they were available in different colors.
Good product and fast delivery
OH My gosh so glad I found these!
"I use these for oats every morning, it is convenient and small."
Title says it all.
Nice!
Perfect for me
These are a great size for use by clients!
Perfect to go cup
Meets my expectations. I have no complaints.
I love no Frills!!
Excellent
What I liked about the leak proof easy to fold and certain this is that you could use the cup more than once some cups you put liquid in it and it starts to seep through these cups don’t do that
These do not leak and they fit under a K cup style coffee maker.
I ordered these for coffee in our office. It's my second time ordering them.
This product was exactly what I bought. I will buy again.
Thanks
These cups are versatile. Indoor and outdoor use. Easy clean up
they are exactly what I wanted.
Me encanto muy buen material y llegó rápido
Nothing to dislike or concerning money
Great priduct
Great coffee cup
Prompt!
"When I opened the manufacturer bag containing the cups, I noticed a very strong chemical odor. The odor does not smell like anything I've ever experienced on a product to be used to hold food. The closest thing that I can think of that smells similar is acetone, or a newly-opened can of acrylic paint. The smell is incredibly strong. I've honestly never had disposible cups with an odor like this before.  Also, the cups leak easily. At the seam along the side of each cup, there are 1-2 thin wisps of sealant material, which flop around and break off easily into your drink and could be easily swallowed.  Because of the above issues, I am concerned that the cups may not be safe to drink from."
"These cups are a nice size but are thin. If using for hot liquids you have to double up to be able to hold the cup without burning your hand. My cups arrived partially crushed due to the thin paper. I would not recommend this for hot beverages, but could be okay for cold drinks"
"Based on many other reviews, I can’t understand why the batch I got was as poor as it was. We had a party last night with about 50 guests and for every person who had a cup of coffee, it took 2 cups. The cups were so thin and flimsy that most every guest was taking 2 cups. I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of these cups I would never buy them again. I encourage you, to purchase something other than these cups if you want a decent cup. Cardboard was flimsy… The heat of the coffee passed right through the cup. Strongly recommend against purchasing these"
10oz cups compared with 12oz cups we have... Cups are okay they work just Not 12oz Cups.  Yep... we actually did Need and Wanted 12oz Cups for The Cappuccinos and Amerimissos we are making.
The cups were okay at first but I had to double them so the 100 turns to 50. But yesterday when I was drinking some tea from one of the cups I felt a small cut on my lip like a microscopic piece of fiberglass. I checked the materials and there should be nothing cutting my lip on a coffee cup. This morning I tried another pair of cups with my coffee only to experience the same lip cutting experience. Drinking should not be hurting me and God forbid I swallowed any of this material. Not sure if this is the “edible film” coating the cups but it cuts like Fiberglass. Right by the seam of the cup. No good for drinking they should not be selling this product. seems like a product liability suit to me.
These cups do not fit to a standard 3.5 lid. They get very very hot and are flimsy. I used them for coffee cups for an event and they were a fail!!
Hard to hold if coffee is very hot Not as strong as other brand’s
worse coffie cup for hot items you can buy
"What garbage! Save your money! Had hot coffee spill all over me because it leaked right through these garbage cups! They should be removed! And should be sued! Btw it happened 3 times , should be banned from selling this crap!"
"Invariably when you get a batch of these, quite a few of them will leak. I got one shipment of 100 that didn’t have one leak but then the next one had at least 25% of them that leaked. Buyer beware."
"You would think that there is no way a company could screw up making paper cups right? Well somehow this company has. Whatever ""glue"" or sealant this company uses at the base of their paper cups must be primarily made of hopes, dreams and prayers. The sealant you have to lick to close envelopes is stronger than the base of these cups. I have used almost 30 of my 100 count cups and am strongly considering throwing the rest out. If you put any liquid in these cups, set the cup down, and return to it a few minutes later, you will find half the liquid has up and left the cup and is now all over the table. They arent even worth the dirt cheap price you pay for them. Screw these, my employees are just gonna get company coffee mugs"
Sent in a huge!!?? Cardboard box
really flimsy when you leave them with liquid in them for any period of time. They did not leak for me
While a good product beware that hot coffee can be a bit of an issue.
a good value. i do need to double up the cups because they get hot
I don't normally leave reviews but I felt the need to do so this time because the quality was so bad. I attempted to try a new type of cup so I wouldn't have to store as much quantity and save some money but unfortunately was left disappointed. Despite being the exact same size and look and material of the cups I usually use the lids I use would not stay on securely so multiple spills have taken place as well as the top of the cup not being sealed properly once liquid touches the cup it starts to fall apart leading to more spilling. I got these for our patients to use at our coffee station in our office so them burning themselves is an issue... Will not be buying again.
"The price is right, but as I poured some lukewarm coffee into it, the bottom of the cup started to collapse and leak. So be warned about that."
"I didn't check the milliliter conversion to ounces before I purchased these, but they are definitely not 12oz cups. Several times when I used our Keurig machine, it would fill right to the brim of the cup when set to 12oz. With 12oz cups I've previously purchased from other vendors, there would still be room for cream to be added. Please consider adding a disclaimer so potential customers don't make the mistake of purchasing the wrong size cups as I did."
They are just fine
"These cups were cheap and they would arrive faster than the ones I usually order for our company, so I decided to give them a try. They are so thin that you burn your hand grabbing your cup of coffee, and after a few minutes they of having liquid in them they turn very soft as if they're about to fall apart. We will not be purchasing again."
"Most 12 oz cups can hold another once or more. Like most Amazon paper products, cups were smaller then expected."
Last order was fine this time over 1/2 leaked
These were less quality than what we expected
sturdy enough for dry items. leak & come apart at the seam with anything wet - even for short periods of time.
"Not all but some cups leak. Unacceptable. Then found a considerably better deal at Costco. Way more cups, same price, name brand. Will not buy again."
Too hot to hold without a sleeve so we just use them for juice
Not sturdy at all. Buy a better one as they collapse easily and don’t hold heat.
Had to throw out all the cups because many leaked. I should have returned them
Some of the cups did leak. I wouldn’t buy them again.
I don't like that any to go cup lids don't fit on these and just pop off as soon as you push down and let go of the lid. You have to buy them with the lids together or you can use then alone without any lids.
The cups are a bit thin.
The coffee cups leak
The cup itself is good but the lid is no good. The whole is too big and when you’re drinking hot liquids you have to wait for it to cool. Because you’re burn your lip.
Pricey
"I expected the package to be brand new, and unopened. It was not. I am returning the cups. As for the product itself, I cannot say either way because the product is being returned."
Cups came with lots of specks of dirt (mold??) in them. I have to wash them to even be able to use them.
hot beverages occasionally leaked through the bottom
"I was a bit skeptical that ant compostable clear plastic cup would successfully handle the job at our big party . . . but they were wonderful. I know they don't compost anywhere near as quickly as paper or cardboard, but I needed clear plastic. . . and these will EVENTUALLY decompose in the landfill . . . unlike plastic which will NEVER decompose. Just don't think you'll be able to turn these into useable organic material in a home composting situation . . .WON'T HAPPEN."
"These actually exceeded my expectations. They are not only bpa free, made from annually renewable resources and recyclable or compostable, but are also a better design shape than any other plastic cups of any type that I've used. They do not knock over easily like most do, there is no strange smell that so many disposables have, they do not crack or even dent with use, they're flexible without being too thin, and they're a perfect size."
"I got them for a birthday party we were having for my daughter. The party was at the park and I wanted to use disposable cups, plates and utensils that were also biodegradable. These fit the bill and worked great! They were very sturdy and lasted the whole 4 hours. My recommendation is to have a marker and have everyone label their cup so there is no confusion on whose cup it is.  Highly recommend them!"
Great for an eco friendly wellness event I hosted.
"We used these cups for an outdoor party and they worked well, held up and I love that they will decompose."
"Great for microwave and doesn't fall apart with food, fill, eat and toss."
Very nice product. Worked well for our baby shower.
I love the fact that I can drink from an eco friendly brand.
"Good all-purpose cup size, I used it to carry cut-up watermelons for a concession food sale. I was happy to pay a bit more to have compostable cups so my concession item will create less trash."
Great size and environmentally friendly
Great alternative to plastic cups. Nice size and good durability.
Worked great for outdoor wedding! Left in the sun and did not see any melting or warping.
"I loved the cups, but be aware: each individual cup is printed on stating that it is a plant-based cup. If you're wanting a plain cup - this is NOT it."
"NIce product, used for holiday party with lots left over for next party. I feel good about using something that is compostable!"
Good cup where recycling was one of the themes of the party.
Worth extra money that these are biodegradable. Great for parties and reduces our overall waste.
Great product. I will definitely buy then again.
"I love the fact that I'm helping the environment by using these cups. What I don't love is that half of them started to lose shape from being outside in the heat. If you're going to use these, keep them in a cool place until you're ready to fill them with cold (not hot or warm) liquid."
Glad this product exists!
These cups are a great replacement for regular old plastic solo cups. Reused them several times too. Will purchase again. :)
"i purchased these cups for a party, and had to run out a day before and pay twice as much for compostable cups at a local store because these arrived damaged. The box was intact, the cups appeared to be melted on the bottoms."
"Love that we can compost these! However, left them outside on the drinks table for a party and the heat (maybe 75 degrees tops) started to melt/warp the cups. Whoops! We'll leave them in the shade next time."
"Cannot tell from photo but these are not plain clear cups, they have a green stripe and lettering."
I ordered these quite a while back and just opened them up to use. The cup bottoms are melted and mishapen and I am unable to use them. It is well past the return date. As you can see the wrapper is undamaged and the cups are all melted!!!???
"These are the best! I used them for a Birthday party and they were perfect - I normally hate buying plastic cups, but in this case, they can be composted! I will never use regular plastic cups again."
These are great for starting out cannabis seedling prior to transfeing them into their permanent pot. You can easily see the growth of the root system so.that you can identify the perfect time to transplant.
This is a stainless steel coffee cup. You can do hot or cold in it. I love the open handle style. This is great to be able to carry around the house or office.  My favorite child gave me this mug. Who does not love that sentiment? Absolutely in love with this. Love the lightweight of the stainless steel. This would be comfortable to use all day long.  This is not safe to use in the dishwasher. It is not to be used in a microwave. Hand wash only.
"This mug was a perfect gift for my mom’s birthday. I have two sisters- I’m right in the middle- so we obviously joke a lot about who is the favorite. I wanted to make sure my mom had a daily reminder of who really was her favorite so this mug checked that box. Everyone got a great laugh out of it. Functionally, it works well. Keeps her coffee or tea warm for hours, the handle is comfortable and the lid is stable."
"Got this for my mom for Mother's Day and she loves it. It arrived nicely packaged so it was ready to gift without much effort, that was a big bonus for me as I am not great at wrapping things. It keeps her coffee warm for hours, comfortable to hold, it seals perfectly, and it is cute... her words! Definitely recommend this travel mug!"
Nice and fancy
A really nice travel mug. I ordered this as a gift for my mother-in-law and she uses it at her computer desk and she loves the lid because her cat likes to push her coffee mug off the desk when she's not paying attention! This coffee mug with lid reduces that issue. It keeps the coffee hot too!
"This is such a great coffee mug for any great mother! It’s design is great for keeping coffee or tea warm or chilled. The color’s are even nicer than the pictures show, it was an excellent choice for a Mother’s Day gift. I would highly recommend!"
Cute gift for special mom. Great for Mother’s Day! Good quality durable. Value for money
I picked for my husbands mom and I think the gift was a highlight. It is small but brings the right message to the mother! It made her smile! I am sure she will use it. It is the right size and pretty handy for a car drive for example!
My mother loved this cup. The design was great and it kept my mom‘s coffee hot and ready to drink by the time she gets to work. I gave it to her as a early mothers day gift! And she loved it!!
I got this mug for my mom for mothers day and she loved it! It is nice and sturdy and keeps her coffee warm in the morning. It's cute and funny making the perfect fun gift!
It's a nice gift for mom but it also holds hot beverages and keeps them hot for a while. You can use it for soup or coffee but my mom is mostly using it for hot chocolate.
My mom drinks a lot of tea - this was a cute little gift. Unfortunately it has no lid so it doesn't actually keep things warm for very long despite being insulated.
"A very fun, funky mug for the best Mom ever! Double walled design, stylish, and has a lid so you can take it on the go! Perfect gift!"
"A very cute mug in a decent size The writing looks like it should hold up to washing, which is always a concern."
Great Mother’s Day gift to stir up chaos at home with your siblings. Highly recommend!
Nice quality and easy to clean.
"In general, it is a good and decent coffee mug. It is nice in appearance and well constructed for an average female. However, I am a male with a few comments. I would like a mug that holds a bit more coffee. The handle is nice, but a bit too short and thin/narrow for my larger male hand. My ring finger barely touches the bottom of the handle, while my baby finger doesn't grip it at all. A last thing is a lid suggestion. I do find it difficult to remove the lid. Being new, I do like the tightness of the silicone ring for leak resistance. However, the little tabs to assist in the lid removal is so small, they're not much help."
Nice cup Lid isn’t as secure as I would prefer for hot beverages prefect height to fit under coffee maker Keurig.
"This mug is great because it has a lid so it won't spill. But rather than a traditional 'to go' cup, it still has a handle.  This is easy to clean and the lid is tight. It's easy to grip. The graphics are bright."
