Did 4 steaks 8oz at one time in this was the best we had. The 12inch was the right size. Easy to clean. The more we use the better the food will taste. Will recommend.
"I bought these for my wife, these are her thoughts. ""My first set of cast iron, easy to maintain, cleans up well and food comes out great! Would recommend"""
I was skeptical on buying these when it showed up on my news feed.. WOW thats all I'm gonna say they are AMAZING!!! I gave my mom one and I kept one she has tried many cast iron pans and she said this is even better than her lodge one she had. Perfect for frying no stick my chicken turned out beautiful. I'm so glad I took the leap and picked these up and they come seasoned also with a care guide book just absolutely worth it. Definitely on my my top 10 MUST HAVE!!!
"I bought this during an Amazon price reduction (55% off). Wow, this cast iron skillet is fantastic. It is very heavy with more than enough room to cook/smoke seafood (such as shrimps and scallops) and vegetables in my pellet smoker. The silicon protector handles that you can put on and take off are a nice feature. Do read all of the instructions and be sure not to wash this skillet and let it air dry. If you do that it will rust. After washing it, then dry the skillet with a kitchen towel."
I moto camp and have been looking for this exact size. No handle for easy packing and stable on a small isobutane stove. I love the versatility and easy care of cast iron. Worth the weight.
I needed a larger size cast iron frypan and I hate buying new ones cause they’re not seasoned yet and it sometimes takes longer to get these seasoned up. But this pan is perfect! It’s so easy to clean and I already have a nice seasoned coating on it after using this about once per week for only about a month.
"8"" skillet with dual stub handles was perfect size to use for fire grilled steaks and veggies in outdoor pizza oven. Cast iron lid great to hold heat while meats rest and when braising stews or baking cobblers. A heated pan sprinkled with a teaspoon of rock salt cooks a great10 ounce steak or 2 large burgers stovetop in minutes. Highly recommend the pan."
"Great cast iron pan. I am very happy with them. As long as you season properly, no issues at all!"
Skillet is heavy. That's good when talking cast iron. Will update review after a few uses.
"This is a heck of a buy! It is heavy duty and makes great burgers and steaks! It comes with a scrapper and also a link to email for another free scrapper. I would buy it again. I am glad I bought this with the cast lid, it will keep your food nice and warm if needed. Read the instructions on cleaning and keeping it in tip top shape."
"PRO's :This was easy to season, and works just great for 2-4 Filet Mignons as well as in the oven for a variety of dishes. 8 inch grease guard works perfect on this Fast delivery -next day  Cons: Handle Pads are only good to 350 df! Bottom a little rough for glass stove tops beware!"
"It's perfect for my biscuits. Also have fried eggs in it. Always make sure skillet is hot prior to adding food. If I do this, I've never had a problem with sticking. Very pleased with this purchase. What a great deal as lid and protective handles were included."
Great to cook with. Heats up evenly and food taste amazing. This was a great deal! Included were thick plastic red handle’s (2) so I don’t burn myself and a pan scraper. I’ve found the plastic handles fit other Lodge pans I have! Very pleased.
"First cook was Jalapeño, Green Onion Cornbread on the 10""; regular cornbread on the 12"" doubled up recipe ingredients. First cook on the 8"" was two egg scramble and 3 eggs overeasy cooked on med low approx 250° no sticking. Bottom oil coated pan, gently worked the edges of the over easy eggs once more white then clear whites, gently slid under the silicone spatula to roll rather than flip the eggs. Love these pans, great investment, highly recommend these pans to those who bake and patient enough to cook perfect low heat eggs. The 10"" baked a can of 8 large butter biscuits perfectly browned bottom, higher rise then with cookie sheet or pizza pan, beautifully stuck together like if they were scratch made. Once you see and taste the difference in your foods you'll know what I mean. Low heat stove top and med heat for frying; medium heat goes 350°-375° on my stove any begining sign of smoke I take the pan off the burner for 1-2 minutes monitoring the temp with a Lazer or probe thermometer. Yup! I love these pans. The lids are great also."
"No more nonstick pans for us…cast iron all the way. Great for stovetop, oven and grill. No handles getting in the way. Nest inside each other for easy storage and no long handles getting in the way. Comes preseasoned and easy to maintain just remember to completely dry them and rub with a little oil to keep them in great condition."
This is a great quality cast iron skillet. Good size and easy to pick up with the two side handles. The top has nubs on the inside to baste whatever you’re cooking. Super happy with this purchase!
'First one we bought had an imperfection. 'Seller quickly took care of that with a replacement. We really like these - - 'bought a second one for our second home. Don
"I love these pots. It cook my food so good. I would recommend these pots to anyone that love cooking in cast iron. The first usei did not have to cook my pots. My food taste delicious anytime I cook meat, eggs or stew in them."
""
These pans like all cast iron require care in cleaning. I cook with cast iron pats all the time and once you learn how too properly care for the clean up is a breeze. I was looking for cast iron pans I can use in my outdoor oven without long handles that are a pain to turn while cooking. These fit the bull. The value is exceptional. As far as heat distribution… they are cast iron and heat evenly as cast iron and carbon steel do.
"I really do like this skillet a lot. I’m almost tempted to buy another one. With proper seasoning, the food tastes delicious!"
Love the price and the red silicone handle pads are a nice touch! I bought two skillets and plan to buy two smaller ones.
It does its job perfectly.
"I have always wanted a cast iron skillet. Works great, a little heavier than I thought it would be."
I seasoned my pans and can cook scrambles eggs without them sticking.
Enjoy baking with this pot. Has a low profile and even heating surface. Love it for corn bread.
Good Quality & fits in my Toaster Oven!..........unlike my other skillets.
"This is a must have, it cleans with no effort, it cooks excellent and evenly. As long as you keep up the Maintenance and keep it well seasoned it will not disappoint."
Awesome products for the price
The fact that this frying pan comes with a well fitting cast iron lid is a true bonus — especially at this price!
I wanted a good cast iron braiser but I wasn’t ready to pay $400. The first thing I tried was beef short ribs with tomato pasta braising gravy. It was fantastic without any metallic taste. I really love this braiser plus the lid fits tight.
Nice size little pan
I liked the depth and handles.
"Got them for a camping trip to cook on the campfire, I’ve only used them a handful of times but so far, they’re great!"
Great skillet. Not too big and not too small. The skillet full of food is heavy so the two handles are a must. Forget the rubber handle covers. Way too hot to use them.
Love the rubber heat guard Handles !! Nice and heavy. Well packaged
Loved it! It is a great pan with a general size for 1-2 people. The depth is good for saute or stew.
Love cast iron but first time I’ve had the rubber handle covers and they’re a win too!
"Used to make Tarka for my dh, worked great."
Cast iron pan very nice quality and works well for the cost.
Good Item
"Well built and priced great. Sturdy, and heat exactly as expected. Versatile and convenient, would highly recommend to my friends and family"
Very happy with the item I received! Highly recommend!
"great weight, great lid fit, great on wood or stove"
"easy to cook in, great heat distribution, easy to clean"
Haven’t got it yet…but I know I will love it… love the double handles..
"Got this today, and it came pre seasoned. It is heavy and durable. Like how deep the skillet is and the two handles in the side are nice, excited to try the rubber handles that fit nicely. Made a huge ribeye in it and it came out fantastic, heat distribution was perfect and it got hot as hell. Can’t wait to use this again"
Great price highly recommend
Haven’t had any issues. Great to cook with.
Great pan. Comes with a scraper I love it.
Solid and heavy great buy for the price. Great for stovetop or oven use.
Absolutely love this cast iron pan with lid!!
"Great pans, Great value"
Love it!!!
Heats well
Very easy to use.
"I've been using this pan for several weeks now and just love it. It goes from stove top to oven, easy to clean and is well made. I won't cook steaks any other way now - just sear, leave in the pan and straight to the oven for a few minutes. Also, have made chicken the same way and it was delicious"
"saw an amazing sale on the 10 and 12 inch pair, wanted to try this shape rather than the long handles. Surprised at how easy it was to use out of the box, just add butter and let it get hot before throwing in food.  I just keep adding butter as I make more meals, haven't had to clean yet... (No need for soap, just steel scrubbie and running water is all I ever need for cast iron, and paper towel dry the extra water) Wish I'd bought a pair for my mom before the price jumped up again.  Also, I expected the silicone handles to be a useless gimmick but they are actually awesome and work really really well (on electric coil stovetop, have not tried on gas flame yet)"
"Cooks perfectly, easy to clean, perfect size for 2 pieces of meat.  I was afraid of keeping it seasoned and not getting it rusty, but seasoning and cleaning is easier and less work than I thought. And the meat is charred on the outside but juicy in the inside"
"The price, design, and little handle mitts are good. However, the inside finish is very pimpled. I have seasoned it by using high temp grapeseed oil and baking it for an hour, Eight separate times, plus frying bacon several times and it is still heavily pimpled. Spend a couple of extra bucks and buy a LODGE and be HAPPY! My personal experience with cast iron. At around age six, I started learning to cook at hunting & fishing camp with my grandfather, using castiron handed down from his grandparents. At age 78, I am still using castiron handed down from Grandpa to me plus a good many pieces I have purchased!"
"This pan takes me back to my mom’s kitchen, heavy and strong. Love the silicone handles, now that’s not something my mom had. The pan is already season that’s a plus. I love that I can go from the top of stove to the oven if needed and the even heat."
They arrived pre-rusted! I was looking forward to getting this set. Much to my disappointment when I opened the box and took product out only to find what is pictured. So now of course I am in doubt of actual real life quality.
I love this set!!!! So easy to clean with the scraper it comes with!! I would definitely recommend to everyone!! Also the silicone hand covers are so great!! Really protects from burns!
The pan weighs too much for senior citizens.
Great deal on these. From stovetop to oven with ease.
"This product more than met my expectations. I used it to prepare pan fried potatoes, and there was absolutely no sticking. It is surprisingly easy to clean. Very good value. This is an excellent skillet for the home cook who wants a large, cast iron pan."
"It is a great pan for baking or frying, heat gets distributed evenly."
I am very pleased with this purchase.
"First thing noticed is the weight it’s lighter than my other cast iron, meaning is not as thick, but still gave it a try, and works great. It came well package."
absolutely great price for 3 cast iron pans . . .but. . . go to youtube Kent Rollins How to Smooth Rough Cast Iron - Remove Pre Seasoning on Cast Iron for Non Stick Cooking . . . . .very simple but well worth the few minutes it takes to get the pans smooth and seasoned . . . please do not cook on these pans until you have smoothed them and then seasoned . . . .then the pans will match the 200$ pans
"This is a great set of pots and pans as long as you take the time to take care of them.  1. Do Not wash them in the dishwasher. (Wash them by hand).  2. Do Not over heat them. (In other words when preheating, don't get distracted and let them just sit empty over high heat).  3. Do Not use metal or abrasive utensils. (Use Wood, Silicone, Plastic).  4. Do Not place HOT pots/pans/lids immediately in a sink with cold water. (let them naturally cool before washing).  If these common sense steps are followed, They will last you a lifetime! If any of these steps are too difficult for you, stick to cast iron or stainless steel pots and pans.  Any product is only as good as how the owner takes care of it!"
"I have owned a lot of cookware and did a lot of research before purchasing this product. If you do not care about using your pots and pans in the oven, this is the best non stick cookware you are going to find under the $700 price point and maybe even at all. This is NOT normal T-Fal cookware, the coating is COMPLETELY different and much more hard. I have owned a few T-Fal Ultimate products for over 7 years and have used metal on them many times, they still look and act brand new.  If you are looking for a premiere set of cookware that isn't for oven cooking, look no further."
"I fell for the good reviews. That was a mistake. My last set of T-Fal lasted 10 years, so I was hopeful. Shipped in a PLAIN BROWN box. I would expect manufacturer packaging, no? This made me doubt authenticity. THREE of the pans did NOT sit flat on my glass top stove straight out of the packaging. Light weight, for sure. Egg pan not in the set. T-Fal -fal quality has gone down the drain. I've already initiated the return. Went out this weekend and bought another set that is better quality and sits FLAT on my stovetop straight from the box. I should have listened to the one-star reviews from the get-go."
"I believe I submitted an initial review shortly after purchase but I'm back almost three years later to tell you these still cook like they're brand new and look like it! Heat distribution is excellent, they're solid quality, they cook food so fast, and they're so easy to clean. I have zero scratches, dents, or chips. No nonstick material is withering, flaking or anything. These are the real deal. Be really cautious about these negative reviews. An honest review holds more weight than one filled with negativity. I cannot believe the price of these versus what you get. These are a STEAL and I would buy a second set in a heartbeat."
"Great product overall. I am very happy with the quality and so far the non-stick feature is working phenomenally. I stuck to the anodized titanium as opposed to the copper like some people got and it works out well and haven't had some of the issues others have. I've always had bad experiences with copper so I just stay away from it. As a warning you MUST use these pots on a medium-high heat; my glass stove top goes up to 10 and I do not use it past 8. I made the mistake of using one of them on high heat and it did not end well, pics attached. It ended up causing some weird markings that I assume is where some of the non-stick layer was burned off. The pot is still non stick surprisingly but the markings remain. The only gripe for me is the strainer pot. Despite my best attempts it developed some water markings right after my 3 use. You will not regret getting these pots. I cook everyday and use almost all the pots minus the very small one I think you use for eggs or something. I kept my old pots, that I had for like 6 years, just in case these were a disaster. Glad to say I threw them away two weeks ago.  The last suggestions I would give, which should be no brainers are: 1. Use wooden spoons to cook and don't use abrasive sponges to clean the pots. 2. Do not use bleach or use it very sparingly. 3. Let the pots cool down for a few mins(approx 20) before you wash them after use, this prevents the warping that plagues some consumers. 4. You don't have to let them sit in water prior to cleaning, everything slides right off."
"These are a great pan out of the box, the problem is that they don't last. My set started to lose it's non-stick and when I sent it back to T-Fal under the the ""Lifetime Warranty"" they returned it untouched, and told me it was a cleaning problem. I then called them and explained that it was only one section on the edge that lost it's non stick, so I didn't believe it was a cleaning problem, they responded by suggesting I buy I new pan!!!! Total waste of money!"
"I am so angry, I could spit nickles. Fry pans are titanium and scratch resistant. None if the pots are! They are junk. Not even same product as the pans, not hard anodized and scratched with a tea spoon used to stir soup! Already discarded boxes so can't return. At 60 I deserve a decent set of pots and pans. @*&%^$@!!!  The bait and switch is really on TFals' part. Their own description does not differentiate the 2 totally different character features of this set. The pots don't even have the T hot spot and surrounding design. They are just solid black and scratch super easy. They sell these as metal utensil safe, they are not. Then in their warranty they say if you use metal utensils the warranty is void."
"I love this set. I searched high and low for an affordable yet tough set of pans that I could use metal utensils on. After weeks (literally) of research I narrowed it down to these and I haven't been disappointed. Now, the indicators IN the pan do somewhat disappear when the pan is ready but not completely which I believe was a complaint. This is minor and doesnt bother me. Other reviewers also complained about warping, chipping, etc. When you unpack these they come with CLEAR instructions on care for longevity so if you aren't nice to them then they wont last. The handles are covered in a soft grip material and stay cool to the touch, the lids have steam holes in them, and they heat very well. The coating on the inside allows to pretty much not even having to use oil and I DO NOT use cooking spray on them either. I saw complaints about the ""double boiler"" or steamer or whatever you wanna call it but it works perfectly every single time to steam vegetables. No complaints here!"
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.  I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.  I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..  Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.  It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???  So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.  UPDATE: As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set."
"Pros: Sturdy. Exceptionally comfortable handles. Not inclined to warp like all the other cheaper pans I've owned (at least, not yet). Even distribution of heat. If well maintained*, exceptionally easy to clean (* - Follow the directions regarding excessive heat. There's no need to ever go above 5 on a 10-step cooking surface)  Notes on the Non-stick surface:  With the regrettable exception of those trendy wrought-iron pans that require a full-time kitchen steward to keep them from rusting, these are the first pans I've yet owned that come with instructions for both seasoning and maintenance. That said, it's well worth the effort. The seasoning and maintenance efforts are miniscule in comparison to the aforementioned culinary primadonnas and the result is a non-stick surface as opposed to the antithesis of a non-stick surface.  Unlike those miracle copper pans in which you can fry an egg without any preparation or oily lubricant and watch the egg slide out onto your plate without the need of a spatula, these pans do requires some oil when frying eggs. However, with a conservative application of natural lubricant (my personal favorite is coconut oil), these pans are amazingly resistant to having food stick to them; both during cooking and clean-up. I've never had to scrub either pan. A simple wash cloth with a light amount of dish soap has them looking essentially new after 2 months of regular use.  Additional Note: Regarding those miracle copper pans, it has been my experience that the neat little trick with the egg works exactly like you see on the late-nite infomercials---once! ...and only once. After that first time, the non-stick aspect of those copper pans steadily decreases to the point that they are about as non-stick as the glass surface of my electric stove-top."
"I'd give these pans 4.7 stars. They are both scratch resistant and incredibly non-stick, do exactly as intended with minor improvements possible.  Let's start with the pros (my roommates have tried everything to destroy these pans): *Plan to leave food out in them for two days? - No problem, washes right off *Plan to stab them with forks while cooking? - No scratches? Whoa. *Plan to forget them in the oven? - They're oven proof, no melted mess today.  The cons: *The cooking indicator light does not work, at least on my electric stove-top. *The outer rim is slightly lower so oil collects there instead of being evenly spread.  All in all, if a bunch of college students can't destroy this pan I'd say it's a worthy & durable purchase. At this rate I plan to be using it a year from now no problem. From our test kitchen, hope you enjoy your new indestructible pans!"
"I was looking for a high-quality non-stick set that can last me a while as I had moved from NY to FL. We had the copper pan set that was gifted to me from my parents, but it wasn't very non-stick or high quality. Enter this hard-anodized t-fal set that was on deal. WOW, what a difference. I'm actually excited to cook food again with a good non-stick set. These pans have lasted through triumphs and fails for our recipe tests and come out just as non-stick as they were the day we bought them. We still use our plastic and bamboo utensils, as I want to preserve the non-stick coating as best as we can. My only issue was it came in a box that wasn't immediately marked as being T-Fal, but after investigating the ship from address I could verify it was authentic."
"Although they are well constructed, I have had the worst sticking problems with these T-Fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick of any fry pans I have ever used. Polish sausage juice burns to a thin carbon that is nearly impossible to get off. Chicken sticks so badly that it rips apart when you try to flip it. Eggs stick and leave a thin layer of burnt crust. These fry pans behave as if they are unoiled bare metal pan. Cleaning is extremely difficult. It takes me 10 minutes of scrubbing with a 3M pad, scraping with a plastic tool and scouring with Baking Soda to get them clean. T-Fal Customer support says the pans must be “seasoned” (lubricated) with hot oil every 10 washes in order for them to have any non-stick characteristics, same as an old fashion unoiled iron skillet, so why are they called non-stick? By the way, I did season them before the first use, and I have only used them 6-8 times. The 15 year old Teflon pans these replaced never required this level of maintenance or had such severe sticking problems. For me, these are a huge disappointment."
"Great Pans, Great Price. Arrived a few days earlier than delivery date. I read the reviews, & directions that come w/pans. Pretty sure they'll last a long time as I do not overheat pans while cooking. I was given a used one a few years back, & have passed it on to my daughter in law. Long life on these pans. Worth every Dollar!"
"Another reviewer mentioned the cookware came in a plain brown box. So when mine arrived in a plain brown box, I was skeptical. But the box also had an official T-Fal owners manual and the warranty. Although it's a little light for my preference, this is great cookware. For those with pans with scorched bottoms, the manual clearly says medium heat. The heat distribution is so good, medium heat is plenty. I really like the vented lids with handles that aren't too hot to pick up bare handed. Clean up is very easy. Also, I've used every pan in the set and all of the pans lay flat on my stove top. I'm older and learning from my past experience with nonstick cookware and these days my mantra is medium heat and save nonstick cooking spray for bakeware"
"I just bought another set of 10"" & 12"" for backups, to the set I just brought into service. They are a good value at; $20.00 to $25.00 a piece. The 12"" in the pictures saw every day use for two years. I have a full set of Calphalon pans, and after 6, or 7 years; the fry pans were done, but like all good cookware sets; the rest of the pots were like new. I use only silicone utensils. When I tried to get replacements; They were no longer in production, and I only found one opportunist selling a 12"" for over $100.00 on Ebay, so to prolong my set; I found ""TITANIUM""! The Calphalons are ""still kicking""! Going on 10 years, with new life, from T-Fal! I was hoping to get 3 years from T-Fal; But as you can see; The titanium is not embedded on the pan, with the non-stick, filling in the rest; they are actually a sort of metal paint job. Oh well! IMHO; If you pay more than $50 for a set of these, you'd do well to research a better pan. They are not worth more. They ""are"" a good pan, but they shouldn't be selling for $83.00 for an 8"" and 10"" set, from a seller on Walmart's site. Thanks for the ""fair"" $42.99 price Jeff!"
"I have been researching replacement cookware for a long time and always found myself unsure of what to buy. I am not a home chef or even someone who cooks a great deal, but I did want something that was non-stick and non-toxic. All the major brands were expensive and reviewers seemed to fall out of love with them after a while or at least find a few disappointments right off the bat. And then I found these (here the angels singing in the background)? All I can say is what a find! Now keep in mind, as I said, I do not cook a lot or even every day. But I have had these for several weeks and really do love them. I have used the small fry pan for eggs, the small pot for oatmeal, the middle pan for pancakes and the larger pot for pasta.  Pros: 1. Came beautifully and carefully packed. Two pans had small scratches on the lip of the pan (not a cooking surface) and one lid had a tiny ping in the lip where it closes on the pan. But non of this affects the cooking at all. 2. They a good looking. 3. They are very non stick. I make eggs almost every day with just a spray of EVOO and they are amazing. (I don’t use the kind that has propellant in it or any added ingredients. Just straight olive oil or avocado oil). 4. They heat up quickly (and do follow the directions…do not crank the heat up to high to heat them). These are for low, medium and med-high heat cooking. And you don’t need to use the high heat. Just start on medium and they heat quickly. 5. Clean up is a dream. I do not put these in the dishwasher. I hand wash and it is a breeze to do. I use a tiny bit of dish soap and a scrub daddy. Very easy. TIP: Don’t put the pan in the sink with water right after you turn off the heat. Allow the pan to cool on the stove before washing.  Cons: The only complaint I think someone might have is that they are very light weight. I love this feature as my other pans were really heavy and I hated that. But someone who has used heavier cookware may think these to be low quality or cheap or not durable. And who knows? If you are hard on the cookware, maybe these would not hold up. But for me, they are perfect.  I hope this helps. Good luck!"
"I have been using this set of pots and pans for over a year now and I am still very happy with them. There are so many choices out there that it was hard to make a decision when I was in the market for a new set. This set met my needs because of the wide variety of pieces included. It includes not only several sizes of frying pans, but also several sizes of sauce pans and a nice stock pot. The one thing I could sometimes use that it does not include is an extra stockpot. There are just times when two are needed for a large meal, but I don't think any of the sets I looked at contain two stockpots.  One feature that is really nice with this set is that they are very easy to clean. Nothing seems to stick to them. I have burnt rice and it peeled right off the bottom of the sauce pan. I have cooked caramel, forgotten the leftovers in the pot and come back the next day to a hard, sticky mess and it cleaned right off with just soap and warm water. This is huge!  Another positive is that they really do not seem to get scratched. I am very careful with the utensils I use, mostly using wooden spoons or silicon, but every once in a while, a kid comes along with a metal spoon and scrapes the bottom to get the food and my pots have no scratches or marks.  The handles stay cool while cooking in most cases. The lids are all clear so you can see what's cooking inside. They do have a little steam hole in each lid which is sometimes good and sometimes not so good, but we have managed quite fine. The lids have stay cool handles too.  I really like this set and would recommend it for family use. (This is my HONEST opinion. I was NOT paid nor compensated for this review in any way.)"
"I've waited 2 years to write my review. I must say that to this day my pans still look and work like new!! I am very impressed! I cannot think of a single problem that I've had.... I love the stove to oven versatility. They clean up easily, and considering I don't have a dishwasher, I'm glad that they do. Take care of your pots and pans, and they'll take care of you!"
"So far so good. This has been my favorite set from T-Fal so far. We had older sets that just needed to be replaced and this was definitely a good buy. The pans have a very slick coating that seems to hold up well and haven’t had any scratches. Mine tend to have bacon, beer, steaks and eggs on the regular, and whatever else I can cook up on a drunken late night before bed, and they haven’t failed me yet."
"I originally purchased the 12"" pan at the end of 2017 and it lasted until September of this year. The pan had a great coating and was very non-stick for about a year and a half. At that point, it started to stick just slightly. I noticed it with things like fried eggs where it became slightly more difficult to flip food without some sticking. One thing that did bother me with the pan was that it warped very early on. I left my electric stove on high heat when I was trying to get it warmed up quickly and forgot about it for a couple of minutes. When I came back the pan was no longer flat. In the description they state that the base is warp resistant, but only up to a point. So since i have a glass top stove it was annoying from that point on dealing with a curved bottom pan where food would always drift to one side of the pan.  Overall though it's a great pan, and it lasted for about as long as I thought it would. I ordered new ones since the coating started to deteriorate at the heat indicator spot in the middle of the pan and I didn't want the coating to be in my food. I've used the pan in the oven and it does just fine. It's a pretty sturdy pan with a thicker bottom than a cheap pan you'd find at the store. I have pictures of the new ones I got compared to the one that lasted just under 2 years.  To summarize:  > Pros - Great non-stick coating makes cooking easy - Good price for the quality of pan - Sturdy bottom holds heat well and distributes heat evenly. - Oven safe  > Cons - Pan became warped and didn't sit flat on my stovetop. - Coating wore out and started to flake at the heat indicator spot - Handle started to become loose with no way to tighten"

"Phenomenal professional-grade cookware that is so easy to clean! This set is excellent. I augmented it with the 5qt jumbo cooker for bigger dishes that need a higher side than the big frying pan. I’m an amateur chef and use this cookware every day. It’s the best cookware I’ve ever owned, even though I’ve had more expensive professional sets from Calphalon and Germany.  I use only silicone cooking implements to prevent scratching. Wash it by hand with Dawn, not in the dishwasher, and it won’t fail you. I have had zero problems with fit or finish. My set was flat on the bottom unlike those of some other reviewers. Like other cookware sets, it is raised slightly in the middle so just swish around the butter or oil if you are using any. They heat up fast and cool down fast. When you’re done, leave it on the stove to cool before putting water in it to clean.  This set stacks well and economically in my pullout shelves. Even the 5qt jumbo cooker fits between the big frying pan and the next piece. The rubber handles are excellent and stay cool to the touch. They also help keep the biggest glass lid from sliding around when I place it on top of the cookware for storage.  This cookware is an excellent deal!"
"I absolutely love this whole set! No issues. I thoroughly read all the material that came with the set in the box and it's all held true this far. I've had this set for a few months but didn't want to post until I got experience under my belt using the set.  I use the correct size pot or pan on the correct size burner, I don't ever use high heat on any of them (I don't exceed medium heat), no oil of any kind is necessary but I still use olive oil for health benefits, I only use silicone utensils with my T-Fal set so it never ever gets scratched, (I purchased a silicone carousel utensils set separately that matches T-Fal set), I always gently hand wash with gentle side of sponge (never hard side) and never put in dishwasher, and I let the pots and pans cool off when hot before immersing them into water in sink.  I highly recommend this set. All my lids work great, the handles on pots and pans don't get overheated, and food even tastes better because of the high quality of the pots and pans. Every meal I make seems to taste better in these.  I was really nervous about investing in this expensive set out of fear of being disappointed, but I've been nothing but happy with it. Respect the set and actually take the time to read the directions and you'll find joy in cooking with them. Purchase, read, and enjoy!!!"
"This set is fantastic. I have a hard time understanding any of the negative reviews. It’s just a great set. Easy cleanup, perfect cooking and just an attractive set to display. Read the directions, don’t use the scratchy side of the sponge, don’t put in the dishwasher because that wears them down slowly. After reading the directions I found that the red dot in the middle will go completely red when it’s at the optimal cooking temperature. Great technology. Just respect the pans, use the right utensils and clean them gently. I was using cast-iron but it’s just a lot of work. Convenience is king. Very, very happy with this set."
"I rated these 5-stars. My rating criteria was:  1. The product met or exceeded my price expectation. I thought the price was super competitive when I bought these in 2021.  2. The product met or exceeded my quality expecting. So far so good. They heat up nice and evenly. No hot and cold spots discovered so far. They are remarkably lightweight, which is nice. I feared the thin body might affect performance but it does not seem too. I have been using for three months now. MAYBE they aren't restaurant quality or something, but they are way better than my old set of the same make.  3. The product met or exceeded my performance expectations. Bottom line is after 3 months of daily use, J am the family cook, I really like these. They clean up great. Non-stick surface is all that. Just wipes clean. The steamer insert is super nice and not expected.  4. The delivery met or exceeded expecting. They arrived the next day I think. Stupid quick."
"I bought this set about a month before Prime days, and wish I'd waited since it went on sale for a substantially lower price. Bummer. That said, I really like the set. The ""griddle"" pan is great for frying bacon, and the little egg skillet is perfect for frying up a single egg. All the other pieces are very functional. The non-stick coating works exceptionally well on all the pieces. The ""heat circle"" which turns red when the skillet is properly heated up is a nice, unique feature. One little negative is the fact that there is no lid for the medium-sized frying pan. It's odd because there are two of the same size to fit other pans, so one might suspect they could have made one just slightly larger for the frying pan. All in all, a good, versatile set for everyday use. Recommended!"
"We recently replaced all of our old cookware with this T-Fal ultimate hard anodized Titanium set. It's fantastic! Cooks great, super easy to clean, handles stay cool. Because it's so easy to clean, I only hand wash as dishwasher detergents & rinse aids can affect even the best non-stick surfaces over time. I also don't use metal utensils even though it says you can. One great feature I haven't seen mentioned in the description is that the handle rivets are also non-stick coated. This was a welcome surprise when the set arrived. I did a lot of research before buying & had even purchased a different brand highly rated, very expensive set, but it arrived damaged, so back it went asap. The quality of this T-Fal set is just as good as the expensive set & much easier to use. Very happy with it."
"I have used this set for a couple of months now, and I have been very pleased with every aspect. I specifically chose this set because of the 3 sizes of saucepans in it. Heat distribution is great, non stick finish and exterior is like new. Yes, I put it all in the dishwasher. No, I don’t expect it to last forever. I passed along my older set of tfal to a friend and it’s still cooking fine, just looking a little aged (just like me lol). When it’s time to replace this set I will go with tfal again. You won’t get hurt at this price even if just a couple of years, but I got 7 out of the last set."
This is a nice large set of pots and pans. Excellent value for the price paid. Nice anodized exterior Only complaint is that the 10.5 inch frying pan doesn’t have a lid. I ordered a genetic lid from Amazon. I cook on an electric stove so the heat distribution is fairly even. I always use silicone or plastic utensils so scratching is not an issue. Nice non stick finish.
"Cookware sets vary quite a bit by the weight of the pieces, what pieces are included in the set, etc. I researched online for months before deciding on this particular set. I was so happy with the first set of this T-Fal cookware that I bought, that I bought a SECOND set just so I'd have it available a few years down the road when my first set starts to show wear. The pots and pans are fairly lightweight compared to some cookware types (important for people who are a little older and/or have arthritis) and are easy to clean, and this set contains all the pieces I would ever use. I didn't think I'd use the steamer insert, but I've actually used it multiple times and find it nice for steaming vegetables."
"Esta batería de ollas está recomendada al ciento por mi. Obtuve un juego anterior que aún con 9 anos y su cuidado Lucian como nuevos. Se me ocurrió la idea de que la marca famosa de stailess steel era mejor lo cambie. Y que decepción se quemaba o se pegaban las cosas. Pues dije porque? Quien me mandó? Y regrese a mi gran marca Tfall este equipo trae exacto lo que necesitas para tu cocina. Tamaños buenos de muy excelente material. Cocinas rápido, no quema nada y no pega nada. Es facil de limpia siempre y cuando uses esponjas y panos adecuados ( por favor no estregues con brillos, ni cosas afiladas) pues podrás danarlos y tendrías que eliminarlos porque si se le sale la capa peligras, podrías pasar tóxicos a tu cuerpo. Utiliza cucharones de goma o madera nada de metales. Esto lo rallaria. Tfall tiene unos muy buenos. Otra, son fáciles de limpiar, guardar y cuidar. Soy práctica y minimalista solo tengo este juego, me es suficiente excepto una gran olla sopera de Tfall sería un éxito para completar. Lo recomiendo a todos lo que deseen comenzar y durar con un buen equipo en tu cocina. Las tapas son en cristal para no destapar a cada momento, evita la perdida de vapor , contiene su valvulita de escape muy segura así es mejor para ver cómo va todo. Estoy segura que ahorras tiempo, dinero y energía con esta batería, Compra de oro para mí. Si deseas un buen ánimo y amor por cocinar este sería tu equipo. Y de precios excelente y ahorras mucho, evitas el tener que salir corriendo a buscar otra olla porque? Estás completa y te aseguro no te descepcinaras."
I am submitting this review after a month of use on a gas stove. This was a reasonable priced cookware set. It cooks evenly. The T-Fal Red Spot is a gimmick. The spot does not change in color to indicate pot/pan readiness. It is very easy to clean. No scrubbing necessary. Simply wash in soapy warm water and dry. Pot/pans are not too heavy or too light but have a nice weight to them. Ergonomical designed handles makes for easier maneuvering. The handles remain cool during cooking process which is plus. Lids are see through with steam release opening. This great because you don't have steam hitting in the face. The only thing that would make this the perfect set is if they had more of a stackable design and if the lids had built-in strainers. I would definitely refer this set to cooks who may not be able to afford higher end cookware.
"Going from six year old pans that stick to these are an obvious upgrade, but these pans are better than my old ones when they were new. Previous set was also T-Fal, but cheaper.  So far, I like everything in this set more than any other cookware set I’ve used. The heat distribution is great, everything sautés, boils or fries very nicely. I’ve even use shallow oil in the pans to fry up panko breaded chicken to a beautiful crisp.  Two things I like a lot more than cheaper cookware are that the handles are riveted and the handle material is much more heat resistant. I no longer have to get a flat head screwdriver or star shaped screwdriver to tighten the handle because it got loose. The handle has a rubbery material on it was well that grips nicely and does not hold heat. It’s very helpful when all the burners are being used.  Overall, for the price point, this is a nice set of cookware. My last set lasted for six years, hopefully I’ll get ten years out of this if I treat it well."
"My wife bought these based on the TFal name. And after a household of 7 wearing out department-store fry pans every other month or so. Well, we all love these pans! Heat distribution is awesome... and no doubt as long as no one uses metal utensils in the pan, the coating will last forever. We have had ours for over 8 months and they look as good as when she took them out of the box. So loved, that when a son moved into his very first home, she bought him a set as well. And that it is a 2-pack of different sizes is wonderful HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR DURABILITY, HEAT DISTRIBUTION, CLEAN UP and VALUE!"
"I’ve had this set for about 6 months now and they’re your average cooking pots and pans. They do their job well. I did have one problem with the small pan though. I cooked an egg without oil since they’re nonstick but the egg got stuck. It left a burn mark on the pan and even after washing it a few times, the burn mark was still there which made other eggs get stuck in the same spot. I don’t know if uneven heat distribution played a role but that was my experience with the small pan. The pan still does its job and the size is perfect for smaller portions of whatever you want to cook. I haven’t had any problems with the other pots or pans. No scratches yet on them either but that might be because I use silicone spoons and spatulas.  (The burn mark eventually came off after soaking in Dawn Platinum Powerwash)"
"I had bought a 2 piece set (8"" & 10"") several years ago, and I wanted another 10"" and a 12"" frying pan. I saw this set and thought I would check the reviews. I always check the reviews before I purchase a product. I was amazed at the negative reviews. I absolutely love these pans and am baffled why people have issues with these. The first set I bought is just as good as the day I bought them. I do use them daily and they are washed in the dishwasher. They heat evenly, clean easy and easy to use. Of course I DON'T use metal utensils in them and I honestly didn't know that they could be used in the oven. Good to know, though. I HIGHLY recommend these pans to anyone that is in need of frying pans."
"I bought these to replace my mom's entire set since they were getting pretty old and beat up. We've only been using them for less than a month but they've been absolutely wonderful so far. We're still getting used to the way they cook, the instructions say not to use them on high, so it's been a bit of a learning curve in trying to figure out how to change up the way we cook. Mom forgot the first time she used them and the food she was cooking cooked lightning fast and not in a good way. I think it has something to do with the material heating up quicker? So putting them too high makes it harder to judge and all. That was more our fault than the set's of course.  Overall I'd say they do a pretty dang good job, and so long as you don't put them on too high it's pretty easy to measure the cooking temperature without it going too crazy. Cleaning them has been a breeze. I was worried the first time I made something and saw it sticking to the side, but even after leaving them out for a night or a few hours after cooking everything came off super easily so I'm super grateful for that.  Since I've never bought anything cooking related before I was worried this product would be of low quality compared to other sets that cost 3 times as much but I'm glad to say their quality overall seems pretty good and they have been working very well for us so far! I got this set when it was $130ish, but even at its non-sale price, I'd say this is a very good budget set to go for. It's got a nice variety that should cover a good amount of stuff you'd wanna cook and the ease of cleaning makes it a breeze to just clean it and cook something else right away after it cools."
"After much deliberation, I bought this set as it contained all the sizes of pans I normally use. Also, I have hand and wrist issues and can't use really heavy pans, so I was looking for a set that had good conductivity but easy for me to use. I had a previous set of Tfal pans that lasted 15 years, so I was willing to give these a try. I'm so glad I did! They are great. They look good, have a decent weight to cook well and stay balanced on my ceramic stove. They clean up so easily with soap and water. I only use silicone utensils and I let pans cool down before putting in cold water. No warping, no sticking. Most foods just slide out easily, and those that are more stubborn release with slight scrubbing with sponge. I cook basically oil free, and nothing has been an issue so far. I am really happy with these pans and hope they last as long as my last set."
"I did a lot of research before buying this set as this would be my first set of ""adult"" pots and pans of which I've spent a load of cash on. I looked on stores, I looked online, read reviews, hemmed and hawwed for months before I settled.  These are amazing, and the price paid has been worth every penny. The hear distributes evenly, they clean quickly, they're truly non-stick, even the rivets on the inside where the handles connect.  The variety of sizes of each pot and pan is truly what is great about this set. The handles are cool to the touch, even the lids.  This set is what I was searching for, what I needed. You won't be disappointed, nor will you need another set or a single piece to find that missing size needed."
"Purchase this set in April 2021. LOVE it. So many choices of sizes, so many lids. I have found it to be well coated with durable Teflon. Very scratch resistant. I have not seen any scratches yet. I take care to not use sharp object to cut or stir. My previous set was a Rachael Ray set and it was a mess, no matter how careful I was it scratched. This T-Fal set looks nice , cooks nice and cleans up nice. I still apply a little cooking spay for common sense things like eggs, but I highly recommend all T-fal products. I have some 30 year old cookie sheets, and a roaster pan that is still use to this day."
"I love these pans! They are amazing. They cook food evenly and well. And they are SOOO easy to clean. You can cook something and let it sit for a little bit and it doesnt need soaking or scubbing to get the residue off. When i cook something inside it slides right out as if it was never in the pan in the first place!! Ive had these 2 months now and I love using them. If you dont want to wash by hand, putting them in the dishwasher works well. So easy to clean! And so far i havent had any food stick to them (i still use cooking spray for eggs and such. But with veggies or meats, it doesnt stick or leave layers of cooked juices to the pan. Anything ""leftover"" comes off super easy without much effort. Highly recommend these pans!"
"So far so good. Wish fry pans had lids. I have less expensive T-fal from the '70's. Still used. Held up great. These are so much better. I only use on Med Hi heat. Works great, even heat. I have had a set of Wofgang Puck Stainless Steel....hated it. Everything stuck. After what I paid, couldn't afford to get rid of them. Gave them to a friend. Then Got copper chef. Did everything it said, with the exception of even heating. I hated the square Pans. The corners didn't heat evenly. The center browned, not corners. I couldn't get used to square pans. Pan OK. I love having 5 fry pans. And extra sauce pans. The griddle is great. The price was great. I got from the warehouse. It was described as good condition. Orginal box will be damaged. When it arrived it was packed in an Amazon box. I thought Uh Oh. Opened took out factory box. It had a small gouge about 3"". Not through. In side everything was factory packed. Perfect. Happy Dance. Saved over $125."
"I love these pans! I bought them about two years ago and they are still in great shape. Nonstick is great, heat distribution is great. I take care to wash them by hand. Best pans I’ve had."
"After only receiving this product today I must say right out of the box I was impressed by its sturdiness. I followed all the directions and gave the set a quick wash and season. After this I tried the good old egg test to see if it would stick. To my astonishment the egg flipped easily without even using oil or even a spatula to assist. I was then able to wipe the little bit of residue off with a paper towel that was dry. The only complaint if any as of now is that the ring did not turn fully red, but it was significantly redder than the cool pans. I do believe if left longer to preheat it would have turned even more, but I did not have the patience. As of now this is definitely a 5 star product and holds its on against the more expensive sets. I will re-review in a couple of months to see if my opinion has changed."
"Mom used to love her one, two T-Fal brand cookware and with this in mind, I purchased this set. It is all that and some! Having now owned the set for over 3 months, I can honestly say that it's a joy to cook again with all the options available. Steamed veggies? Not a problem for the steam basket and pot. Perfect eggs or egg if you wish? From the smallest to the bigger frying pans, even heat distribution guarantees a great omelet or sunny side up egg(s). I love the big, wide Dutch oven which is wonderful for potatoes, pasta, stew or any big meal item and have even started cooking more since getting this beautiful set delivered.  Big tip, listen to the reviews on here and don't use ""high heat"", it suffices to use medium heat to get the best end result and the pots, pans stay beautiful. I use a scrub sponge to clean after use and no issues, no scratches. Let's just say, I am looking forward to using this set for many, many years!"
"I gave this set ""5 stars"" for durability but in all honesty, I've only had it 3 months now so the most used item has maybe 20 dishwash cycles on it. So far, everything still looks and cooks like when I unboxed it. I noticed right away how much more evenly and completely the cookware heats. I like the feature of the T-fal emblem changing shades to tell you when the pan is properly pre-heated. And heat transfer is far superior to the crappy set I had. Water boils and food cooks quicker, for sure. Nice heavy handles with good gripping surfaces. They do get hot when you've had something simmering for hours, but that's to be expected. I had never owned a steamer or a griddle before but I use them both and I'm super glad I got a ""complete"" set of cookware with all the multi-use lids. No complaints with anything. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"I've owned my 17-pc set for nearly a year. Seasoned, as recommended, initially but haven't done so for months. If anything sticks, it rinses right out with a hot water swishing - never have to apply pressure to remove food residue. Cooking is even. The set looks great hanging from my husband's home-made rack. I've not seen a single scratch, but I try to always use wood or plastic utensils. This is the nicest cookware I've ever owned at 73 yrs old, and I expect it'll last til my cooking days are done. Still looks brand-new after heavy use for 10 months, and I'd buy it again any day! Don't believe the negative reviews, I think they're from competitors' families!"
"I ordered these pans after replacing my previous, very expensive set that we had. The previous set were scratching the surface and essentially ruined the glass top. After doing a ton of research it became clear that the pans I had were not meant for electric ranges and I needed a flat bottom.  Cost. I was impressed with the number of positive reviews this set got so I figured, for the price I could live with a mistake of this size. Seriously. It's less than $200 for all of this. 'Nuf said.  Packaging. The pans were packaged very well and didn't notice excessive waste in material. The box was deseptively small but it just kept producing pan after pan. It was incredibly light too, which made me nervous. Each pan is lightweight and easy to manage with a full meal inside.  The ""preheated"" indicator. I read a ton of negative feedback, so while it's cool in theory- I didn't have high hopes. I was wrong. It does exactly the job it's designed to do. I attached photos from my own experience.  Clean up. I read they're dishwasher safe and everyone has an opinion on that. Honestly clean up has been so easy on these pans I haven't felt the need or desire to wash them this way. Preheat the pan. Pay attention. You will feel the same way. So Sorry but no dishwasher help from me here.  Overall. I'm not really sure they'll last me forever But I would be okay investing this kind of cash for this kind of product every five years if necessary!!"
"I've had this 14 pieces cookware set for almost 2 months now and I've gotta say it's AWESOME!  I use this on a daily basis for anything you can imagine: from basic scrambled eggs to soups, creams, beans, rice and all proteins in every presentation. The pans will not disappoint in any way!! they can take anything I trow at them and at the end, easy to clean; you just gotta follow instructions and I'm sure they will last more than 5-7 years, easily.  Something that did happen to the sauce pan is that I left it with the stove pin on (electric stove, btw) for about 5hrs at mid heat with some tap water on (2 cups) to boil and forgot about it (quarantine while working and cooking at the same time: not a good combination). When I realized this, I went immediately to turn the stove pin off but the pan had already taken some damage: all water had gone evaporated and the pan got burned in the inside making the minerals from the water to get embedded on the pan. I honestly don't blame the pan's quality AT ALL. All I'm saying is that this things could happen if you let them happen. Read the instructions on the booklet and follow them correctly. There's nothing fancy about them, just good old, very logical and common sense basic rules.  BEST COOKWARE SET I'VE EVER HAD AT A GREAT PRICE.!"
"I loved these so much I bought 2 sets and they worked so well I bought their bake ware also. With halfway decent care they will last forever. I also go the big frying pan and 7 qt pot in addition to these. I cook then bake my omelets under the broiler and they are perfect. Those that got theirs that had no thermal spot or were not in a T-fal box was from the particular sender were probably counterfeit and were not genuine T-fal.If not in the original box send them back. I love mine and so will you. Hand wash. Occasionally,re-oil the pans,and take care of them. Better than Gotham steel or Blue diamond pans as I have both."
"One can easily spend a lot of money on Non-Stick pans at the big box store. Why do it? These pans are amazing! They look great, they OWN the stove top, easy to clean, and they last. I finally gave in and purchased another pair last month. The old set preformed for me 5 years without a negative. These sport an awesome handle that is very comfortable. I highly recommend them to cooks at any skill level!"
"This 17-piece set of cookware is a really great value (for what I paid for it--the Amazon price can fluctuate quite a bit, even during a single day, so you may have to check the price periodically until it hits your price point). The set is very well packaged and arrived without any damage whatsoever, not even a minor cosmetic scratch,. ding, or mar. The fry pans and saute pan are fairly thick aluminum, and distribute heat well. The pots are a bit thinner walled, but they don't need to be as thick to perform their function. The exterior and bottom are also very smooth, which I like, as it won't scratch my glass cooktop. So far, these pots and pans are very easy to clean. No issue with anything sticking. Other reviewers have complained that their fry pans were not perfectly flat--well mine aren't either, but it's a distinction without a difference; they're flat enough. They are flatter than my old set of fry pans, which I never had any issue with--I never even thought to check this until I read some of these reviews. So, yeah, perfect flatness doesn't really make much, if any, difference to their intended function. My only critique, and a mild one at that, is that the Thermo Spot Indicator is kinda gimmicky--yeah, it does change shade when it gets hot, but it never really becomes completely uniform (where the pattern essentially disappears). So it is only marginally useful."
"Usage of a product like this is important to avoid scratching or scorching a nonstick, you should avoid preheating while empty, high heat or forks. When using sprays and grease can leave a residue on non-stick pans that is difficult to remove and the way you clean it is very important. Its difficult to care for pans. These pans seem to be very smooth with eggs just like most nonstick pans even sausage and gravy in big pan, iv seen messed up pans in well over 200 places [work]. If anything I can change my reveiw based on their holding. 5 years for most nonstick but it was set to price 300 so 4?"
"Wifey wanted a new pot and pan set, she said she needed one, as she does most of the cooking. Needless to say, I picked a winner. She loves it. This set has it all. AND the easy to clean portion is a winner for me. I researched multiple different brands/sets. From online to department stores I chose this one and glad I did. Pros: Wife cooks more (she is a killer, good cook) Durable Even heat distribution Cleaning is easy  Cons: Makes me want to cook more  Family of 4 and we seldom eat out. We use some items 3 or 4 times a week and the others once or twice a month so it has everything we need and then some. 5star."
"My very knowledgeable friend recommended this brand. I did a great deal of research and found this brand, type of new and improved non-stick ware. Approved for glass top stoves. Has vents in lids and rubber handles to prevent burns. Cooks well and cleans easily. My husband is the cook and he very much likes it. I also bought a set of wooden spoons as suggested to protect the cookware."
"I bought a set of these because I wanted hard anodized cookware without the heavy-weight of them. I have very bad arthritis in my hands and cannot always handle the weight of the pans filled with food.  These fit the me perfectly. I have always used 'all-clad and calphalon. I still use them. But on bad days these are the next best thing.  Bought a set of these at Christmas for my son. He was so thrilled , when he went home he washed them immediately.  Will definitely buy again if I need a nice present."
I really love this cookware it met all my expectations. Easy to clean and I read all the instructions about keeping them in great shape. The only downfall was I wanted to see them in person at the store before purchasing but I could not find them in the store so when I came back to order them on Amazon the price was $50 more than I originally saw so I had to purchase the 14 piece instead of the 17 piece that I wanted. What a disappointment.
So I just got my set today and I'll be updating my review as time goes by. As many reviewers have already stated it comes in a regular brown box. There was no damage inside and all the pieces seems very solid but not overly heavy. I plan on hand-washing them mostly with occasional dishwasher use.  Update 1. Made some steaks w.o oil and 0 issues. Also made steaks with oil and again 0 issues. I hand washed after and inside looks brand new. Bottom has some discoloration.  Update 2: 1/14/18 : I used the smallest and mainly for eggs and they had stuff lipstick on it. You have to use a good layer of oil or spray to prevent it. I have a small brown spot I cant get off because I guess when I sprayed I missed a spot :/
"I will plan on updating this later to give you an idea on how well it holds up. But after 30 days of use, we are very impressed. Cooks evenly, cleans up real easy, and no non-stick spray is required. I do have two minor complaints. The first is that one of the handles is slightly loose. They are riveted on so there is no adjustment but it is very minor. The second complaint is that there is no lid to the smaller skillet. The large skillet and large fry pan have interchangeable lids but not the smaller one. This is not a deficiency since is never claimed to have a lid for it. But it should in my opinion. Both issues might knock down my rating by 1/2 star but since you can't do that, I'll keep it at 5-star. We would certainly recommend this to friends and family. Knowing all of this, I would still have purchased it. Great product for a good price."
"I was thoroughly impressed with this set after it arrived. This is just as easy, or maybe even easier, to clean that my old, cheap non-stick Teflon cookware. Since Christmas Eve, I've used every piece, even on high heat -- with no issues whatsoever...no warping, no flaking, no scratching, and the bottoms still look like they did when I first pulled them out of the box. I should note that they've all been used on a glass-top electric stove. All pots and pans feel very durable...definitely not cheaply-made! Just to make sure that you're reading the correct review for the correct item, this review is for the T-fal E765SH Ultimate Hard Anodized Scratch-Resistant 17-piece cookware set. I've also used metal utensils...again, with NO scratching, abrasions nor flaking. I highly recommend this product! If anything should change, I will update this review."
"This set of two nonstick pans are AMAZING! They are exactly what I was needing. Nothing sticks and I mean nothing. In fact I can brown ground meat or cook eggs and literally wipe the pan with a paper towel and it’s clean, like what?! I’ve been suffering with pans where everything sticks and Zi spend hours a week soaking and washing but not anymore! These pans are deep and my new favorite cooking essentials! There’s two in two different sizes (as shown on stove eyes in pics) and both are deep. Wow, I wish I had ordered these months ago! You can’t go wrong on these. Great product and great price! My old set is getting donated today!"
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.  UPDATE: First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking. - WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting. - NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability. - HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils.. - STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment. Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both. Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY."
"We've never owned a brand new set of dishes that we got for ourselves. We've always purchased something cheap when we needed to really replace and previous pot/pan. This time we decided we wanted a GOOD set of pots/pans and so far we are really enjoying these. Having the red T in the center with the dots to help show you when the pan is pre-heated and ready has been a big help in seeing that i've been getting some of my pans too hot. Cooking on lower temps seems fine. I will say this though, If you get the pan too hot, the foot can still semi stick to it, but not so bad that you'd need to worry. Cleanup has been nice and easy thus far, but i plan to re-review this after some time has passed."
I needed to replace a very worn skillet and after researching pans I decided that this two piece set was the right purchase. So glad I did. They are perfect. As with everything I read all the instructions which I am glad I did since it is stated that it is best not to use high heat so as not to damage the finish. No need since they heat so evenly it isn't necessary to have high heat. They clean up well and food doesn't stick at all as expected. I love having the two sizes. I am going to purchase another set for a gift.
"When I unpacked the pot & pans (which were well protected) I noticed the 10"" frying pan had a deep gouge in the coating. This clearly is a manufacturing issue.  I tried contacting the manufacturer but their voice mail said to fill out a form on their website so that's where it stands. I'm hoping for a quick response otherwise I'll return the entire set.  Update 01/19/20 The manufacturer had me return the set and Amazon sent a replacement. No problems with the new set. I'm very happy with the quality."

"Hello folks. I have been meaning to write a review about this product because when I saw some convincing reviews that this is a horrible product and showed pictures of how bad they were I almost did not buy them. It was the tone of the review though that had me think otherwise like maybe they were a competitor trying to steer me away. I also waited a year to write this review. so you can see what moderate use looks like. My interpretation of moderate is 6-10 times a week. the pots and/or pans get used. My wife and I both work so we normally cook enough on the weekends to so we have leftovers during the week. I have a gas range with the iron grates so these guys have no love on their bottoms.  We REALLY like this set. They are very light which is good but it is also something to be mindful of since it can easily go sliding on the stove top. After a few uses your mind adjusts so it does not happen very often. Each item is well balanced and the handle never gets hot to the touch. Unless you put them in the oven then you should use a oven mitt etc… Just like anything else you would use in the oven. They are very easy to clean. We do not put them in the dishwasher though. Being non-stick makes clean up a breeze! We use all types of utensils plastic and metal and we had our first little nick in the finish which I will point out in the photo. We have used it about a dozen times after that and it has not flaked or any change so I am not concerned about it. No issues with the lids. They are all still in perfect working order.  It is not perfect though. The biggest lid fits the biggest (10.25”) fry pan but the middle lid (8”) only fits the biggest pot and sauté pan but not the fry pan. it is annoying. 1st world problems, right? The rivets are not non-stick. those can take some work getting clean. Eggs in particular are a nuisance. Those are my gripes. that's it..  I take that back. My last gripe is the site page itself. They are reusing some pictures that do not reflect the T-Fal Titanium line. The best way to tell if you are buying the Titanium is that the base of the pan/pot will say titanium and the rivets will also be coated. That’s right folks they fixed my gripe in the titanium. I have the hard-anodized non-titanium version. I also have a 5-quart titanium sauté pan and the rivets are coated. That pan is perfect in my humble opinion just too big for normal everyday use.  The photos are as of 3-14-2017. I only took pictures of the most used items the two fry pans and a pot. All others are in even better shape! Hope my review helps with your decision. Why is my non-titanium review in a titanium product page? I do not know. When I went to past orders and clicked on it this is where it directed me to. Honestly though.. If I had the titanium line. it would be 5 stars."
"I got this T-fal set during the X-mas sales. It is a 100% great value for the money. So easy to clean, cooks so well, heat distribution is great, has the little red T-fal mark in the center of the skillets to show when they are how enough. It's very good quality entry cookware for anyone looking for an entire non-stick set. The only negative takeaway I have is that if I was going to do it again, I would really consider the Emeril set, the coating seems to be a little tougher on them"
"I love these pans they clean easy nothing sticks inside or out the secret is no hlgh heat I wash by hand i would never put these in the dishwasher they almost wash there self I highly recommend these pans after years of stainless steel and scouring pads to keep them shiny no more of it. Try them once you""ll throw the other ones out."
"After much research I bought this pan, a little reticent to what it would be like. I've been using it for about 6 weeks and it has been fantastic! It's made a huge difference in my small kitchen, which before I purchased this pan, had no nonstick cookware. Now I'm easily making things that were much more of a struggle before. The cleanup couldn't be easier. The coating is appearing to be holding up well so far, and the nonstick qualities have been great. Makes our vegan scrambles, tofu for curries, and taco meat simmers so much easier. A great purchase especially for my new quarantine cooking adventure."
"I use a frying pan to cook bacon, sauté mushrooms with bell pepper and then turn them into an omelette. The coating on my ancient nonstick pan was deteriorating, so a few months ago I bought an inexpensive pan from Costco. The Costco pan had two problems. The bottom of the pan was high in the middle, so the grease from the bacon ran to the edges. After only a few months the pan lost much of its nonstick property. The Calphalon pan is flat and cleans easily. The only reservation I have is minor. When I move the pan from the stove to the sink and put water in it, the part of the handle nearest the pan stays hot unless I go out of my way to cool it off."
Really poor quality. After using a silicon spatula twice on the pan it already has a chipped surface and doesn’t cook evenly. Never seen a pan so poorly made.
"The skillet worked good the first 2 months of use. I have followed all Care Instructions and hand washed the skillet (I don't own a dishwasher). After 2 months of use, it has lost any non stick properties. I have even tried a small amount of olive oil and everything sticks. I am totally unsatisfied with my purchase!"
"I have always bought Calphalon fry pans and they usually last 4 - 6 years. I have been very satisfied in the past with their non-stick, even heating durable features. But this new model is truly outstanding! I used to need at least an inch of olive oil to fry my cutlets, now I only need half that amount. I probable don't need any at all, but what's a veal cutlet without that crispy coating and EVOO taste? The oil does not burn at all nor does it adhere to the outside of the pan either. I love that this one came with a glass cover. With the cover, no need to flip eggs to get them to that ""over easy"" texture. When I'm ready for new pots, Calphalon will be at the top of the list for replacements."
This pan is very high quality. Love cooking with it
"We love this skillet! It is large and easy to clean. Very even heat distribution. Like all Calphalon cookware, you must use the associated plastic utensils such as spatulas and stirring spoons to avoid scratching the non-stick cooking surface. In other words, don’t use steel utensils."
I really cannot comment on this scratch-resistance of the pan since I have only used it a few times. I will say that it was so easy to clean. One of my adult daughters was here and wanted to claim it if I were to die so I guess you can say that she was impressed too.
"Purchased this skillet specifically for my wife when she makes omelets and it works wonderfully for that. In addition, it is now the first skillet we pull out to use for almost all other stove top cooking. It is very uniform and the non stick coating is great."
Purchased based on reviews. Very easy to clean. Doesn’t require any oil. Uses low heat. Must remember not to put in dishwasher and not to use metal utensils.
"This pan is garbage. The surface is nice and slippery but that is where the good ends. The pan is thin and cheap. On the first use I only heated the pan up on medium and it warped. I have a flat top stove and on heat 5 of 10 the pan turns into a bowl shape and rocks around. This causes very uneven heat distribution. This is a $10 pan with a $50 coating. Not to mention the coating is not durable at all. Save your money, its trash. What a shame."
"The best skillet I have ever owned - cooks evenly, minimal use of any oil, non stick, easy to clean, my eggs over easy turn out perfect now!! Excellent quality!!"
So pleased with even heat and easy clean up! Nice to brown on stove and then bake in oven - heavy duty glass lid is great!
"Good quality, easy to clean and no need for oil. A little heavy but good overall."
I love this pan. To sure why the bad reviews. This cooks beautiful.
Great buy ...cooks evenly...easy to clean...only use wooden or plastic utensils
"So far,so good. It's lighter than my previous skillet but as long as it continues to retain it's finish, I'm happy."
This is the non-stick easy to clean skillet you always hope for.
Love this pan. It is big enough and easy to clean. I don't cook much but this pan makes it easy. Love It.
Very good cooking with this product. Very easy to clean.
Excellent pan. As advertised.
"I’m an establish cook, I’ve used all different types of pans. This pan makes cooking easy. Nothing sticks, easy to clean & looks great."
"Love to cook in this pan, of course not as good as cast iron, but who wants that weight all the time!!"
Excellent product- larger size makes cooking easy. Great for glass cook top.
"Wish it was dishwasher safe, but other than that, this is a great pan!"
"Use this pan at least once a day- great eggs, omelettes, stir fry vegetables, and more. Large capacity makes it great for larger famiy"
"Cooks great, easy to clean, not too heavy. A perfect pan!"
High quality and easy to clean
Wife loves it.
Liked the pan. Cooks super.
"Large heavy pan. Huge on my stove. Non-stick performance was spectacular for the first 8-10 uses. Washed only with soft sponge at first. Then foods started sticking a bit, and had to start using the scrub side of my scotchbrite sponge. I felt like I went out of my way to baby this pan, using only silicone covered tools for a time, but nevertheless, non-stick performance continued to decline steadily. I will probably replace within a year of purchase. It’s still useful for now, but not as good as what I’d hoped for."
"I bought this ceramic coated pan after watching the movie “Dark Waters”, about people that got very sick from the chemicals in Teflon, non-stick pans. I had this for maybe a couple months before I noticed the first chip, and thought maybe I just need to be more careful when storing the pan, and putting it in the sink? I only use wood or silicone utensils on it, and always hand wash, yet somehow it still manages to get more chips and scratches. Super disappointing as I don’t want to use it anymore since it’s chipped to the material underneath. I don’t want to risk any chemicals or pan material chipping or seeping into our food. I was hoping to avoid paying a hefty price tag for 100% ceramic cookware, but I should have just done that from the beginning b/c the money spent on this pan (and I also bought two other smaller sizes of the same type, the medium sized one also scratched now) is a waste. Lesson learned!"
"I bought this thinking it was top-of-the-line non-stick. It's not bad, I guess...certainly better than the ""Blue Diamond"" skillet I bought from Walmart. I cook breakfast in the skillet. Sausage, bacon and eggs. After the first few mornings I started to have to really scrub it to get the sausage off of it. Friend of mine suggested using oil or butter. So now I melt a pat of butter before cooking and that seems to work pretty well. But as far as I'm concerned that seems to defeat the purpose of a non-stick surface."
"This would be a great pan IF the description did not claim it can be used on electric stovetops. The bottom of the pan is rounded, which is fine if you have a gas stovetop. But on an electric stovetop, only the spot in the middle touches the heating element, resulting in everything in the middle burning, even at low settings. Other than that, the pan is well made."
"We bought this pan in February 2021 and really loved it. When it arrived, and for several months afterward, we used it almost daily and it became the favorite in our kitchen! It is now December 2021 and the pan is almost unusable. It looks like the nonstick finish is almost completely removed. Instead of the shiny grey surface, it is now dull and matte, and sticks to everything. I’m genuinely bummed about this because the price and Calphalon name would indicate a higher quality, more long lasting item. Maybe we got a defect but I wouldn’t suggest this as a purchase"
Bottom was a little thinner than expected and slightly warped. We bought it to add to our classic set but it's different. On a gas stove it may be fine but we have a glass top and it rocks a little.
"It massive so much bigger than I wanted, but pretty nice except for having to hand wash the bastard. Wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't almost as big as the sink."
This is an oil infused pan. It is very non stick so far (I’ve used it like 6x). Heats evenly.
"I do serious cooking at home, and this Calphalon just was not up to the task. The ceramic coating lasted less than three months before food started to stick, blackening much of the pan. I’ve tried everything to get it off: baking soda, vinegar, etc… To no avail, it just keeps getting worse. The residue is burnt-on and growing—the pan is useless.  Update: After less than a year, I had to throw the pan out. The pan was coated in black residue. Calaphon should be ashamed—their product is a disgrace."
A pat of butter makes it come clean so much faster.
"I followed all the care instructions and treated the skillet with kid gloves, no metal utensils or abrasives ever. Slowly the nonstick qualities faded and now everything sticks. The cast iron skillet I bought 50 years ago is more nonstick, and I'm going back to it."
I have purchased pans from Calphalon about two years ago and absolutely loved them. I was expecting the same quality when I ordered this pan…but was met only with disappointment. Literally the very first time I used this pan everything that touched it stuck. I used it in the exact same way I’ve used my other Calphalon pans but this pan performed like it cost $10. Don’t waste your money…it’s not worth it.
Not impressed. Everything sticks and it is a pain to clean. It has to constantly soak in the sink.
"Skillet is well made and lightweight. After the 3rd use I was no longer able to get it clean. When food sticks to this skillet, it really sticks! I ended up throwing the skillet away. It’s possible that I am not using the skillet correctly, but I was looking for an easy to use and easy to clean skillet. I had purchased it as a trial before I ordered an entire set. Now I know to keep looking for suitable a pots and pans set."
"After a few uses, the cooking surface was coated with cooked on grease which could not be removed without an abrasive."
"Sent back the first one because it was far from flat. Ordered another, just like it, to see if we just had a fluke. Second one was flat, but after about two months of normal use, cleaning properly and using proper utensils, it completely lost its non-stick surface. I have a Ninja pan that works so much better, we've had it nearly a year, and it's still non-stick and flat. We'll never use Calphalon again."
Garbage. Everything sticks to it. You can buy a better pan at a dollar store.
Cook bologna and it scorched the pan and left a brown color on surface of pan. Which i tried to soak and clean with no success. Surface is not a non sticK on this brown area. Not satisfied with this purchase.
Update have had this pan only using silicone or bamboo utensils in it while cooking and everything sticks. It’s horrible to wash very disappointed
"At first seemly nothing would stick to it, but now in September ( Bought it in may) No matter what I do everything sticks to it. Had to start using older teflon pans I already had."
"Worked great for a month, then things started to stick. Have been very careful to follow cleaning directions and now after about 4 months everything sticks, even with a good coat of oil on the pan. Tried to contact the manufacturer through Amazon and the link is broken. Would not recommend or buy again"
Food sticks to the bottom. Tough to scrape and clean. Only three months worth of use. too late to return.
Scrambled eggs stick to it. Burgers ruined it. This was the worst pan I ever purchased. Oh... not one scratch. Just never worked as non stick.
This pan was purchased as a gift as it seemed to be a great product. The picture attached is the results of cooking with it on very low heat which is causing the oil to burn. This product does not perform as intended. I would like to return this product and receive a refund.
Pan is anything but non-stick. Very disappointed. Other Calphalon pans have been great. This one is not.
"After a month of use, some food stuck to it. Can mostly be cleaned, with great effort, but then more food will stick. Also too thin."
"Purchased a new pan and it was clearly used. Non-stick surface was scratched and stained, bottom looks like it had been used for months. I have noticed more and more items received that are heavily used. Bad customers and bad quality control at the warehouse"
Definitely not worth spending $70+ on this pan. I had a cheap $20 pan from Target and it was way more nicer then this one. For example even a simplest thing to cook like Omelette sticks to this pan and you can spend 15 mins scrubbing it but the the surface won't become clean.
Terrible. Pans were sticking almost immediately. Returned 3 pans.
Six months after purchasing and this is what it looks like after cooking. Everything sticks to it. We just threw it away. The old Calphalon pans were much better
Horrible pan. It was non-stick for about a month and now everything sticks to it. Do not buy this pan unless you enjoy crunchy everything.
It is not non-stick.
Pan was not new.
I really don't understand the negative reviews either they don't understand the care & treatment of this pan or they just want to be negative! I can't say enough good things about Calphalon products. I've been using there items for over 10 years now & have never been disappointed! I use my ceramic oil infused fry pan 4-5 times a week & it still looks brand new!
This was after 3 months. I own a Hex Clad Wok that I use 90% of the time that still looks new. I pay $60 for what I thought was a decent pan and it's ruined. I only use silicon utensils so it's not from using metal utensils. I'm very disappointed in this pan!
The item received was not the item ordered. It was a gift and the recipient said it was fine but I'm very disappointed that an item was substituted without my permission
"This pan was great when we first got it but after about 2-3 months it’s junk. Egg whites stick NO MATTER WHAT you put in the pan, non-stick spray, or oil. And the coating scratches very easily just from trying to clean of the food that stuck to it. If I could give it a 0 I would. Do not buy."
Works great! Waited until we used it numerous times to provide a review. Holding up well and still non-stick.
Works very well attractive skillet. Concerned that if I were to drop it it might dent.
"Wow, nothing sticks to this pan! I was worried that it wouldn't brown meat/fish well, but found that it does. I've tried veggies and meat, and have been happy with how they brown. I even sent one to my son-in-law who loves to cook."
everyday - heating vegetables / like for dinner.
True to description very easy to clean handle doesn’t get hot stuff doesn’t attach to the bottom it’s durable and dishwasher safe I really like it perfect size also
The handles are a nice length and never heat up.
These pots are fantastic! The handles stay cool and have a nice feel. Everything cooks nicely. Love them!
"Very well made, sturdy. Just the sizes I was looking for. Food doesn’t stick."
long handles and sturdy in your hands
"Update: had this for a couple of months. it’s starting to rust. This is not true stainless. Downgrading from 4 to 2 stars.  Original: There is a trend for these small saucepans for heavier build. And i understand that this provide more even heating. However, my mother needed something more lightweight due to arthritis. These saucepans fit that perfectly in that they thick enough to be durable, but thin enough to remain lightweight. The only issue i see is that the lip is a bit too sharp. Most pots pans tend to have the edge nicely rounded and this you can feel like harsh corners of the edges. Other than that it's great."
"Everyday meal preparation, impressed with the quality for the price."
I needed an induction compatible very small pot. Very well built and delivered rapidly.
Nice saucepans to add size variety to cooking.
"Absolutely LOVE the pots!! Great quality, easy to wash great handle grip. Highly suggest to purchase!!"
These pots replaced pans I had for over 20 years: Quality is wonderful. Will no doubt be good for a very long time
The heft is easy to manage while sturdy enough to take everyday use. Did I mention it's beautiful!
like the size perfect for two people and easy to clean
Two very nice sauce pans for my new induction stove.
Good quality!
"Fácil de limpiar , buena presentación"
I like them. Just what I expected.
Nice quality and easy to clean
Bought these in the mean time because my wife and I have our eyes on more expensive ones. First impression was that they are thin and light. That pretty much tells me they used thin metal but that's what I paid for right. They are working well for us now. Haven't had any staining yet but this is a fresh review. We'll see long term how they perform.
"NICE kitchenware for a Bachelor to have, cooking for self finally, these pans definitely helps! ...Gratitude. 😁👍👍"
Kind of a pain in the butt to clean
The pan is fine.  The cover is badly designed - it gets hot so you can burn your hands. Other pan covers do not do this.
Small size is perfect for small meals. Surprisingly easy to clean
"Love, love, love them"
The pots are light weight but do the job are a good product for the price.
So far so good. I like that the handle stays cool. Food sticks to the bottom but not too bad.

"Got these for my mother who (bless her heart) has been using the same beat up saucepans with cheap nylon handles that she got as hand-me-downs from her G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Great grandma who I think got them from the lost colonists of Roanoke island who decided they'd rather run off than burn something with them again. Anyway... some thoughts:  What we like: - Excellent heat transfer: She has coil burners, and there's typically a 'cool' spot in the middle of pan where the burner coils don't reach. These distribute well enough that we don't see that spot. - Long handles. Good for deep stoves and inserting into the oven. - Easy to clean. So far, even with minor scratches, the metal remains durable and with natural non-stick common to good quality stainless steel  What we find lacking: - A little light: For mom they are good, she's a bit older. But for me, for the price point they seem a little on the thinner metal side, a little too lightweight. - Lid handles are obnoxious. They stick up so high as to limit stackability and tucking into the proofing drawer, and don't even try to hang them on the inside of lower cupboard doors.  Overall, excellent to cook with, she likes them, and now she's insisting I get married and give her 11 generations of babies, grandbabies and such, so the family can use these until the year 2525. (If man is still alive)"
"I have been using my Instant Pot for a LOT of things in the past year, and got away from stovetop cooking, but I LOVE these saucepans. The quality is outstanding, they heat up quickly, the vented lid's top handle is designed for a 'cool to the touch' grab, the long-ish handles stay cool, the rims are flanged for no-drip pouring, and they're sturdy stainless steel. I have other saucepans, but they all have non-stick finishes, and I prefer the clean, 'no chemicals' approach these days. I've been using these almost daily for 2 weeks, for everything from oatmeal to soups, pasta, and sauces and gravies. They might require a little more work than non-stick cookware when it comes time for cleanup, but the steel is of such good quality, that they've been cleaning up like brand new every time. I use Barkeeper's friend on my Instant Pot liner to keep it looking new, and the same goes for these. I did a variety of cheese and cream sauces in these for Thanksgiving, and they didn't require steel wool soap pads for cleaning. I've been the chef of the house for 40+ years, and I have Calphalon, Tramontina, Swiss Diamond, All-Clad, et al, and the quality of these is on an even par, if not better than some. I'm loving using these, because they're sized right for small dishes, and they also don't take up a lot of room on my 5-burner cooktop. I'm really pleased with the performance and quality of these."
"We recently used these to cook dinner and they heated evenly and look great. They are not super heavy like All-Clad for instance (some of our other pots), but they are very comfortable in the hand, and easy to move around. They are also very easy to clean in the dishwasher or sink (we've done both), and they look great if left on the stove. The handles for the lids are different (more solid, than a loop). Perfect sizes for quick warm ups for kids, or mac and cheese or snacks, too. We love them!"
Every item I have by Michelangelo has been wonderful! These 1 & 2 qt. pans are great! I love the stainless steel and quality craftsmanship. These pans look good and work great. You can use them on the stove and in the oven. I’m always happy when they’re dishwasher safe too. Highly recommended.
"These two lovely stainless steel pans with lids that are great for makes sauces, gravies, or a small side. They clean up easy and have a nice weight to them. The have the 3 ply clad stainless bottoms that work great for even cooking! I love That they are oven safe and can be used on mostly all cooking platforms to include induction!"
"Stainless pots are wonderful especially with the clad bottom. One and Two quart sizes make them extremely versatile for most kitchens. Clean up after use is just as easy, too. Heat transfer was quick bringing food to temp faster than other flat bottom pots. Nice!"
Easy to clean it wipes out food easily. The pots are perfect size for different meals. Well made and not heavy.
These items are outstanding and clean very easily. First time cooking start off with low temperature because these pots are thin and neat quickly.
Nothing yet. I needed new sauce pans. Can’t wait to use them.
"Good, sturdy, even heat. Good buy"
It's perfect for cooking in.
Solid pans. Handles are very meh but for the price weren't bad
Love it! So glad I made this purchase! Worth every dime!
Looks very nice but even making a pot of boiled rice stained the bottom cannot get it clean btw did not burn the rice
"Switched from non stick pots and pans and bought this option to try. You will not get better for the price!! Heats quickly and any discoloration comes off easily! For stuck on messes I just boiled some baking soda, vinegar and water and good as new!"

"My only complaint/bitch is that these pans do not have lips so draining stuff can be exciting! (Stuff in the pan can quickly end up in the sink!) I bought these to stop the lid handle getting too hot to hold, while draining. The lid handle still gets hot, but when I use that lid on a pan with a lip I can drain stuff without the discomfort of burning my hand. (I use my nails to hold the pan lid in place!) These pans allow me to cook my food in the way I want. I can easily overcome any usage inconveniences! Expect these pans to last my lifetime, so I consider them money well spent."

"I bought this and the pot with lid. I think it's great. Non stick works great with eggs and other foods. Easy to clean by hand washing it with gentle sponge or cloth.  Don't use these or any other non stick pan with high heat. For high heat use cast iron or stainless steel. Use these on low to medium heat.  Also don't put any non stick pans in dishwasher, hand wash them and they will last longer and stay in great condition."
So I needed to replace an old Teflon non-stick pan. I spent a couple of minutes checking out the new non-stick coated pans. This one had very good reviews and was the perfect size for eggs and omelets. I went ahead and pulled the trigger and am glad I did so. When making eggs/omelets I always throw in a bit of butter to grease the pan. With the old Teflon pan I would sometimes get spots that stuck. That is not at all the case with this pan. Nothing sticks to it. It is always very easy to flip your eggs. The pan performs as good as it looks. If you are looking for a small frying pan I highly recommend this one.
"I have had it for 2 months now and it is still in perfectly new condition. This makes it the best nonstick frying pan I have ever had. My electric stove top only goes up to about 250 F degrees, but this temp still quickly kills all other frying pans, not this one it is still granite and the is not even discolored yet.  Update: 7/13/18. Still in perfect condition, looks like new accept a lot of oil and cooking residue but the granite coating is still perfect! Best frying pan I have ever had."
"They say no harmful things and that its ILAG but if you google what that is, its another trade name for PTFE!  ""We discovered that Eterna, Eclipse, QuanTanium, HALO, Xylan, Skandia, Dura-Slide, Granite Rock, Granitium, ILAG and even some types of Greblon (which was originally only a ceramic coating) are all trade names for PTFE."""
The Carote pans are by far the best pans I have ever had. They are super easy to clean and cook in. They just wipe right out. I would recommend these to anyone. I love them!!! My first purchase was a 3 piece set. I loved them so much I purchased more sizes. I got these for my camper. But we are using them in our home now too.
This is what happened when I cleaned it: black dust coming off from the bottom and from the inside of the pan!!! Seriously disgusting and probably toxic
I've used twice so far and it works great. I have done eggs and pancakes in here without oil and its been good.
"I first bought an 11"" one, which is great. Non-stick, easy to clean and everything you could ask for.  However this 9.5"" one is very different than my previous one. Even if it's non-stick eventually, things stick at first even with a lot of oil. I have to scratch them with a silicon spatula. My guess is that the heat distribution is not evenly  The other problem is that when the pan is heating on low/medium heat, it makes a cracking sound, which is scary. I've never heard such a thing from an empty, new and cold/warm pan! The noise keeps coming. I don't know what is wrong with this item, but it certainly shouldn't have passes a quality check  It's too bad that I already used the item, so I don't know if they'd accept a return. I don't recommend this product as a cracking sound is the last thing you expect from a pan"
"I purchased this pan about a month ago and have pretty much used it on a daily basis. I really love it and wish the company offered a few more sizes. I would definitely purchase more. The pan does not stick, I usually put a tiny bit of olive oil in the pan and wipe it around before using and nothing sticks. Eggs cook perfectly. The pan is also very easy to clean. I am hoping the pan will hold up with continued use. I feel like it is so much better than the toxic Teflon pans that only last a very short time. I highly recommend!!"
"This frying pan is very great, it looks so beautiful,that handle feeling is very good! I cooked some bacon, wiped out the pan with paper towel, and then I cooked two scrambled eggs, it worked wonderfully, non-stick at all, the eggs literally slid out of the pan onto my plate. This pan is also very easy to clean, the food residue flakes off under the water power alone, it's amazing! I believe I will also buy this series products in the future!"
"What we have here is a premium piece of stone cookware. The second you unearth it from its packaging, if you care a whit about craftsmanship, you will be tempted to embrace it like your strong & stoic firstborn babe. Get one of these sturdy zeniths of industrial design and two well-seasoned cast irons, and your stovetop is set for life. This robust pan is exceptionally easy to clean - no sticking - and free of discoloration. No carcinogenic nastiness that we know of. Very difficult scorch, though, of course if you really put your mind to it, you can. The only time I saw it take permanent damage was when it was left on an burner turned to max for approximately 40 min. Even still, it was usable afterward & there's been no problem with quality of use.  It is somewhat convex - someone pointed that out with ire. Oil pools in a little moat around the center, but the island is still close to sea level subject to flooding. I haven't found any pans like this that aren't that way, but maybe there's some secret utopia of perfectly flat pans known only to advance chefs inducted into the Holy Order of Non-Convex Cookware. Frankly, I haven't been looking for this, so maybe it's more common than I think. Either way, the pan isn't so convex that it's challenging to cook with. It cooks perfect eggs if you act as the brains of the partnership. It does still require you to do some of the thinking, but the bright side is that you aren't out of a job yet.  Treat this splendidly crafted little pan with proper care & you shan't go wanting.  Edit: it's been brutally scorched 3 times due to inane misuse and is still fully functional. The pan is very impressive. The cook, arguably less so. When this weary trooper is laid to rest under a little stoneware tombstone in the backyard, I will order 2 more just like it. There's no need to get any other sort of egg pan ever again, probably."
"MADE IN CHINA! This product offers false advertising. When the product description reads “Natural Stone material from Switzerland”, one assumes the product is made in Switzerland. Shame on me 😡 I will be returning it."
"Misleading description, After receiving on Cardboard directions says made in China. Have not used yet, trying to decide if I will return it instead I definitely would not have purchase if I had known"

"I love this non-stick pan. It's the first one I've used where bacon can stick and leave a coating in the pan and wash out completely; I kept the heat to medium, however. I've ruined many a non-stick skillet by allowing something to get too hot and stick and damage the surface. This cleaned perfectly after bacon cooked brown and stuck hard to it. One thing, you can see in the picture that I cheated and gently turned the bacon with a metal fork and scratched the pan, even though I was being careful not to scrape the surface. Use only plastic utensils. This is brand new and already scratched. I've never used this Carote surface before and so far I like it much better than other non-stick coatings. While the coating may be invented by the Swiss, I think this pan is from China?"
"i've been cooking since i could reach the stove, and for over 40 years i have bragged about only two non-cast-iron pans. this is one of them. i've tried a dozen pans that claim to never stick or only needs a little oil, and they all lie! the copper ones, green ones, ceramic ones...all trash after the first use and food sticks like the surface was made with the backside of a postage stamp. NOT THIS PAN! This lives up to the hype and has quickly become my favorite pan, and i tell anyone about it, if i can sneak it into conversation. i mean NOTHING sticks to it, i've made eggs, tomato sauces, stews, scores of meat, and i love this pan. almost as much as my cast irons, which still win because you can stick those in the oven. this pan, you cannot, because of the handle. that is the only flaw, and not worth losing a star over--especially considering i wanted to give 6 stars for ""easy to clean"". Get it, gift it."
"Beautiful and a great price.  When you find an attractive pan, there are always special rules. This one says don’t over heat. That can be confusing for a pan, but it is better than “don’t use vegetable oil.” I usually cook with margarine or oil in the bottom anyway. I would imagine it is just because whatever oil you line it with, it will burn if left without food in it.  This is so attractive with the wood grain handle and the very solid coating, i don’t mind making sure to put a bit of oil in the bottom every so often after washing."
"After a poor experience with an expensive, kitchen specialty mall store omelet pan, I tried this one. Surely such an inexpensive pan couldn't do the job.  Boy, was I surprised. Pleasantly. This pan is solid, thick, and smooth - much more value than many higher priced utensils. Seriously, I cleaned the pan the first three times with a paper towel - period. It's amazing.  I'm not kidding about the brick-like texture. I closed my eyes and ran my fingers over the inner surface - brick! How it manages to be so fabulously non-stick I simply cannot explain. I just love it.  Only one small complaint; the care advisory is printed on the backside label in WHITE TYPE ON ORANGE BACKGROUND! The paragraphs almost disappear. And it's about 6-point (small print), magnifying glass type. So to the packaging designers, a big fail.  Buy the frying pan anyway."
"It is a rough finish inside that does not work well because food sticks to it. The center of the pan is high and so the stuff in the middle of pan will burn. Noticed it right when I seasoned the pan, because the oil to season would be gone in the center of pan but be a 1/4 deep at sides of pan. Would have sent back but it will cost me to send it back even though its defective in my opinion."
"I have requested for replacement and really hope the 2nd one comes fine, but want to let buyers know that, when I initially opened the package and as I was washing the pan for the first time with soft sponge to prep for use, I felt 3 scratches/dents on the pan's surface. Please be cautious to check. FYI too that the pan came in a box with only a plastic bag around it without any care instruction or anything else."
"I bought this for my spouse who “needed it”, and by that I mean I accidentally burned the crap out of the OXO Teflon 10” pan and need to replace it so he could effortlessly make scrambled eggs again. He struggles with the stainless steel set we have and wanted something easier to clean than the cast iron. It is the easiest to clean of all the pans I’ve ever encountered in my entire life.  I got the 12” with the glass lid and am so pleased with it. It takes a couple minutes for it to preheat, longer than my stainless steel, and about the same amount of time as my cast iron, but that’s no bother. My spouse does not preheat it and it still serves his purposes, but I wanted to see if I could brown some meat on it, hence the preheating and it was effective.  It appears to be very well made. I think we’ll be holding onto it for years to come. It’s also quite nice to look at."
"I purchased this skillet on May 20, 2018. I have used it at least once a day since I received it. I mostly prepare eggs in it. It does a great job. It heats evenly, cleans up great and the handle is very comfortable to hold. I only hand wash it as it stated in the care directions and I don’t use any metal spatulas on it. It still looks new. I would like to have a larger size skillet just like it!"
"I've owned a lot of non-stick pans in my life. This is the best. Leagues better than any other. When I bought it I thought the handle was wood. It is not. It is some type of siliconized plastic. The handle cleans easily and is supposed to take 350 degrees F. Just to name a few, I've owned Farberware, Calphalon, T-Fal, Cuisinart, Oxo, the stupid green ceramic Eco-Pan that lasted one use before it began to ""stick."" Usually I get 12-24 months out of a pan before it's ruined (usually by a family member accidentally scratching it with the point of a knife). But the coatings on all of the other pans I've owned seem ""soft"" and after a few months use, the surface has changed (water doesn't bead up on them). This coating is superior. I use it 1-4 times a day, and its just like the first time I used it. I also own a bunch of cast iron pans, but they are not very non-stick when cooking acidic foods like tomatoes and tomatillos. This pan is; and I love it. It was on sale for $11 when I bought it. I did not get paid for this review."
I was very skeptical when I got this pan and It didn’t have some kind of coating on it similar to Teflon. I was sure it was not going to be nonstick. Wow was I wrong! This pan is incredible. Just follow the instructions and nothing sticks to this pan is is so easy to clean I’m going to buy a whole set of them if I can find a set.Best nonstick pan I have ever owned! The thing that’s really great about this pan is it does not have a coating on it. All my Teflon pans eventually start shedding little particles of Teflon into the food which is very scary. This pan is completely made out of the nonstick material so there’s nothing to peel off. You can wipe it clean with a paper towel it’s wonderful.
"I purchased this after getting a Calphalon 2 pc set.. Well I'm Keeping this pan and also getting a larger of this same pan and returning the Calphalon pans. The Calphalon pan sets burn my food too easily and also the bottom of those pans also burn. Plus it is hard to clean them whereas these Carote pans are easy to clean inside and outside. even burn marks on the bottom come off quickly and easily. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good non-stick pan, especially for eggs. I have made an omelet in the 8"" pan twice (So Far) and it comes out better than I have ever done before. The Omelet looks like a professional Omelet."
"I ordered this pan specifically to make omelettes which I make bout twice a week with much sticky cheese. I was skeptical that this surface would be no stick but I liked the size as well as the appearance of the pan. Here is what I found. Appearance: I love how it looks which is important because I keep it in clear view near our stove. Function: My omelette cooks evenly on both low and medium high heat with just a touch of olive oil used in the pan before heating and then adding the eggs and cheese. I can fold the omelette in half and then even flip it over with ease with no concern about the egg, cheese or vegetables sticking to the pan. Cleaning: If I wanted to, I could just wipe out the pan with a damp cloth and it would look perfectly clean. I do worry about olive oil built up so I do use a bit of detergent and water to wash the pan. It cleans up easily. In short this pan fulfilled, even exceeded my every expectation."
"Shopping for skillets is a lot like shopping for pain relief. There are waaaay too many to find the type you need, and the only way to know is to get it home & try it. I had some very specific things I looked for. This little skillet met them all... Affordability: I can’t remember how many cheap skillets I’ve bought & tossed because it’s a crapshoot every time. I’m always the loser. I won’t even look at “Celebrity Name Cookware”. Or anything else I’d need a bank loan for. This skillet is on the low side of the middle. Cooking Area: Skillets are measured by the top open area. This is not at all important. What IS important is the bottom flat surface area - the actual cooking surface. Most skillets are 3” - 4” less than what they say it is. Your 12” pan has an 8” surface. This skillet has high, straight walls & 6” surface. Durability: I am never going to drive a truck over my skillet. I’m also not going to beat it with a hammer. So I’m not sure what’s the point of telling me this info. It FEELS well made. Nothing loose. Nothing flimsy. That’s all I care about. Non Stick - Without Extra Effort By Me: I’m never going to place a bag of wrapped candy in my pan. I’m never going to burn cheese in it, either. Why would I? This skillet has a nice, “stoned” surface that I seasoned before first use. So far, everything still slides around like it should. That’s what I’m looking for. A skillet to cook food in. Not a science project I love this 8” pan so much that I ordered the 12” one. I think these skillets will be the last ones I’ll ever need. This is “Must Have” cookware!"
"I've cooked in it twice. I cook an egg omelet every other day for breakfast. The day in between I cook oatmeal :)  I thought it might need curing, but it doesn't absorb oil at all. I should have known. The second omelet I gave it the ""cheese"" test. I tried frying cheese before I put the eggs in the pan. Worked like a charm. No sticking whatsoever. I do spray with Pam, but that doesn't stop my other ""non-stick"" pan from sticking. I cook on a gas stove. I recommend it with 5 stars for now. I'll see if the non stick cooking continues. Because I bought the grey one, I can't see when butter starts to reach the ""nutty"" light brown stage. I can't tell in some of my other pans either though. I didn't read closely enough and thought the handle was wood, but when I tried to prepare it with oil, I saw that it is a composite. Probably better, though it certainly would pass for wood. Great pan so far. Exactly what I hoped it would be. Great non-stick pan as advertised. Some of my glass lids fit it perfectly, so I guess the 10"", is a standard size."
"Not sure about the negative reviews on here that I read before I decided to purchase, however, despite them, I decided to go for it and check this pan out for myself.  When it arrived, packaging was perfect and the pan was in excellent shape! The FIRST thing I did was check the instructions on the back of the packaging it came in and saw it needed just a few simple steps before 1st use so maybe the negative reviews given by others were not considering that before using the pan right away? Needless to say, I prepped my pan; washed, dried, added a little oil (as per instructions) and spread it evenly, allowed pan to heat for 3 minutes, removed from heat, wiped off excess oil with paper towels and it was then ready for use. I needed a smaller pan so I could cook my eggs in and everything I have is much larger.  I have only used it a couple of times so far, but, in my honest opinion, I have never had my eggs come out so beautifully before! I have never mastered the art of flipping things in a pan, however I may have to learn since I actually have a hard time flipping them over w a non-metal spatula as the eggs DO NOT STICK AT ALL!  The heat distribution seems impeccable! The pan practically cleans itself, it's SO easy to clean! As for scratch resistance, I feel as long as you do not use metal in this pan, it should remain in great condition so I have full faith that it will and, if I am at all disappointed down the road in it's performance, I will come back and add another review along with anything I might have done to cause any malfunctions so as to be open and honest about it's ""worthiness"" of the five stars I am about to give!  I LOVE THIS PAN and would buy it again and again!!!"
If I could give this pan 10 stars I would. I also have a small sauce pan and love it so I thought how could I go wrong with the fry pan. I was right. I have induction heat so its important I have a pan that can be used with this type of heat. Pan came with instructions for a quick seasoning. It was nothing more than a thin layer of oil and heat for 3 minutes. Used it immediately afterwards to make some fried eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly and just slid off. Wood style handles keep it cool so I do t have to look for mitts. This pan is very high quality and for the price it’s the best value. I am definitely going to buy more pieces in the future!
"I came across this pan while reading the news, it popped up as a side article. I went to Amazon and read the reviews, the most recent ones, checked to see if the responses were from legitimate buyers, which they were, so I bought one at a price that looked too good to be true, with todays scary inflation I went and bought one. I use it as my daily pan for cooking on my gas stove. I was so impressed with it, when I went to visit my son and his family I bought him one too!! I will be looking at slowly adding bigger pans and pots over the year. This is my second ceramic pan, bad experience on the first, different brand. I hope that all of the other products that this company makes are unparalleled quality like this pan! I will review them as I purchase them. Additional note, I don’t think I will have to buy every two years for worn out pans. The weight and quality feels lifetime lasting! If your wondering, I did not receive this to review! I am a real person with an honest opinion of this product!!"
"Update: December 5, 2021: This pan has become our go-to for omelettes, eggs small portions; we also bought the 10-inch pan since first review since this is an attractive pan, cleans well and cooks great. Moreover, There has been zero problems or issues regarding non-stick. In fact, even though we typically put a very minimal amount of oil in pan, don’t believe it’s really necessary if you heat it correctly, and sufficiently, before introducing food to surface. From watching cooking shows I’m pretty sure this is true for any brand of frying pan.  After reading negative reviews from people alleging they experienced problems with the non-stick feature, I have found NO problems whatsoever. The pan works absolutely great.  I’ve cooked eggs, omelettes and chicken tenders in the three days since I’ve had this pan. There is zero problem cleaning it afterwards; and if you heat properly (and add some oil or butter) there is NO Issues or problems with the non-stick. Also The heat is evenly dispersed, heats evenly and cooks very fast (Update: oil or butter is optional as it still is non-stick without.)  I would highly recommend this pan!"
"As soon as I removed my frying pan from the box, I washed it in warm, soapy water, then put some organic sunflower oil in the bottom of the pan. I used my silicone brush to spread the oil, then I put the pan over a low/medium heat for about 3-4 minutes, allowing the oil to cook in and season the pan, as per instructions.  Last night, I used my fryer for the first time scrambling eggs. I did not add additional oil. WOW!! It truly is nonstick! I'm sorry I didn't think about getting a pic, I can add one later, but the eggs literally slid out of the pan into the bowl. Slid! Right Out!  Use either silicone or wooden cooking utensils. Using metal or even hard plastic could diminish the life and performance of the nonstick surface.  After removing the scrambled eggs, my only cleanup was with a paper towel. I did not wash my skillet as there was really no food residue and it had just been seasoned. I will probably re-season it after every three or four uses just to make sure that it stays in new condition.  The handle did not get hot, like some people complain. I kept the handle turned away from the stove and well away from the burner. I also have a small saucepan from this maker and that handle does not give me problems with getting hot, either.  The one thing I love about this particular maker is that the entire skillet, or pan, is covered in their no stick, so I don't worry about reactive foods such as tomatoes coming in contact with the rim.  Heat distribution is even throughout the entire cooking surface. No hot or cold spots. Just wipe clean with a paper towel. If you do need heavier cleaning, if you seasoned it before use, I recommend just a plain water rinse and then wipe dry with a paper towel.  This 8"" skillet is not flimsy, it has a nice quality feel and weight. I love the wooden handle, but I'm attentive to where the handle is in relation to my burner's flame. This cookware is sturdy and mean to last a lifetime, which it will if you treat it with care and respect. I highly recommend hand washing, and to season your cookware, even your saucepans before their first use and occasionally thereafter.  One caution here, though. The 8"" skillet, which is what i""m reviewing, did not come with it's own lid. Be careful about purchasing 'universal fitting lids' that are made to fit two or three sizes of skillets and pans with the same lid, because the handles on this maker's cookware are high, which will cause a universal lid to not sit down completely on the cookware, so you'll need to buy 'to fit' lids.  I suggest that if you want to protect your no-stick coating but want to stack this cookware, as I need to as I'm a full time RV'er, to put paper towels, or small towels in the bottom of each cookware to be stacked.  Happy Cooking, Everyone! I know I'm thrilled with no longer having to scrape my food off the bottom of my cookware, or scrub it clean!! Yay!"
"Right when i got this i put it to the test day after day cooking every meal i ate. For a small size it's easy to get heat distributed all over for even cooking, and when you are finished it's just a matter of wetting the pan and wiping it down unless you put something REALLY sticky on it.  my only complaint is that the wood handle is visibly burning and charring the more you cook, so you will see it turn blacker over time.  All in all, for the price and convenience I would continually purchase this and each larger sized pan from this brand. You can't go wrong here"
"My pan arrived on time and in fantastic shape. As my headline stated...what can I say, this is a perfect pan. It cooks everything I put into it whether that be meat, pasta, vegetables..perfectly. With little oils needed. Cleaning? No issues whatsoever. I do suggest to everyone, never use metals in this pan. We only use wooden kitchen tools to cook with. No forks, knives, metal spatulas. To keep this pan in great shape, clean as gently as possible. If something does manage to stick ( we have never had an issue) have the patience to soak it in water before you feel the need to scrub away. I highly recommend this pan, very impressed."

"Since you're reading this, you're obviously concerned as to this pan's quality and what people think of their use of it. And you've likely also seen some negative reviews from the IDIOTS who think that the term ""non-stick"", means they don't need to add any form of lubricant to their cookware.  You need to use butter or oil, no matter what you use to cook your food on! Non-stick, means that it WILL NOT stick to the pan, the way food traditionally sticks to stainless steel or cast iron, even if you do use butter or oil.  If something or someone has led you to conduct your life in an ignorant manner, then don't blame the manufacturer of a product that even has it written in their instructions of use, to use butter or oil on a nonstick pan.  Just look at the picture I uploaded. It says it right there in their directions.  And I think it also goes without saying, that you never use a temperature higher than medium heat, on any kind of a non-stick pan. Whether it's ceramic or Teflon... They are intended for low heat purposes, such as eggs or bacon. If you need high heat, then uses cast iron or stainless steel.  Needless to say... My eggs and bacon slid off the pan brilliantly. And I will be buying further products from this manufacturer again."
"I got rid of my old non-stick pan and after some careful research, I chose this for its safe cooking surface. I was surprised at the generous size. I really like the option to add a lid, which I did. I'm pleased with how it cooks and how it looks. The handles on the pan and lid appear to be wood, but they're Bakelite. I do not plan to use it in the oven, so I can't say anything about how it performs there, but I can say that it is a champion on the stovetop. I heated and oiled it before use, as per the instructions, and I wash it by hand and dry it with a paper towel. I have used a wooden spoon and a Betty Crocker mixing spatula that I'm sure I got at Dollar Tree once upon a time. The spatula quickly began to melt, so I learned not to do that (note to self: you get what you pay for at Dollar Tree sometimes). I think a regular plastic spatula made for cooking (instead of spreading frosting) would be fine. It is beautiful to look at and food does not stick. I haven't used it a lot, but so far, I am very pleased and would recommend it. It came packaged well and there are care instructions included. I don't think you'll be disappointed with it. The brand is highly rated for its non-stick safety properties."
"Freakin' Finally! Seriously, I can't count all the non-stick pans I've bought over the years only to end up throwing them away because (wait for it) they weren't non-stick! Yeah, I'm a lousy cook for sure, but there should be no reason why anyone can't scramble an egg without having to scrub the remains out with a Brillo pad. Enter this baby. Just like on commercials where the chef slides a fried egg around the pan and plops it on a plate leaving the pan clean, even this idiot can do it. I don't even have to wash it; just wipe it with a damp paper towel and it's ready to go. Regret? I didn't buy a set. That's next on the list of things to do."
"I put this pan through its paces tonight. I glazed a sauce, sauteed shrimp & veggies & fried mixed veggies. I used different heats from low to high, and I cooked with oils, liquids, and sauces.  Pros: - Distributed heat very evenly even though I have one of those burners that are always slightly tilted. - Heats up fast and readjust fairly quickly when heat is lowered. Handles high heat as well as it does low heat. I had nothing scorching from random ""hot spots"" on the surface. - It's very lightweight and very sturdy. - Handle is comfortable to hold and work with. It stayed completely cool no matter what level of heat I cooked with. - The cooking surface is much smoother than I anticipated. - The sides are high and curved enough for sauteeing and turning items.  Now I did use only wooden and silicone utensils with this but it doesn't seem overly fragile. I wasn't worried about carefully using the wooden spatula to turn foods. When I was done with different foods, everything just slid so easily out of the pan and onto the serving plate.  The only oil I used was enough to coat my fingers and rub onto the cooking surface of the pan. I did use more oil later but that was for my actual recipe.  The best of all is how easy this cleans up. I treated it like my cast iron and avoided immersing it in water. I used a damp rag and wiped it thoroughly. Even though I simmered a sauce for a sticky glaze, every trace wiped right out with very little effort on my part. And I can't get over how lightweight it is.  This pan is freaking amazing. I am now looking to get the 11-inch version with a lid or a deeper one so that I can do larger amounts of sauce."
"I was attracted to the Carote pan because of the natural granite coating. I’ve gone through about every other “coated” pan trying to avoid unnatural applications. [None of them ever stood up to their promises.] When I unpacked the Carote its rough surface concerned me. “This will never be non-stick!” I’m vegan [so I’m not looking for eggs to slide out of the pan onto toast] and usually do dry sautés, occasionally adding water if needed, so I was looking for a pan that would truly allow that to happen. Now I was very concerned and developing “buyers’ remorse.” When I applied oil to the pan for seasoning it, I marveled at how readily the oil soaked into the granite. I thought, “Maybe this is going to work?” I dry sautéed some tofu and the pan cleaned up perfectly. Not a hint of struggle. I don’t normally write reviews but there were so many unfavorable ones where folks found their Carote pan to be sticking. [Maybe the pan wasn't seasoned before the first use?] For me, and my style of cooking, I might have just found the pan of my dreams! [With a handle the likes of which I’ve never experienced - beautifully crafted.] Thank you, Carote."
"Well, I guess the description said that the coating was made in Switzerland. I have not used the skillet yet, so I will reserve judgement on its performance and update this review later. I just found the description very misleading. Disappointed. But now the price makes sense. Product info on packaging is conflicted as well. Front says not suitable for oven. Online description says, ""Oven safe to 350 degrees F."" Update: Love this little skillet. Went ahead and ordered the larger 10"" with glass lid as Christmas gifts to my kids. Great buys. I use this omelet skillet almost daily. Holding up great. Labeling was still messed up. But product is great."
"I did not realize I could love a frying pan. Until this one arrived in the mail. I was lucky to get this one on one of Amazon daily sales specials. I got the 10 inch pan. The minute I took it out of the box I knew that I had a quality piece of cookware in my presence.  The handle of the pan is so impressive. The wood has this feeling to it that is very nice. It's almost undescribable actually. No matter what I'm cooking on the stove the handle does not get hot no matter what. And it's very comfortable to hold.  I followed the directions that came with the pan. On how to ""season"" the pan. Following those directions is important. IMO. The pen is so easy to cook with, and keep clean. No matter what I cook with I usually have to just take a few paper towels to wipe it out and it looks as good as new. When I clean it with hot soapy water I use a soft sponge. Don't let the look of the pan fool you. It is definitely nonstick.  Certain items I do put a quick swipe of oil or something like pam. Depending on what I'm cooking.  The heat distribution is fabulous.  The bottom of the pan looks as good as when I got it out of the box. It does not have any scorch marks or what have you on it  I am planning on buying more pans in different sizes."
"I was surprised by the quality of this skillet. I had bought another brand of ""granite"" skillet at a discount store on the ""as advertised on TV aisle"" and thought it was alright but I also wanted an 8"" skillet but could only find 10"" and 12"" ones at the stores. I saw this one on Amazon, read the good reviews, the price was right, and ordered it. It was heavier and had a better, more solid feel than the 10"". The ""granite"" coating on it also looked thicker. I have used it regularly for several months and it still looks almost new while the other brand skillet has turned so dark it looks like regular Teflon. The Carote skillet cooks better and cleans up easier than the other brand. You can't go wrong with this little skillet."
"I've never tried a pan with this kind of coating, usually preferring stainless steel, but I thought I'd give it a try. So far it's been perfect; it cleans up well, it has a nice weight and heats evenly, and I love the handle.  One thing that I hate in a frying pan is if the bottom isn't flat, which is what happens to all the cheap ones. So far so good on this one - I use it on a glass-topped stove and it's dead-flat still. At one point I was frying some chicken and got called away for about 45 minutes, during which the oil burned off, the pan got very hot and the kitchen filled with smoke (stupid me, I know). Cleaning up afterward was still a breeze, a little soak in soapy water and the black came right off, pan still looks like new, and still dead-flat."
"After agreeing to replace defective pan--crack in the handle where pan is attached- they did not do so. In fact, they ignored email reminding them that they had promised to replace as soon as stock was replenished due to Covid 19 delays. Save your money and buy something else. Yes, the pans are beautiful and easy to clean, but are defective."
"Upon arrival, I cleaned the pan with warm soapy water, rinsed thoroughly, dried completely. Then lightly oiled the entire inner surface of the pain with olive oil, placed the pan on my glass top stove at medium temp for 3-5 min to 'season' it. Then wiped excess oil out of the pain with a paper towel. I cracked 3 large eggs into preheated pan w/o adding any additional oil. Cooked on medium-high for 5 min. Eggs lifted easily on the edges with a gentle lift using a silicone spatula and slide out of the pan and onto a plate with no problem. I wiped the pain with a paper towel and voila! I highly recommend this pan. If you follow the prep/cook/care instructions to a t, then you should be very happy with the results. I know I am.💯🍳"
"I've been using this pan for a few weeks now and so far am pleased with the non-stick quality. You would assume at first that the rough granite surface wouldn't be good for non-stick, but it actually works good. I make a lot of scrambled eggs, and even when I stir in cheese, there is no sticking. I have mostly been using a little butter or oil which I think helps, but it also works fine without it. Another tip: keep the heat med-low to med-high. I think that's good for the pan lifespan. Cleanup is very easy, I can practically get it clean just wiping with a paper towel. Overall, I'm satisfied with this pan, and will probably order a larger size. The 8"" size is perfect for 2-3 scrambled eggs or 2 fried eggs."
"Wow! Love this pan! Got it yesterday and as of right now best pan I've ever had! I fried up some zucchini and then cooked up cheese raviolis. The zucchini turned out awesome! A lil cripy here and there..just how I like it! I remember reading a specific review where the person made up eggs and they stuck on HOWEVER they did NOT use oil. The instructions SPECIFICALLY say to put oil in the pan while heating it up. Their review in my opinion isn't valid when they don't follow instructions. If you don't use oil I'd say this isn't the pan for you. I personally use a lot of healthy oils..avocado, olive and sometimes grapeseed and coconut. I'm sure you can heat things up that don't require oil (or already has oil in it..such as heating up leftovers). I understand some people don't use oil but good luck in finding a healthy pan that doesn't require a lil oil. Also as with most ALL pans you really shouldn't have it on super high heat (unless one is boiling water). I'm hoping I won't have to edit my review because I'd be upset if it turns out it doesn't hold up for a bit. I'm careful with my pan. I use a lot of wood utensils and silicone for cooking in non stick pans. I also recommend NOT using any metal utensils with this pan. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I am! Oh and the plus...it looks great!"
"Just do not forget to season it first with plenty of oil.  Yes, this skillet needs to be once warmed up with plenty of oil. However strange it sounds, the oil somehow permeates the surface, after which the skillet becomes as non-stick as they claim it to be. I use the skillet to fry eggs which do not stick at all, instead, they just slide around. From time to time I add a drop of oil, literally one drop, and the skillet works just fine."
"I was searching for an effective, PPE-free product and this one was recommended. It is nice weight, but most impressive is that it has an additional metal disk on the bottom to improve heating.  I cooked some egg beaters with cheese in my pan this morning, giving it a very light coating of oil. Voila! No sticking, no mess, and cleaned up easily.  Of course, I do hand wash all of my pots and pans, to insure they live as long as possible.  One area that I was not sure about and that's the usage of olive oil in this pan. Many ceramic pans do NOT recommend the usage of olive oil (perhaps because of lower smoke point and possible sticking?). I did not use such, but it would be great if the product description included guidance in this matter.  So far, and very happy with my purchase (the price was great too). Will update this comment after 6 months of use."
Well ... first I just want to mention that the pan was shipped to me unwrapped in just a plain padded envelope ... that's not any reflection on the product but by the shipper ... seems to be asking for trouble but it thankfully did arrive safe and sound ... Back to the product ... I read every review possible ... good and bad ... and carefully followed every instrucion on the package before and after first use .... and I must say that I'm impressed .... looks great ... cooks perfectly ... my fried egg did absolutely slide around and off the pan (I did use butter) .... and cleaned up good as new ... again .. this was my first use ... I will certainly update if I feel any differently ... so far so good ... happy with my purchase ...
"I don't cook, and I don't like to clean up either! I bought this pan because it was among the lesser priced and it had really good reviews. The other reviewers were right. NOTHING sticks to it. The pan heats evenly and produces great scrambled eggs which slide right out. It's a breeze to clean. I use a couple of drops of detergent on a sponge to clean it. The small opening at the end of the handle is a bit of a challenge to hook onto my hanging rack, but it is a small price to pay for such a great pan. I'm thinking about getting a complete set. Very pleased."
"I bought this to replace my old granite style bamboo pan as I had a cheaper lidless one that I bought in-store that fell and broke that I needed to replace.  This pan is good, I have an old gas range stove that has poor heat distribution, and this pan compensates a little for that, as I noticed it usually heats/cooks evenly. This cooks well, as good as my old pan, the lid is nice as this was about the price I paid in store for a similar pan. Though the lid slides a little, it’s not a problem. I use this daily, and it doesn’t burn like my copper coat ones do, making it easy to clean."
After reading lots of great reviews on these pans I bought three different sized ones. I just haven’t figured out where the non stick part comes in. I’ve tried to fry eggs several different times and at different temperatures. The eggs stick like glue. I can put a little butter or pam in before the eggs and then the pans do okay. These are definitely non non stick. My cast iron pans cook eggs better and stick less. Cleaning the burnt stuck on eggs is easy though. After I put the pan in water.
"I have a long history of buying, then hating, omelette pans. LeCreuset, Calphalon, Revereware - you name it. I meticulously prep them, follow instructions to the letter, and end up with unintentionally scrambled eggs and a stuffed swear jar.  But wait… this pan, this somewhat inexpensive pan, made a perfect omelette. Sure I did my part but that has never before been enough.  Oh, and although if you do it right, the wood handle has nothing to do with how the omelette turns out but it sure is pretty and comfortable to hold.  This pan makes me very happy."
"I purchased the 8-inch frying pan as an emergency replacement for our beloved Dansk fry pan that my husband used for many years to make perfect eggs. That pan finally ""gave up the ghost,"" and he was complaining about it. This pan was really inexpensive and promised fast delivery, so I ordered it. I figured ""what the heck"" because if it didn't work out, I wouldn't be out a lot of money. The pan was delivered Tuesday afternoon, and that evening my husband washed it and seasoned it per the instructions. Made eggs in it on Wednesday morning and pronounced it to be an amazing pan. Made eggs in it again this morning, and again they were perfect. My husband is so happy, and I'm happy that I get served perfect eggs."
"A two hundred dollar non-stick pan needs oil, butter, or something to keep anything truly non-stick. No exception here. So far, this pan is working great after everyday use for a month. No warps, no sticking, and if you have gas you'll have good even cooking. Not so much with electric burners. As with most non-stick, try to avoid high heat for prolonged times. Heat your pan first, use EVOO,or butter, put your food in the pan and don't move it around until it cooks a little. Then flip and so on. I 've bought $90 Cuisinart non-stick pans and they last about 2 years, so we'll see how this Granite Stone pan holds up over time."
"Great nonstick pan. Not as heavy as a cast-iron skillet, but a little more weighted then a light aluminum pan. Absolutely nothing sticks inside of these pans and they look great as well. Would love to have a whole set of these. And there is no coating that will peel off eventually as so many high-end nonstick cookware does. Which is so much more healthy and safe.Absolutely love the pan."
"I purchased the 11 inch skillet, received it yesterday and cooked a meal in it later in the day. No care instructions or any other information were included with it. I Googled ""Carote care instructions"" & found little available for this particular brand, only generic information. I washed it in hot soapy water, dried and spread a thin coat of oil over the interior, and let it heat on a medium low gas flame for about 5 minutes in order to season it a bit. Later, I cooked a taco ground beef/rice dinner in it and clean up was a breeze. After drying, I applied another thin coat of oil and put it away until next time. So far, so good."
"Of course, I've used dozens of different kinds of pans in my day but this particular pan is made with some serious metallurgy design thought. Works exceptionally well at cooking eggs and pan fried chicken. The metal composition retains the heat very well ....whether that is a low or low-mid range heat input...it retains and distributes the heat evenly. It cooks much better than many pans of my past. Even better than a $50 hard anodized pan. I love this frying pan. My next pan will be this particular make/model."
"El sarten es un gran producto. Quise esperar un tiempo de uso para escribir esta opinión Si se mantienen ciertos cuidados tales como: dejar enfriar para lavar, utilizar una esponja y detergentes suaves, no restregar, usar paletas de madera o silicona para revólver los alimentos resulta ser un aliado excelente Coloco solo un chorlito de aceite y así evito que se dañe cuando voy a colocar algún alimento, aunque podría decir que no haría falta simplemente por precaución Espero comprar otros utensilios de esta línea, estoy muy orgullosa de mi compra"
There is a lot to like about this skillet. Price is very good compared to some other options. I especially like the handle. It is very solid and has good weight to it. This skillet heats up faster than my old non stick skillet did. Heat is evenly distributed and nothing sticks to the pan. I cannot evaluate if this skillet will last a long time as I've only had the skillet for about a week. So far I'm very pleased with my purchase. If needed I'll come back and update my review after I've used this skillet for a while.
"I bought numerous nonstick style pans over the years and maybe get 6 months out of them. Everything from copper chef to diamond and always had problems with edges chipping and clean up not as easy. This pan is amazing!!! Heats up fast, cooks evenly, can char the crap out of some thing if I want and the crud easily cleaned off!!!! So far after a month have no signs of edges of chipping but I will say definitely watch the handle near heat. I still use a little spray Pam when cooking eggs and just a dollop of olive oil evenly wiped across the bottom for all other foods. I got all these in every size no regrets so far. Love them!!!!!!!!!"
"It's my first experience with this so-called granite non-stick, but it works well. If you're buying it to flip eggs directly in the pan -- that is, without a spatula -- it's less than perfect -- the side slope is a bit steep. I've managed it, but I also have a more traditional, induction-ready egg pan. If you don't flip your eggs/omelettes using the just pan (toss and flip) it's an excellent egg pan. It's also excellent for sauteing veggies and such -- here the steeper sides help with flipping the veggies or whatever you're browning/frying. The fake wood handle has just the right amount of grip and is is beautifully fitted to the pan. For me, it's a keeper. The price is right."
"I was amazed to seee that it actually is a non stick pan when I used it. The surface appearance throws you off with what seemingly is a rough surface though it’s really actually smooth . Works superb! The handle is just an extra bonus - the wood is made well and sturdy. I actually now prefer this kind of pan and will be purchasing more in the future. Definitely recommend! Update: Just bought a 2nd one - the 12 inch, and I was amazed at how huge it is. Not just in circumference but also the height is a bit taller than others I’ve used. The quality cannot be beat!"
"So real talk, I was nervous about buying the span because of the price. I ended up buying it because I knew the pan that we had that we use all the time to cook was warped and the nonstick was terrible plus it was Teflon and we are getting a new feathered friend and they can't be around Teflon or any sort of nonstick cookware like that. I started using the frying pan a smaller one like this and I was shocked by how when I went to cook eggs they slid right off. I did season it according to directions the first time and following times after and I am currently cooking ground beef in this pan and it is cooking so beautifully it's not burning and I have my heat on low and it is cooking just perfectly! Nothing is sticking to the bottom it is a beautiful pan feels very sturdy and looks a lot more expensive than it was totally would buy this again"
"Besides the point, that this is the prettiest pan I have ever seen and the unbeatable price, this pan is absolutely great! I will most definitely buy all the other sizes too! It is super easy to clean, cooks evenly, gets hot super fast, the handle feels great and it's not heavy at all! It has just the right weight to it and the handle is super smooth and soft. My husband could not even tell that the handle isn't real wood at first. It's a very high quality pan that everyone should have in their kitchen! Absolutely gets 5 stars from me! Highly recommend!!!"
"Recently I have been making lots of omelettes with fresh eggs from my chickens and I wasn’t sure I’d like this pan, or that it would work ok considering the low price point. But I decided to try it, and I love it. Makes a great cheese cracker, and a great omelette. It is a bit too bumpy for a good crepe, so I wouldn’t use it for that. But excellent for omelettes. It does pop when it is cooling, but so far there has been no damage to the material, and it washes easily. It looks very cute as well."
"It’s a $15 frying pan, honestly, I can’t complain. I needed a pan when I first moved out, and this fit the bill. I never learned how to cook, so this little pan saw some tears, burnt bacon, and stuck on who knows what. It’s been 9 months, and honestly—I’m a better cook now. I’ve learned to love my pans, and finally got a set that I won’t abuse. This pan did everything I needed, and worked for a first time cook. Did it scratch? Yes. Does it look new? No. It’s a frying pan, it adds flavor."
"I've had this for a couple months now, and it's been terrific. My old pan had become an ""everything sticks"" pan, and cleaning it after cooking just about anything was a huge pain. Nothing sticks to this one, and you can clean it after each use in seconds.  I can't speak to how well it would perform for serious culinary work, but for a home cook who just needs a good frying pan for everyday cooking, this is amazing for the price."
"Honestly this pan is amazing. for 8 bucks too, this is a steal. the non-stick doesn't scratch easily, and it indeed is non-stick. Great weight and handle. I think a lot of times people over think what cooking ware they need to get, like it needs to be expensive (like buying a kitchenAid product...ugh such a waste of money), when actually things like this are fabulous too."
"Before I purchased this frying pan I was restricted to cold meals or microwaveable products that were probably poisonous. Even if I wanted to cook, my skills at cookery were utterly atrocious, if not diabolical. In short, I cooked worse than any line cook at a Buffalo Wild Wings.  After I purchased this frying pan, I became a Michelin Star Chef. I could fry up dishes that would make Gordon Ramsay taciturn. Guy Fieri would gladly buy a first class ticket to flavor town if he could take even the smallest bite of one the dishes I was creating.  This frying pan changed my life. I found love on Match.com without even posting a photo of my face, I just took a photo of my food.  Tony Robbins and Gary Vee swear by this frying pan. This combined with cold showers at 5am will make you an instant billionaire. This is the secret that Rhonda Byrne still won’t shut up about.  Buy yours now! You will not regret it! Operators are standing by!"
Love how heavy it is. Feels durable. Thick bottom. Heat distributes evenly. Everything from eggs to salmon slide right out of the pan. Make sure you get silicone cooking utentils to cook with.
"I read some reviewers said nothing sticks to this, so I was under the impression I could make scrambled eggs but it sticks. of course that is remedied by adding a little butter or little oil first. but I was under the impression it would not stick without those things, so I was just slightly disappointed because so far it functions just like any other$12 frying pan I could buy it at a local store, but this is well-built and sturdy and everything about it feels high quality my only complaint is unless you use cooking oil or butter or something things can stick to it"
"You simply cannot go wrong with this Utopia pan, for the money; sure, there are others out there that cost 3-4 times as much, but none of those products (I've bought a number the high ends), will out perform this pan. It cooks even, for edge to edge, non stick is superb, cleans up very easily and has performed flawlessly, with daily use now for over 8 months. As with all nonstick pans, be careful not to use anything but nonstick utensils and be careful not to stack in dishwasher or dry rack, with nonstick side touching metal of abrasive objects; with those things in mind, you will not go wrong with the performance of this Utopia pan."
Cheap price. But rubbed out after one year. Cheap enough to buy again but I can't say product is high quality.
This was the best Nonstick Frying Pan for its reasonable price that I have ever purchased. I am complete satisfied and would recommend this pan to anyone looking for a good nonstick pan.
"This is a great pan. The photo shows the surface condition after 7 months of daily use. (Small amount of scratching visible but performance is the same as the first day I used it.) I am impressed with the durability and am ordering a 2nd (I always keep 2 non-stick skillets on hand.) I've used T-Fal skillets since 2012 and used to be quite pleased with their quality, but that quality has diminished in the last few years and I threw my last T-Fal away and this is a better replacement for half the price."
"I really like this pan; In fact, when we got a new set of pots and pans, I kept this one and got rid of everything else. However, I had been noticing a plastic-y film on my glass stovetop every once in a while and couldnt figure out where it was coming from. Apparently, something has peeled off the bottom of this pan and is transferring to the cooktop (looks like a ring from the pan bottom). Im using easy off to try to clean off the bottom and see if thay resolves the problem. But, user beware."
"It's a pan. How much is there to say? Actually, if there's a stand-out feature to it, that would be that the handle was attached correctly. The pan I was replacing (different brand) would let water into the handle at the rivets while in the dish washer and then leak out onto the range top the next time I cooked with it. This one is solidly constructed, no water problems."
Ordered this pan after reading the positive reviews. Never expected it to be so nice! Not at all flimsy and the handle does not get hot. It looks like a much more expensive pan and i am very happy with it.
"I have started using induction cooking more and more, but I don't have a lot of induction cookware. I needed a non-stick pan, so I ordered this one. Very nice pan. It is not cheaply made, it has some weight to it and chances are good that it will last awhile. If you're looking for a non-stick, induction frying pan, this one would be a good choice."
"I wanted to wait a few months before writing a review because I have been burned (figuratively, of course!) by “nonstick” pans. You know the kind....on tv they put a slice of cheese in the thing and twirl it around like it’s floating on air. Those always left me wondering what I was doing wrong. Well, four months later and nothings sticking!  I have treated this one like I was probably supposed to have with the other ones...wash it out with only soft things, like a paper towel or sponge. And no metal spatulas. Don’t need them because nothing sticks anyway. Well worth what we paid for it. Would buy again but don’t need to because, as you know, nothing has stuck! Ta Da!"
Excellent non-stick pan! Very easy to clean. The handle does transfer a small amount of heat through the plastic so be careful of that. Aside from this there are no issues!  Also the pan is deep enough for most dishes but if you like to have a fuller/more robust dish with tons of vegetables simmering and marinating then you'll need something deeper than this. I recently cooked a meatball soup (it was portioned for 2 people so I didn't use a standard pot) and all of the ingredients barely fit. Something to keep in mind!
"I first bought a Utopia sauce pan. Nothing stuck to that thing. Cleaning anything was a breeze. So then I decided to buy this frying pan. Same great experience.  Just bought these products, so not sure how long they will last. But so far they work great, and do seem sturdier than other non-stick products I've bought in the past that ended up peeling and having to be disposed of prematurely."
"Bought this as secondary pan for my cast iron. Its used mostly for light duty, like over easy eggs or grilled cheese when the other pan is in use. With light use and non-metal utensils this pan has held up very well and has not lost its anti stick properties since purchase."
"My wife bought a pan at a home and garden show that cost significantly more and was worthless a few month later. So I said why not try one from amazon. Well this pan has performed flawlessly never sticking without the use of oils or non stitch aerosol. One year later and still my go to pan. Her 150$ pan, we donated it and hope no one is cursing us."
This frying pan is great! It was only about 16.00 but it doesn’t stick!!!!!!!I think so far We have it for 2 months!!It doesn’t stick!!!Its worth the money!!!!!!
"The first thing I made in this pan were some scrambled eggs to test the nonstick abilities. I was blown away at the results. All remains wiped off with a single swipe of a dry paper towel, and the eggs came out great. I have used this pan several times by now and have noticed no wearing down of the nonstick coating. I bought this pan after getting so frustrated at my Blue Diamond ""nonstick"" pan that I threw it straight from the stovetop into the trash. After quickly purchasing this pan afterwards, I can easily say that was a great decision."
"I first purchased this pan in September of 2018. And it’s lasted me a year and a half! It’s April of 2020, and I’m back for more! It lasted a long time - and I use this pan every, single day - multiple times a day! I’m ordering a couple more, and definitely recommend this pan!"
I love this pan. I use it almost every day. It cleans easily and is nice and flat on the bottom (which is good for my glass cooktop). I try to hand wash as much as possible—rather than using the dishwasher. It’s been probably about 4-5 months so far and I would buy this brand again.
"My previous 10"" pan was small on the induction plate. This pan fits nicely and seems to cook faster, probably because the bottom plate is better matched to the induction coil. Coating is holding up well after 1 month, but time will tell. Last pan lasted 10 years of careful use. I wish I had ordered a lid with it."
"Only thing I dislike is the fact they wear out. All Teflon pans wear out in about 1 year from my everyday use, this pan seems to last longer then others I've used though and will be the next I buy too. Love it!"
I wanted a T Fal but couldn't justify that much money.  This pan has held up very well and is an excellent value.  It's a little heavier than T Fal but not enough to be a deal breaker.  Would buy again.
"For the price, and even when compared to non-stick frying pans double the price, this pan delivers! We've had this pan for 2 years in March 2020 and it's still going strong with almost daily use. Sure the non-stick surface isn't what it was when we bought it, but it's still non-stick. Others that we've had never made it a year and that goes for T-Fal brand as well. You need to clean these pans right after use and dry them immediately as well - as with all non-stick. You won't be disappointed!"
"I am so pleasantly surprised by this pan. My previous non stick pan had ceased to be non stick quite a long time ago and I was sick of having to soak it and then scrub for ages to get it clean. This pan was lightweight, easy to use, cooked items evenly, and was a breeze to clean up."
I am incredibly happy with this Frying Pan. The nonstick surface is excellent and it has proved to be durable so far. I am sure I have already good 150 meals in it.  It gets hand washed and air dried after every use and never goes in teh dish washer. So far it is pristine with good care. And I almost never use even a tiny spray of oil.
I’ve designated this pan for eggs only and so far it’s been great! Cooks them perfectly and doesn’t stick. I still coat it with oil so I’m not sure if it’s a miracle pan but it works great if used right. Awesome price too.
"We are using it to fry eggs, does a good job of doing so without any oil. The pan is heavy and well balanced and the handle is strong and sturdy."
"I recently received my Utopia 11 inch nonstick frying pan, and I was impressed by how well-made it was. It's very sturdy, the handle is riveted onto the pan instead of screwed on like most of the pans I have (all have, over time come unscrewed) and the bottom induction system makes the food cook very evenly. I highly recommend this pan!"
"So far so good with this pan. I needed a new nonstick pan for eggs, etc, and this one has been great so far. Hopefully it holds up well, as I really like how it cooks and heats up. I use a gas stove. Pan heats up quickly and it seems to have even heat across the cooking surface."
Loved it. Very sturdy yet light weight. Easy to clean as it is nonstick. Durability? Not sure. It got scratched when someone used a metal utensil on it and will probably have to throw it out in a year or so.
I just received my new pan. It works very well. Have used it several times and everything slides off like it's supposed to. I am treating it gently by not exposing it to extreme temperatures or temperature changes and don't use metal utensils. I hope it will last a while. Thank you!
"I bought this to use with a Duxtop Portable Induction Cooktop, Countertop Burner, Induction Burner with Timer and Sensor Touch, 1800W 8500ST E210C2.  However, when I first tried to use it, the Duxtop flashed code ""E0"" which the manual says means that the pan isn't compatible with induction cooktops.  UPDATE: the burner was broken, not the pan."
"Ordered this to use with an induction plate. Have not used it yet, but sure it will be fine. Seems to be good quality."
"The whole family loves using this new pan. Eggs, veggies, sauces - we use it every day, multiple times a day. It cleans off completely simply by running it under water most of the time."
This pan is exactly what I needed. It is lightweight and easy to clean. Note that I typically apply a generous squirt of olive oil to nearly everything before cooking to help protect the pan. I've been using it frequently for several months and love it.
"Best frying pan in my cupboard. I can’t speak to its durability at this point, as I haven’t had it long enough, but, after 10 or more uses, it looks as good as when I opened its box."
"Excellent pan with an even better price. I was skeptical about the price, but the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. Pan is thick and heavy. Feels much better quality than inexpensive pans that you would find in the big box stores. Holds up to high heat and heats nice and evenly. I would and probably will buy again."
"non stick don't last forever, so its always good to get a cheaper one, and this one is great. First one lasted about a year."
"So far, this pan has been great for sautéing foods, etc. I do still have to use a little oil but not much. I love how easy this pan is to clean."
"I have used this pan for several months, this pan is very good, cheap, but works very well. The only problem is that they do not provide a cover, you need to buy another pan cover if you need."
"I'm the cook in the house and have gone through a lot of ""non-stick"" pans which have disappointed me time after time. , I buy this low cost pan, and eggs just slide around like they are slick on ice. Amazing! But, I've only used it this first time. See what happens with age. Hope it stays this way!!!"
"Pretty good, for a cheap pan. I bought a # of induction-ready pans when I bought my new induction range, which I LOVE. Too early to tell about this one's durability, but so far, so good."
"Was tired of my old, worn pan. Got this as a replacement and am very pleased! It cleans easily."
"My last frying pan was a joke and not an especially amusing one. Everything stuck to it, well, it was gross. So far I've used this about seven times and it's great - nothing sticks, easy/breezy to clean, and I'm very happy with it."
"After getting very frustrated with huge differences in price and varied reviews on almost every pan, I opted for a cheap, basic pan. It works so well! Have had it about a month or so and we use 4 to 5 times a week. It definitely is non-stick and works like a dream. We allow it to cool before washing and hand wash and towel dry immediately. I suspect this will last longer than I anticipated and so glad I did not buy a very expense pan now."
I just ordered another exactly like this. This is exa6what I was looking for and was concerned about the quality because of the excellent price but I'm very pleased!
"I use this skillet at least once or twice a week. I love it! The mail thing you should know if you purchase it is that you are not supposed to use higher than medium heat or the teflon can come off. I have to adjust some recipes that call for Medium high heat and cook them a little longer, but the ease of clean-up is worth it to me."
"This is such an amazing pan, not too big, not too small and super easy to clean. I’d recommend buying more than one. You can’t beat the price!"
"I've never found a non stick pan that will last a lifetime, it just doesn't exist. Buy this, use for 2 years or so, replace. For the price, it's perfect, nice size, great non stick, and when it's lived it's life, you toss and don't feel the least bit bad."
"Great price, and works very well as a nonstick pan! Have used it for many different types of food and has held up amazingly well!"
"I’ve only used once, so can’t rate durability. Works great and just wiped out and stored away when finished. Cooks evenly, which I haven’t found in other frying pans that say good for induction cooking."
Great for every day use. I would suggest a matching glass cover and it would be the perfect purchase for an induction cooker
"The ""Utopia"" Kitchen 11 Inch Nonstick Frying Pan is Great! ""Easy to Clean"", ""Light Weight"", ""Durability"" and a very good Price!"
"Easy to clean and lightweight. Overall happy with the pan. It makes food go from ""I can make you sick for being raw"" to ""This is well cooked. Good job ole sport""."
"Works great on my induction top, nonstick coating is holding up nicely. Wish it had a lid, but you get what you pay for I guess"
I was surprised at the quality of this fry pan. The non-stick coating somehow seems harder than others I've owned and worn out. I would recommend this fry pan.
This was worth the money. So far nothing sticks and super easy to clean. Always use a plastic spatula.
"Replaced my older (worn out, and more expensive) nonstick pan with this one, and am happy so far. The nonstick coating seems to stay on pretty well - haven't noticed any scratches yet. Good side for scrambling a few eggs, or searing some fish/steaks for 2."
I bought this on a whim when my tfal pan’s handle broke. This wipes the floor with tfal. Cheap price. Outstanding quality. My food has never been cooked better. Surprising for a no name brand frying pan. I’d buy the whole collection if I didn’t already have tfal stocked in my cabinet.
Nice size pan just when I need nonstick
Perfect size and weight for medium size jobs - party of one your dinner is ready !!!
first one I received was horribly bent. I requested an exchange and the 2nd one was fine. good pan
"The frying pan I'm replacing, and the ones I'll be replacing in the near future, are all small in the inside. By that, I mean that my old pans have ""curved"" sides which take away from the floor of the pan. This one has substantially less curvature which increases the cooking surface."
"I bought this after burning my hand for the nth time on an Ikea frying pan handle. The insulated handle is great. Also, no need to constantly play with screws on the handle coming loose. Hope to use this for a long time."
"This is a perfect and sturdy medium sized pan perfect for grilled cheese and eggs, bacon too. It is so easy to clean and oven proof it says! I haven't tried it in the oven yet."
"Good, inexpensive pan. Arrived promptly."
"The reviews were horrible on both Blue and Swiss Diamond pans - chipping, paint peel and they contain PTFE which is not disclosed but is noted in the packaging once you open it. I decided not to use this for my daughters XMAS gift and unwrapped it. I bought a T-fal brand Tutanium - My years of experience proved that T-fal is dependable quality.. I feel Blue Diamond is deceiving its customers with their ads. I will abou those. T-Fal also has a sapphire impreganted finish that is more bio friendly and of excellent quality which I bought for myself fo Induction use - only Swiss diamond has induction versions but the quality still is poor."
"10 days later, despite utmost care, scratches are already visible, sides are bending. Poor quality product. Have to admit, it looks good. Wonder how it got such reviews!"
"Are they kidding?!? I got these pans on Christmas Day and here it is New Years Eve and already they're chipped! (See photos) I've used this pan twice with a plastic spatula and ran it through the dishwasher twice. As you can see there are now chips inside the pan and the edges of this ""diamond"" coating are already flaking off. The entire sales pitch for Blue Diamond is a SHAM! This should be illegal. Spread the word! Never again."
"I am updating my previous review  within a few months more and more things began to stick and of these many were difficult to wash clean  today was the final straw, starting with a perfectly clean pan I started cooking four eggs on low heat, within minutes half of the eggs were stuck to the bottom of the pan and could not be scraped loose with the nylon spatula I was using  So I dumped the whole mess into the sink, and started scrubbing the pan. 15min later I finally was able to call the pan clean  so much for non-stick and easy to clean up  just don't waste you money  Really annoyed customer"
The product had food stuck on it within days of using. The handle can burn anyone grasping skittle to remove from stove-I have never experienced a product that is dangerous like this
"For the past 20 years, I have used only some of the most expensive pots and pans offered in America. They're great. Guaranteed for life. But a friend of mine that occasionally uses them has complained about their heft. So I saw an ad for Blue Diamond and bought one, put it thru the paces, eggs, burnt cheese, meat. After a week, I was so happy I ordered three more pieces. The expensive stuff has been put away. The real test will be to see whether the non-stick deteriorates over time. But for the present, color me surprised! UPDATE: Non-stick lasted exactly 15 months. I bought another because they are so inexpensive and work well for a year."
"The first time I used it, thing stuck to it. Then each time thereafter even after extensive cleaning, things stuck in the same places as the first time. In addition the handle gets hot---to hot to handle without a pot holder. I would not buy this product again."
The handle gets as hot as the pan......  Back to the drawing board on this one.
"When my wife received the pan she took it out and cleaned it and the first thing she did was cook bacon & eggs, my favorite. After cooking the bacon she simply wiped it out with a paper towel and cooked the eggs. I like mine scrambled with cheese and sure enough there was no sticking or burning. She wiped it clean and even tried to burn some cheese in the pan to see if it would stick. It slid right out of the pan after turning black and smoking the kitchen up. I would recommend this pan to anyone and the cost is a steal at what we paid."
The handle takes in all the heat and if you don’t grab for a mitt first you will be burned. Learned this the hard way. Never had a pan that did this before.
"I've been using two of these pans for two months. They have the most durable non-stick finish I have encountered. I've used other ceramic and non-stick pans. These are the best yet. They conduct heat evenly and have a flat bottom heating surface. Cleans up in an instant. I cook eggs and bacon in these pans. Anything that burns on, pushes right off with a plastic spatula. A small (1/2) teaspoon of butter insures my ""over easy"" eggs come out perfectly. The pans are light aluminum. The handles are durable. They washing has made no change to them. I wash them every day in the dishwasher. I use and electric ceramic top stove so I have no issues with the handles getting hot. Again, they heat very evenly. The finish isn't indestructible. I stack the pans, and that chips the finish on the top edge, but that's about it. I never use metal utensils on non-stick pans. That's just asking for trouble. The problem I've seen in other pans is the finish breaks down/dulls over time with heating and washing. Not these pans. The pan finish is as good as the day I bought it. I'd highly recommend these Blue Diamond pans base on my actual daily use for the last two months."
"While I didn't really didn't consider the non-toxicity of the product as a selling point, the first time I used it I was happy it was non-toxic because it wouldn't add to the toxicity from my cooking abilities. I received my pan with no scratches or blemishes - it's beautiful. You just can't use metal utensils if you want your non-stick pan to remain unscratched. If you don't mind sctratches, go ahead and use metal utensils. Almost all coatings do not bind with the metal surface, they just adhere to the metal surface. The point being is that even if you refrain from using metal utensils, if a small piece flakes off, it is not unusual. But so far, my pan remains unscratched. I am very happy with the purchase of this product and would recommend it to anyone. Finally, the aluminum pan and ceramic coating do not expand and contract at the same rate. Therefore, I would strongly urge that before you rinse or wash this pan when it is hot off the stove, let the pan cool off for five or so minutes. I would also recommend that the manufacturer listen to their customers. However, based on my experience, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
"I didn't use it. After all the hype about how indestructible it was, it arrived scratched! I sent it back."
"I like these pans very much. It is NOT a scam and some reviews state. Also, ever hear of an oven mitt? They are for hot handles that come out of ovens. If you have to use an oven mitt for stove top, then you have used too high a heat. My first purchase was the 9.5 and 11 inch diameter. My second purchase (12 piece set) was from a big box store. Buyers need to read the instructions on what oil to use and how to refurbish them if they loose their non-stick qualities. Use the internet to find a high smoke point oil. NOT olive oil. I use corn oil or avocado. I will take these over stainless any day of the week. No pan will last a lifetime. I use one every day. Use low heat. If you want to use high heat for a seer, then use a cast iron skillet."
"The pan is good. It is truly nonstick. But like anything else, use it correctly (if the instructions say do not use over medium heat, and you must cook on high…don’t use this pan). If you don’t follow the instructions, you cannot expect the pan to work well for you. The first one I owned, I didn’t bother reading the instructions. My mistake. I ended up burning the inside of the pan. Also, if you want to put it in the dishwasher, only do so on the top shelf. It will ruin the pan if you wash it on the bottom (i know as I’ve lived it!). Be nice to the pan and it will last a lifetime. It is ultimately your choice. If you want a very good quality pan that you can use to cook cheeses scrambled eggs and then have no scrubbing at cleanup time, this is the pan. Also make sure to use the correct utensils. Almost any that are not metal would be fine. I’ve used nylon, silicon, and wooden utensils and no scratches. That is basically it. I recommend the product, heck I own 3 in different sizes!! Go get yours and have fun cooking!!"
"I've been making eggs over-easy for about 45 years. There's NOTHING easy about flipping an egg with this pan. See the photo. Absolutely the most useless frying pan I've ever owned. Probably tried this thing about 10 times and the diamond blah, blah, blah already has a small chip. Only reason I'm keeping it and not returning it is to show it to friends and family."
It can go in the oven. I can use metal utinsils with it. I can use medium-high heat under it. It is an excellent skillet. I shall be repalcing my old ceramic skillets with these blue diamond skillets in all the other sizes. I like to have plenty of different sizes; especially ones that clean this easily.
"I'm astounded to see ANY bad reviews about this pan...I'm kinda a fry pan nut. Have the green one, red one, copper one, and the granite one...These are the best!! Heat distributes evenly, works extremely well with low/medium heat. Can honestly clean them with a paper towel....NOTHING STICKS!! There was no pre-treating or seasoning ..I just use a TOUCH of butter or coconut oil [habit], stuff slides right out. They can go in the oven from the start or to finish up what you’re cooking. Very hefty & solid...and still look brand new.. Highly recommend..."
"I bought this pan cause my old nonstick pan wasn’t working well. I don’t have the words to describe how bad this pan is, first of all the handle heats up very fast and it gets very hot, First time I made scrambled eggs in low heat with oil and my god half of the eggs got stuck to the pan so yeah this isn’t a nonstick pan more like non working pan. For now I’m using my old nonstick pan and that one actually works far better. I would appreciate it if I could get my refund for this product"
"Love it, I am a single dude who cooks my own meals and I wanted a bigger pan that what I had. My old pan was a smaller as seen on tv type but the surface was seemingly starting to erode or gunk up and it was also too small. This baby is the perfect size, I can eat but the pan is a good enough size. You can fit 4-5 pieces of bacon in here easy or a whole bunch of ground beef. Pan cleans up super easy, the surface is so amazing that you don’t even really need cooking spray for eggs but I use it anyway for everything just to take care of the pan. Even if something does stick you should be able to get it off pretty easily with some water and scrubbing. Weight of the pan good for me, not heavy but I guess if you’re a small woman it my be idk. The bottom is 100% flat so if you’re using an electric stove it should heat well. I use a gas stove but I’d be confident with electric. Lid fits and works great, helps keep smoke from setting off my apartment smoke alarm 😂"
"I got this for Christmas, it is now May, less than 6 months from getting the pan, and the non stick coating is gone and everything sticks to it. I was excited for the first two months, but this is clearly not a good pan. Very disappointed. I attached a photo, it is impossible to scrape the eggs off the bottom of the pan, currently soaking in warm soapy water hoping it comes off."
"Six months later. What good is a review that says, ""Just got them, look great, can't wait to cook with them."" Nothing. What's changed. Nothing. :) Still the same pans, still non-stick, still no scratches, still think the best pan ever. I don't use the 12"" too much. I use the 10"" more, and the 8"" sees major use. The 12"" and the 8"" look the same except for size. I hand wash always, use wood or non-metal utensils, never use non-stick spray, and NEVER put them in the dishwasher. You can destroy any non-stick pan with the spray and dishwasher. They are stacked together but with towels or pads between them. Buy these, care for them as I do, and you will be happy. I gaur wone tee it.  Cons: Made in China. Jeez I hate buying chinese stuff. I don't support the chinese government in anyway, shape or form. Finding lids is tough luck on Amazon. Perhaps other brand lids will fit. I don't know, though.  I've gone the rounds with non-stick, from cheap to expensive C* brand. All are mostly non-stick in the beginning but quickly deteriorate even without using metal utensils and always handwashing. Blue Diamond is an exception. I found that I could make an omelet in a 10"" pan without butter or oil. Using a very small amount of butter makes it even easier. The egg just slides around and allows me to do a in-air flip over the sink, of course. Cleanup is simply spray off in hot water, a couple of swishes with a soft brush, and paper towel dry. I fully expect Blue Diamond fry pans to not last forever but if I can get a year or so out of a $30 cost for a 10"" and 12"" pan then I'm ahead of the game. I highly recommend Blue Diamond pans. And no, I got nothing for saying this. I paid for them out of my pocket. And I'll buy them again."
I made a terrible mistake steaming three sausages in this pan. I got distracted for 30 minutes. I walked back into the house and it was filled with smoke. Pan was heavily charred a total mess. It cleaned up good as new!!’ Granted I use a lot of Dawn and elbow grease. But even the most stubborn burn spots disappeared. Fantastic pan
I wanted to wait awhile before I left a review! My husband loves to cook! All of our pots and pans are crap! When they came out with the copper ones we bought one and LOVED it for about the first 10 times we used it. Followed directions for cleaning and first thought AMAZING! Then it wasn’t. It was JUNK just like our other ones that are several years old-almost WORST! Then he heard about this brand-we were quite Leary but I had done some research and thought what the heck!! I’m SO HAPPY WE DECIDED TO TRY!! This pan is exactly how it’s described and BETTER!! I bought one of these for my parents for Christmas even!! Superb product!!!
"After researching probably all of the various ceramic pans on the market, I decided diamond dust in the finish would make a harder surface, thus giving the pan a longer life, so it made sense to spend a few more dollars and get the best. I have a smaller green ceramic pan and the rivets are not covered in ceramic. The Blue Diamond pan is totally covered - the rivets too, so I don't have to scrub hard to get egg or whatever off the rivets, after the pan is cleaned. I am very happy with the Blue Diamond pan and would purchase it again, not bothering with other ceramic pans. I really, really like this one, and the flat bottom is the best on my ceramic cook top."
"I'm not a chef. I'm not a cook. Basically, I'm kinda lost in the kitchen with all those recipes, spices, and whatnot. So, I stick with simple things. I have the smaller 10"" version of this skillet and love it but sometimes it was just too small. I have cast iron skillets but they are waaaay too much trouble for me because they require some effort to use and clean and since I am somebody who detests expending effort, I don't use them. So, when I saw this 12"" pan I decided to get it and I'm glad I did. Besides, I needed another Amazon box to dispose of. My 10"" skillet mumbles and gives me strange looks when I reach for the 12"" pan. But, that doesn't bother me anymore. I never use metal utensils so I can't say how well the non-stick coating would hold up if I did. It seems to heat evenly and is very easy to clean up after use. Seriously, it's a great product.....for me. I use it 4-5 times a week. My 10"" pan was used the same for a couple of years and it shows absolutely no signs of wear. Buy this and you won't be sorry. But, as I said, I don't use metal anything in this pan so I can't attest to how long it will last for someone who does."
"The Blue Diamond 12"" pan with lid is really beautiful but surprisingly big, larger than the stove top burner. It cooks well and the fried egg did not stick at all. I really love the pan and wish they would offer the same graceful design with cover in a 10"" pan. The pan and glass lid are surprisingly heavy. I had no problem with heat in the handle,"
"I liked everything about this pan, the size, color, ease of cleaning, and non-stick properties. I will concede that the handle gets hot, but the advertising told us that, so I was prepared to NOT grab the handle with a bare hand. I've cooked stove-top casserole type meals, fried bacon, made omelets. It has a designated shelf to live on, and I'll not put a smaller pot or pan inside it. I followed instructions that came with the pan, to use a small (I emphasize small) amount of Canola, or Vegetable oil, or butter. Since my butter is a canola/butter blend, I opted for the oil. First time, I used way to much. Just a little does it. And don't use cooking spray, or olive oils. (due to their different heat requirements). I recommend this pan. Addendum: use this at least 4x per week, still like new. No dings, dents, scratches or cuts. I won't use metal utensils in spite of what the ad says, and I don't cook any meat that has bones. I've stir-fried, sauteed, simmered, and luckily, one of my Stainless Steel fry pans has a lid that fits this perfectly. I do use ""butter"" or oil applied lightly when doing eggs."
"Most, if not all the negative reviews for this product are caused by using way too much heat and abusing the surface.......I have used mine dozen of times and there have been ABSOLUTELY no scratches or scuffs of any kind and has been stick free.........YOU CANT SEE A SCRATCH IN THE FINSIH WITH A MAGNIFIER!.....USE LOW HEAT!.....let the pot do the cooking. I will bet most users are OVERHEATING the pan.....no need for high heat.....and use Silicone utensels.....not hard plastic or metal. Some of the reviews here are a JOke. One person shows a bent pan!!!! Yea.....it bent cooking an egg??? That pot was dropped and the user tried to return it and got denied so he saw a need to TRASH the pan! And the chipping and scratches! It is SIMPLY inpossible to chip or scratch the pan with silicone or soft plastic utensils.........What a bunch of CRAP! People are so vidictive. I SIMPLY DO NOT BELEIVE 95% OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE.....ALL THESE DAMAGED POTS SHOWN HERE WERE DAMAGED AND SCRATCHED BY THE USERS...............I will review with pictures in a year.......and the obvious......for $29.....and if I get a year out of it.....I got my moneys worth! The ONLY thing I find wrong so far with this pan is the handle DOES GET HOT......a Silicone handle cover should solve that. Also...this pot was not designed for every type of cooking. Its fairly thin base was not meant for meats of any type of cooking where heat distribution is important. Its best use is EGGS, CREPES, MELTING BUTTER, FRENCH TOAST,etc.........food that need to be cooked lightly with our sticking. ONE YEAR LATER: PAN SURFACE ABSOLUTELY UNSCATHED AND NO SCRATCHES OF ANY KIND. STILL VERY NONSTICK. ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE NONSENSE AND NOTHING BUT LIES BY PEOPLE WHO ABUSED OR DAMAGED THE POT BY USING HIGH HEAT, USING A FORK, LAYING METAL UTENSILS ON IT, DROPPING IT OR STACKING OTHER METAL PANS ON IT. THIS PAN WILL NOT CHIP IF IT DOES NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH METAL. MINE IS 14 MONTHS OLD AND HASNT GOT A SINGLE CHIP OR BURN ON IT.....AND IBUSE IT ALMOST EVERY DAY......IT HAND WASHES FAST, THEN I HANG ON A HOOK... ......WHAT A JOKE THESE PEOPLE ARE. THEY THINK EVERYONE IS STUPID. THIS PAN IS A LIMITED USE MADE FOR EGGS OR LIGHT DUTY COOKING. IT IS CHEAP AND DOES WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR. PLEASE......DONT BELIEVE NOT ONE OF THESE RIDICULOUS REVIEWS."
"I worked in the restaurant business for over 20 yrs; cooked over 2,500,000 dinners. Never seen or used pans like these. Work with medium or lower heat and will still sear and brown. They're almost too non-stick. Food slides around so easily, you have to be careful not to accidently push food out of the pan. Used the 8"" and 10"" many times in over a month, even with metal utensils and not a scratch. They still look brand new. Let them cool, a drop of soap and good nylon brush and clean as a whistle. Wish I'd purchased them sooner. R.A."
"The best frypan I've ever had and I've had many in 82 yrs. I've bought expensive and others and this is by far a gem. I'd like to have a complete set but it's a bit late for me. I'm not cooking much but when I do I'll be using this pan. It's a very good product and does what is said about it. I gave a mini demonstration and impressed others in asst. living that with this pan you have versatility, quality and at a price we can all afford."
"I needed a pan with a lid that was affordable and wouldn’t break the bank. Now that I’ve been cooking with this, I’m interested in the rest of the line. What I like best about the pan is that it is truly nonstick, ridiculously easy to clean and it is the perfect weight. Not too heavy, not too light and has a sturdy feel. And it’s a very pretty pan. The lid is a major plus. I’m not easily convinced by informercials or “as seen on tv” products but I’m very impressed by Blue Diamond."
"Are you wanting to get away from teflon-coated products due to the potential chemicals leaking into your food? Are you tired of your expensive ceramic-coated pans getting scratched and then quickly becoming sticky food magnets? Then get these! I would go through ceramic-coated pans about one per four to six months. This Blue Diamond pan, eight months in, is still super resistant to foods sticking to it. It has a couple nicks, but whereas these nicks in a ceramic pan would mean the end is near for the pan, on the Blue Diamond pan it doesn't hardly matter at all. I am a BIG FAN of these pans and have gifted them to others who also have loved them. Terrific product!"
"I am on a special diet that requires no oil of any kind in the beginning phase, which means nothing but a little water can go into the skillet for cooking. I sauté onions, peppers, eggs, or turkey burgers/ hamburgers, etc. in a bit of water in the skillet and it works like a charm. That's all I've tried so far, no fish yet. It's easier to clean than any other skillet, but it does take a bit of scrubbing with a special nylon scrubber I have. That's for the beef/turkey - eggs are much easier to clean off the skillet. I only got the smaller size skillet since I'm just one person and don't cook anything ahead of time - this works for me. I highly recommend this if you've been looking for something that is easier to clean and cooks evenly. However, one codicil, if you cook with gas, be sure the skillet handle is not near the flame. I made the mistake of trying to pick up the skillet when I took it to my daughter's home so I could stay on my diet with my handy skillet. Burned the heck out of my fingers and dropped the skillet! Only downside to this skillet is that it should have a wooden handle or something that won't burn you. Thankfully, I have an electric stove, so I never ran into that problem at home."
As long as you don't have a hubby who takes a fork to break up slightly frozen hamburger in it. I'd say it's scratch resistant. Still only managed to scratch off a few areas yet it still works well. I give it 5 stars for holding up to my husband and still being non stick.
"I didn't realize it at first, but this pan is pretty huge compared to all the other pans I've ever used. (I ordered the largest one) After using it for the first time, this easily became my new favorite kitchen utensil! It heats up fast on electric stoves that have the spirally heating elements on it and it's heats uniformly! I discovered that the extra space on the pan makes cooking much faster. I have not tested its scratch proofness and don't plan to. I am always gentle with my kitchenware and always use high heat silicone utensils on it (if you don't have one, there's also some awesome ones here on Amazon too!) I have found the pan easy to clean; I always use a little oil of some sort and I clean it by hand when I'm done and do not use the dishwasher. Anything on it slides right off like butter! I also love the deep sparkle the surface has as much as I wished it had a different color at first. Now, I can feel happy about sharing my food with my parrot since this pan has no toxins in it. I got myself a silicone handle to go with it, but the handles don't get too hot really; I'd suggest that to be up to your preference. Overall, this will change how you cook if you go big like me. Meals tend to go much quicker and pain free probably due to the amazing heat distribution. Try it out!"
"I had an OLD teflon skillet that needed replacing. I saw this one and it looked really good, good price, and I was tired of my eggs sticking to the old one. I ordered it after it tore up another couple of eggs, and scratches were showing through, even though I had never used anything but silicone utensils with it. I received this new skillet and have used it MANY times, even with metal utensils, there are NO scratches, NO sticking to the pan, and it cleans up with NO problem. If I were a ""serious"" cook, I would buy this whole set. I absolutely LOVE being able to cook my eggs and have them evenly cooked, and not all torn up when I tried to cook anything except scrambled...It is just as 'non-stick when I have added cheese in with the eggs. It is awesome!"
"I think this pan is a knock off not the original company, I bought the same pan at my Florida home a couple months ago and it’s perfect, but the pan that was delivered in Rochester New York not the same thing stick on the handle gets hot very hot does not clean well immediately I’ve had the other one months and it’s perfect so I don’t know what to think I can only believe that the second pan delivered in New York was a secondary knock off from some company. Not original manufacture if somebody knows the answer please let me know they are two totally different pans from the same place just delivered to different locations."
"When I read about Blue Diamond cookware, I was skeptical. So many huzzahs for scratch resistant nonstick skillets--and so many disappointments. I tried this based on a number of reviews (Amazon and elsewhere). Well, believe it or not, this is the real deal. There are some nicks in the covering (my wife and I are sometimes sinners, using metal devices in cooking). Still, these (I have three different size skillets) represent the best of this genre of cookware (and I have been pleased with others, by the way).  My heartiest recommendation."
"Took the 12 inch pan out of box. Some reviewers said the handle gets hot. So I did a test. First cooked an egg on mediom high. At the completion of task handle was cold to the touch. Then removed egg and put water in pan and boiled. Let water continue boiling on high for 10 minutes. Note instruction specify to use only low and medium heat. Handle was still cold to the touch after cooking an egg on medium high, and boiling water on high for 10 minutes. I cooked with the Whirlpool glass flat top burner. I am not certain why others are getting a hot handle.  After I use this for a few months I will return for a follow-up review."
"Cleaned with hot water, Dawn and a sponge when I got it. There was a little dark forming residue on the surface when I got it, but it washed off. I have used it several times to sear meat, scramble eggs, and saute some cut up yard long beans in balsamic syrup. Nothing sticks so far. Cleans up by rinsing with hot soapy water.  I really like the balance of pan to handle. The pan sits flat on my electric stove elements. I had another brand with solid metal handles so heavy that the pan wouldn't sit flat on the element until I put some weight (food) in it. I can only suppose it was made for the ""X"" top on gas burners... If you have the spiral electric elements, this pan will work well on them.  If you use a small element, center the pan well and wait a little for the sides of the pan to heat up to the same temperature as the bottom of the pan. It seems the sides take a while to warm up on a small element. The large element heats up the whole pan very evenly.  Overall, it seems to be a sturdy, definitely non-stick pan, that works well electric elements."
"I have tried all kinds of non stick pans since Teflon was introduced...all touting best non stick..yeah ... but in the end ALL peel, flake. scratch and look awful. Until.... Blue Diamond!! Everything I have hoped for in a non stick pan! I do use a touch of butter or grease just to keep it looking pretty. Also, try to cook on the lowest heat setting you can use. Please Makers of Blue Diamond...send me the entire set! I promise to do a complete, thorough and honest review! I am looking into a Blue Diamond WOK type pan next....Purchase with confidence."
The marketing claim that this coating/surface is super durable is false. See the attached pictures. It is no better or worse than any other similar pans.
"I tested these pans out. They are super non-stick. They are nothing like Gotham Steel,Copper Chef or Red Copper pans that say you have to season everytime you wash in dish washer. It didn't even leave a scratch with mixer..  It took 3 times to get one that wasn't damaged. It looks like there was a manufacturing issue. 2 pans with similar issue in same place on rim of pan in varying degree. Each had a portion of the nonstick scraped off. This issue was only on 12"" pan. 10"" and grill pans had no issue. These pans are by far the best of the nonstick pans. I have had t-fal snd those are disposable. My Calphalon pans, which I have bought many and are expensive, Copper Chef and Gotham Steel does not come close to the quality of these nonstick pans. They do everything that you see on the TV commercial. There is no seasoning needed like other pans on TV. My only wish now is they made saucepans. Don't be fooled by other similar ""diamond"" infused pans, they are not the same."
This is an amazing pan. I bought this for my daughter - I already own one and use it all of the time. I love that it is nonstick and also love that it is a heavy pan. I use for everything from frying eggs to creating one pot skillet dinners. It is a great size too.
"We bought this product because we were tired of non-stick pans that lose their finish in time. Blue Diamond has stood up to the test. I have allergies and sometimes do not smell everyday odors or scents most people do. I had made breakfast for me. I saw smoke in the house, and went to check. I had left the burner on with the vinyl spatula in the pan. The spatula had melted, and gone down the side of the pan. When the pan cooled I rinsed it with water, and let it soak with baking soda. I was able to clean up the pan with no damage. The bottom was a little black, but the inside finish was amazingly clean and perfect. I lost a melted spatula but not the pan. This is a great product that stood up to my unfortunate test. Thanks!"
"These two frying pans are THE BEST! The sky is the limit when it comes to the purchase of frying pans for me, in terms of cost. Heat distribution on these frying pans is excellent, and clean up super easy. Surface is indestructible, regardless of the tools used. My daughter only uses Pam for cooking, which has destroyed most of my frying pans, but is not a problem for these. They are the perfect size. My only negative comment is that the handle gets a little hot, but i have learned to use the handle close to the end, rather than the middle of the handle. These get 5+ stars, even after many months of heavy daily use."
"There's just me and my wife in our household. We already had an 11"" pan of this make, but wanted something just as good and smaller for doing breakfast. And this pan has hit just the spot. The aluminum frame spreads the heat, and the hard non-stick surface works just as good as those older model, but risky teflon pans, actually maybe even better. We always wipe-out the pan with a paper towel to remove any remaining cooking oil, and toss that into the garage can. That keeps those leftover oils from clogging-up our drain pipes, and in most cases, that's all that's needed to clean-up the pan itself."
"I'd rather call this cookware ""stick resistant"" than ""nonstick."" It is not quite on the level of PTFE-coated cookware, but it is much, much more durable, and is still very good at keeping things from sticking. It's good enough for all my nonstick needs to be sure. Scratches are the bane of PTFE cookware, and the hardness of the surface on these pans largely eliminates that concern."
"I have one other small ceramic pan that I use for eggs and grilled sandwiches. I love it. So when I needed to replace our very large frying pan, I wanted to go ceramic again. I was surprised at all the negative comments I found for all the brands. I finally decided to give the Blue Diamond brand a try. I have owned it for several months now and we use it frequently. Based on the reviews/comments I read, I asked my family to avoid using it on the highest heat, to not use cooking spray oil on it, and to always spread a wee bit of oil on the pan before using. We have been extremely pleased with the performance of this pan. We have made eggs, pork chops, saucy noodles, sausage and onions, and more. It has even heat distribution, is truly no-stick, and cleans up beautifully. The finish looks like new. This was a good purchase for my family."
"Over time, I have purchased a number of different brand nonstick skillets. These are the best. They clean easily (if you don't misuse them) and you can even use the dishwasher to clean them if you choose (I prefer to clean by hand). They appear to be scratch resistant in a way that many nonstick skillets are not. I had an older one that got scorched somehow and I had to toss it (I could never get the nonstick aspect back). But that appears to have been a one off, the result of an error by one of the ""cooks"" here in using it. So, I love these and I have slowly been tossing older nonstick skillets in favor of these."
"I love the color firstly and second, they have some heft to them so they are not flimsy pots and pans. I had a perfectl good set that was about 25 yrs old but I sent that to the RV and bought these for the house. I love them. They cook evenly and so easy to clean. Just make sure not to use metal in them. Only issue I have with them is there is no steam release holes in the lids so when things start boiling the lids start lifting off. Also, handles on lids and pots/pans do get warm - so no heat dispersement there. I bought all the pieces."
"So I don't normally write reviews but I felt I needed to this time. I love the Blue Diamond cookware line. They heat up evenly and do not stick and so easy to clean. I even decided to throw out all my other pots and pans to replace with this line. A tip for any line of cookware even when it says dishwasher safe still wash by hand. The nonstick coating eventually comes off in the dishwasher but the nice thing is the pans are very easy to hand wash. the main reason I am writing this review is I did something very stupid forgot to turn off the stove and left pan on it. it was on the stove so long that it was stuck to the burner. You would think the pan would be worthless after that but it wasn't a little gentle washing and it still works like brand new. of course the bottom is burnt but the actual pan looks brand new and still heats evenly. This was beyond impressive to me, any of my other pans would not have survived my stupidity. So despite other peoples opinions I give this cookware line 5 stars :-)"
"I've used this pan a hand full of times, and it has worked amazing! The pictures I've included are proof you can cook an egg on it, with zero mess! There was no cleaning involved in the post picture, I simply slid the egg off, onto my sandwich!! Just be smart with it, and I believe this pan will live past it earning it's money back. I don't clean it, I just whip it down after each use with a soft cloth. Stop using abrasive clears and sponges people!! and I only use silicone utensils on it. I also put paper tower between my stacked pans (as I don't have room to hang them)."
"I began with the smallest Blue Diamond skillet several year ago. It would not die. I even left it on the burner empty and although it was smoking hot, it was undamaged. I don't suggest doing this, and I don't know what would happen with one of the larger pans, but it proved the value of these pans to me. I don't stack them, and I never use metal utensils. They clean effortlessly. I always use a bit of olive oil or butter when cooking, just because I like the flavor. Many of my friends have them and they have had the same experience."
"The pan seems to have a very durable cooking surface. Heat distribution is excellent. I have used the 8"" for several months now. I never use metal utensils in order to keep the surface in good condition and it has paid off so far. The pan still looks like new. The heat distribution is outstanding and amazingly the food, typically breakfast items, do not burn or scorch easily. The pans also clean up quickly. This is the best frying pan I have ever used. I purchased the next to sizes larger to replace Teflon-like coated pans whose surface was flaking off. All in all I am very pleased and recommend Blue Diamond pans."
"If you’re looking to get away from the Teflon and want a TRUE NON STICK PAN you can’t go wrong with this product, we’ve been using this product for about 3 months now and like them so much we have replaced all our non stick pans with this product, don’t hesitate, take the leap, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed! A. O. From the Arctic 😎"
"I'll have to admit that I was skeptical. I've used ""non-stick"" pans since they first came onto the scene. Some have been terrible, some have been okay, but this pan is AWESOME! I'll admit that I am care-ful of any non-stick pan, and I was so with this one, also. Having said that, I did use a metal whisk (GENTLY!) when I made scrambled eggs, just to ""check it out"", so to speak. I now believe that I could actually cut something in this pan and not harm the finish! I heartily recommend Blue Diamond cookware and have, in fact, already done so. It is everything it advertises itself to be!!! Five + stars!!"
"We've been using this pan a lot for a couple of months and I am very impressed with it. Admittedly I haven't tried using metal utensils, but it actually works the way you want something ""Non-stick"" to work. We've done a lot of frying in this pan and unlike my other ceramic pans this pan doesn't get damaged where there is only a small amount of oil or liquid that wants to over heat and burn. I live with pan ruiners so this is going to hundreds of dollars by not having to replace everything so often. I'm thrilled!"
"Stumbled across this pan at an Air BNB rental. Pan was already well-used, but it STILL had a good non-stick surface. I purchased this small pan and two larger ones, I was so impressed. I like eggs every morning and much prefer a small non-stick skillet instead of SCRAPING the eggs out of the pan. This pan fits the bill. I boiled water in it first time to make sure the chemical taste/smell was gone, then ""cured"" the cooking surface with oil for an hour . It's been working great."
"We have tried all kinds of non-stick pans from the original Teflon and beyond. These Blue Diamond Ceramic pans are the first to live up to all the hype generated for decades about non-stick pans. They are 'dishwasher safe', but we do not put them in the dishwasher. When we finish cooking, we wipe them out with a paper towel while still hot, then soak them for a short time in soapy water. Then wipe them out with a sponge. Done cleaning. I recommend these to everyone. Do not cook higher than medium heat."
"This pan is freaky slick, I was leery because it’s an as seen on TV thing but it’s truly pretty awesome. I’ve only had it for a couple weeks but I’ve cooked everything from fish to hashbrowns, eggs to sautéed vegetables and sauces. When it’s dry and you feel it with your fingers it’s very slick. You do need to use some kind of oil and things will stick a little but not anything major, once you touch the food or spatula underneath it like an egg, it’s slides around very well. And do not ever dishwasher a nonstick pan, take the three seconds and rinse it off with a little soap and water. And don’t use metal stuff and you should be fine. I’m hoping this thing last for a while. And it also has like a grooved surface so on my flat top stove it doesn’t stick down as much as my old flat pan because of the surface area has some airflow to it I guess."
"Got my pan a week ago, and absolutely love it. I know the outside scratches, but I have an electric stove, so it was anticipated. **Scratch resistant is not scratch proof**, so I use only wood or silicone. I expect this pan to last for quite a while, even using it at least twice daily, including in the oven. It’s wonderfully nonstick, but then, I follow their recommendations of using a little fat up front. I also hand wash and dry as I feel the dishwasher may be a tad too hot and detergents too harsh."
"We needed a good non stick pan just to cook scrambled eggs without all the stuck on parts. Normally I use butter or avocado oil but now I don't need anything. The scrambled and fried eggs just slide right out. The most important thing is to read the instructions and care for it like a new baby. Since it works great on a med heat, we have found a lot of things now to cook in it. It wipes clean with just a paper towel. I haven't had it but a month or so and we will see how it does long term."
"I got my 8"" Blue Diamond skillet in December 2020, and it's been perfect. I use it maybe once a week to scramble or fry eggs, and never had a problem with them sticking. I almost always clean it in the dishwasher, and it still looks brand-new.  I've seen a lot a bad reviews lately, and I'm baffled. Sometimes buying from Amazon is as reliable as out somebody's trunk, so maybe some kind of fakes are getting out; but at least they'll refund you if you don't wait too long."
"Buy it! Ignore the comments of scratches, I'm not sure what pan they got or what they do to it, but I've had mine for over 13 months, use it 5-7 times a week and it looks nearly new, easily the longest lasting non-slip coating I've ever owned, and I've tried them all. On tougher build-up, like when we burn something, I use Scotchbrite to clean it, which I used to be wary of for the extra wear, but it cleans it up and does not wear through the coating, amazing.  Update: Now 3 years old and still has non-stick properties. There’s a couple of nicks on the edge since I use it most days, but still cleans up great after Scotchbrite or steel wool…and after 3 years using these, after what people would say is too aggressive, they have not worn through the coating!"
"I love this pan because it truly is non-stick. It has good even heat. The handle does get warm, but that's not a problem. If you can't pick it up because it's too hot, then the heat under the pan is too hot. The directions say not to cook on high with this pan. They also say not to put this pan in the dishwasher, which is not a problem because a little bit of dishwashing liquid takes the grease off and nothing sticks to the pan, so it cleans in a jiffy! I bought 2 which means I now have this pan in 3 sizes and I'm very happy with them all."
"This pan is fantastic. I read a few of the bad reviews for it and they seemed to be about the coating coming off. I think those folks must be taking ""metal utensil safe"" a little too seriously, or maybe they're scrubbing with steel wool? I don't see how that would be needed since nothing sticks to this pan. It cooks very evenly too. I'm thrilled with this purchase and wish I would have gotten this a while ago. I used our old teflon pan way longer than I should have."
"I read quite a lot of reviews trying to find a good pan for making breakfast with eggs that wouldn't result in egg stuck to the bottom of the pan and crusting on. This pan worked AMAZING the FIRST time, and after using it for weeks now, I do have the problem of whatever I'm cooking sticking to the pan; chicken, eggs, veggies, all stick with or without adding oil or butter to the pan. Since the instructions that came with the pan say it is dishwasher safe, I've been putting it through my dishwasher, which even struggles to get a good clean from this ""non-stick"" pan. I also have noticed within using the first dozen times, there are scratches at the bottom of the pan after using only silicone spatulas, non-stick safe scrubbing sponges and plastic scraper (after the pan was cooled) to remove leftover foods. So I don't agree with the ""10x stronger"" and ""you can use metal utensils in this pan"" because this one at least does not seem to be standing up to those claims. Food WILL stick to the pan, there seems to be no way around it. I will still use it, but am disappointed this pan does not hold up to the claims made by the company."
"I'm about 10 uses into this pan, and so far, so great. Nowadays, it is important to avoid aluminum, so this pan does its best to mitigate the affects of said aluminum, and it is wonderfully non-sticky and easy to clean. Because it is aluminum I do use it as my 2nd pan, with stainless steel being my material of choice, and in the role of 2nd pan, when my inclination to scrub is less, this pan is a perfect fit."
"The best baking pan I’ve ever had! Doesn’t stick, it’s very easy to clean. I love using it and not worrying about if the cake is going to break or how hard will it be to clean without scratching. I highly recommend!"
Needed an upgrade from existing pan and decided to roll the dice on this - did not disappoint! Made a glazed blueberry bundt cake that baked evenly and came out perfect the first time.
All I am going to say is BUY IT!!!! Got it for thanksgiving.
My cakes come out clean and in 1 piece instead of coming apart like so many other Bundt pans. I love these and would recommend it to anyone
"These are well made and easy to clean. A little smaller than some bundt pans, but for a small family that's better. I gave one to my daughter and she also really likes hers"
"I liked the size very much, now I can bake two small cakes at the same time. Good material, cakes bake evenly and come out of the pan easily. Also easy to clean."
Diseño bonito
JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WORKS GREAT.
This product is everything they promised. Perfect size too. Love these baby baking Bundt pans!

Love it
"Easy to clean, cake is right out."

I like it not too big but good bake
Great product.
LOVE THESE !!
Just the right and very good product
Durable and nonstick as advertised
Cooks cake evenly. Non-stick so many ce I didn’t have to flour pam
These pans are trash they both drip oil in the bottom of my oven. I’m using the second new one today. I do not recommend anyone purchase these. I would go ahead and pay more for a good Bundt pan. When this cake is finished I’m tossing both of them in the trash😥
Love these Bundt pans. Work great and cake just come out clean without sticking.
Good quality and strong Bundt pans.
Great pan but lacks groves to create a fancy style.
"Die Kuchenform machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Beim Backen haben sie eine klasse Antihaftbeschichtung, der Kuchen lässt sich sehr leicht von der Form lösen. Auch zu reinigen ist diese Backform sehr unkompliziert."
"In diesem Set enthalten sind zwei identische Gugelhupf-Backformen in überzeugender Qualität, die meiner teuren Markenform in keinster Weise nachstehen. Da ich häufig Kuchen backe war ich über die Möglichkeit diese Formen im Rahmen des Vine Produkttestprogramms ausprobieren zu dürfen sehr erfreut und möchte an dieser Stelle meine ehrliche Bewertung abgeben. Ich hoffe diese kann Ihnen bei einer Entscheidung hilfreich sein. Zuerst muss man herausstellen, dass man tatsächlich zwei Backformen erhält, diese sind vollständig aus antihaftbeschichtetem Metall gefertigt und machen schon beim Auspacken einen wirklich guten Eindruck. Dieser bestätigt sich dann auch in der Anwendung, die Formen sind unkompliziert und einfach im Handling, durch das stabile Material kann man sehr gut mit ihnen arbeiten. Die Antihaftbeschichtung macht was sie soll, die Kuchen lösen sich nach dem Backen problemlos aus der Form. Die Beschichtung hinterlässt, wie die gesamten Formen einen durchweg hochwertigen Eindruck, ich benutze bei beschichteten Backformen grundsätzlich keine Metallwerkzeuge um die Oberflächen zu schonen, auch hier sind nach mehrmaliger Benutzung noch keinerlei Abnutzungen oder Schrammen zu sehen, was für die Beschichtung spricht. Die Reinigung gestaltet sich auch sehr einfach: ich wasche die Formen nach der Benutzung und dem vollständigen Auskühlen lediglich mit etwas sanftem Spülmittel und einem weichen Mikrofasertuch ab. Ich bin mit den Formen sehr glücklich und kann sie uneingeschränkt empfehlen."
"Ich habe am Wochenende in den neuen Gugelhupfformen einen klassischen Gugelhupf aus Hefeteig gebacken und kann Folgendes berichten:  Zuerst habe ich die Formen von Hand durchgespült, um mögliche Produktionsrückstände etc. zu entfernen, aber das macht man ja generell mit neuen Arbeitsutensilien der Küche. Danach waren sie praktisch sofort einsatzbereit.  Qualitativ gibt es an den Formen gar keine Kritik, sie machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck und verhalten sich auch so. Eine Form ist für einen Hefeteig (Alternativ Rührkuchenteig) mit ca. 500 Gramm Mehl ausgelegt, diese Menge ist genau richtig, um den perfekten Kuchen backen zu können. Nach dem Backprozess und einer kleinen Abkühlungszeit konnte ich mein Exemplar problemlos aus der zuvor eingefetteten Form lösen. Es blieben nur wenige Krümel in der Form zurück. Auch der anschließende Reinigungsprozess (wieder Spülen per Hand, um die Beschichtung nicht zu zerstören) verlief problemlos.  Fazit: 2 Gugelhupfformen, die für mich normalgroß, also nicht klein sind, zu einem absolut stimmigen Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Ich habe nichts zu beanstanden und bewerte mit 5 Sternen.  Ich möchte noch das Rezept anhängen. Es lohnt sich wirklich diesen Kuchen zu backen:  - Form einfetten und mit ein paar gemahlenen Mandeln oder Haselnüssen ausstreuen. - 1 Würfel Hefe in 250 ml lauwarmer Milch und 20 Gramm Zucker auflösen und die Masse kurz stehen lassen. - 150 Gramm weiche Butter mit 3 mittelgroßen Eiern und 120 Gramm Zucker schaumig rühren. - 500 Gramm Mehl, 100 Gramm Schokorosinen, sowie die Milch-Hefe-Masse zur Butter-Ei-Masse geben und mit den Knethaken des Rührgeräts zu einem geschmeidigen Teig vermengen. - Masse in die Gugelhupfform gießen und an einem geschützten, warmen Ort ca. 90 Minuten gehen lassen. Währenddessen Backofen auf 180 Grad Ober-/Unterhitze vorheizen. - Gugelhupf ca. 45 Minuten (mittlere Schiene) backen, ggf. die Form nach 30 Minuten mit etwas Alufolie abdecken. - Nach dem Backen etwas abkühlen lassen, stürzen und mit Puderzucker bestreut, servieren!  Guten Appetit!"
"Man erhält zwei Gugelhupf Backformen mit einem Durchmesser von je 25 Zentimetern. Das ist eine vernünftige Größe für einen Marmorkuchen, jedenfalls für unseren Haushalt. Ich habe noch eine kleinere Gugelhupfform, die sich schlussendlich aber als zu lüdsch rausgestellt hat. Diese zwei Formen kauft man zu einem fairen Preis ( derzeit unter 15 € ). Ich kann keinen Unterschied zu Deutschen Markenprodukten feststellen. Die Formen sind antihaftbeschichtet. Von daher wasche ich sie nur von Hand ab. Auch sollte man niemals mit einem spitzen Gegenstand in ihnen schneiden oder herumstochern. Notfalls immer Silikonspatel benutzen. Ich fette, wenn es um Rührteige geht, jede Form ein. Zusätzlich gebe ich nach dem Einfetten noch Semmelbrösel in die Form und drehe bzw. schwenke die Form, damit die Brösel sich überall auf dem Fett gut festsetzen. So backt einem nichts an, und der Rand schmeckt auch gut . Finde ich. Andere Haushaltsmitglieder sagen, das bilde ich mir nur ein. Naja, wie dem auch sein, auf jeden Fall backt nichts an. Und auch bei diesen beiden Formen kamen die Kuchen, nachdem sie ausgekühlt waren, ohne Probleme aus den Formen heraus."
"Die beiden Gugelhupf Backformen von KITESSENSU wurden in einem stabilen Karton verpackt geliefert und sind von unerwartet hoher Qualität. Bei diesem Preis hätte ich das tatsächlich nicht erwartet.  Das Material ist sehr stabil und die Beschichtung absolut sauber und frei von Beschädigungen. Der äußere Durchmesser liegt bei den angegebenen 25 cm. Für die meisten Rezepte ist das eine gute Größe, ansonsten können die Zutaten-Mengen ja angepasst werden.  Ich habe beide Formen ausprobiert. Bei mir passen sie diagonal nebeneinander auf ein Backblech. Das gefällt mir sehr, da ich oft mehrere Kuchen auf einmal benötige.  Die Formen habe ich vor dem Backen eingefettet und ausgestreut. So lassen sich die Kuchen gut lösen und es bleibt nichts hängen. Ich bin mehr als zufrieden und vergebe hier volle fünf Sterne. Wer zwei hochwertige Gugelhupf-Backformen zu einem günstigen Preis sucht, der sollte hier zuschlagen!"
"Versand/Lieferumfang: Das KITESSENSU Gugelhupf Backform Gugelhupfform Set von 2 Ø 25cm kam sicher verpackt und heil bei mir an.  Funktionalität/Optik/Qualität/Anwendung: Jede der im 2er Set gelieferten Gugelhupfform hat einen Durchmesser von 25 cm und eine Höhe von 12 cm. Sie bestehen aus lebensmittelechtem Kohlenstoffstahl. Dadurch sind sie sehr hitzebeständig und können ohne Probleme Temperaturen im Ofen bis zu 230°C aushalten. Außerdem sind sie dadurch spülmaschinengeeignet, was ich generell immer super finde, um meine Küchenprodukte möglichst hygienisch mal reinigen zu können. Allerdings würde ich sie, um die Antihaftbeschichtung nicht zu zerstören, nur mit warmen Wasser und Seife reinigen.  Die Gugelhupfform ist sehr formstabil und robust. Sie ist sauber und ordentlich verarbeitet und macht einen soliden Eindruck. Ich habe keine unsauberen oder gar scharfen Kanten finden können, qualitativ wirkt sie wirklich sehr gut. Durch die glatte Oberfläche und ihre Antihaftbeschichtung lassen sich Kuchen leicht lösen, ohne dass Reste kleben bleiben. Allerdings sollte man sie dafür nach dem Ofen erst etwas abkühlen lassen.  Fazit: Qualitativ hochwertige und sauber verarbeitete Gugelhupfbackformen im 2er Set. Hitzebeständig, formstabil und leicht zu reinigen.  Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, meine Rezension durchzulesen. Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen bei ihrer Entscheidung behilflich sein. 😊"
"Es erstaunt mich wirklich sehr, wie hochwertig und sauber die Formen gearbeitet sind – sie können den bekannten deutschen Marken durchaus das Wasser reichen! Als ich dieses Set bestellte, war der Preis bei sechzehn Euro und das finde ich mehr als super! Zum Zeitpunkt der Rezension liegt er bei zwanzig Euro – hier könnte man vielleicht auf ein Angebot warten, wenn es nicht eilt. Allerdings passt für mich bei der gelieferten Qualität auch dieser Preis.  Die Beschichtung ist super glatt und ebenmäßig. Ob Rührteige oder Hefeteige (für den klassischen Gugelhupf), alles backt gleichmäßig in der Form. Wie bei allen beschichteten Haushaltsgegenständen muss man darauf achten, die Beschichtung nicht zu beschädigen, beispielsweise mit scharfen Gegenständen, Messern, Gabeln oder ähnlichen Dingen. Nach dem Backen den Kuchen etwa zehn Minuten abkühlen lassen, dann die Form stürzen. So wird der Kuchen nicht speckig und kommt gut aus der Form. Bei Rührteigen empfiehlt sich trotz Beschichtung ein Einfetten und das Bemehlen oder Ausstreuen mit Semmelbröseln oder Keksbröseln.  Gespült wird jede Backform aus Metall bei mir von Hand. So hält sie länger und die Beschichtung leidet nicht.  Wer nicht gar so viel backt, kann eine der Formen ja weitergeben – der Freundin, Schwester, Mutter, Tochter oder wem auch immer. Ich finde gerade für Gugelhupf zwei Formen ideal, da ich gerne deftigen Guglhupf backe und dann unterschiedliche Sorten backen kann. Oder eben man macht einen Marmorkuchen und einen „echten“ Guglhupf. So oder so – doppelt gemoppelt hält besser!  Kurz und knapp: Ein tolles Set in sehr hoher Qualität zu einem angenehmen Preis, dafür gebe ich fünf Sterne."
"Das 2er Set Gugelhupf-Backformen der Marke ""KITESSENSU"" wird in einem ansprechend gestalteten Pappkarton geliefert. Die Formen sind zusätzlich in einer Plastikfolie verpackt.  Mit einem Durchmesser von 25 cm und einer Höhe von 12 cm haben die Backformen eine gute Größe für einen Gugelhupf.  Das Produkt besteht aus Emaille mit Silikonbeschichtung.  Das Backergebnis hat mich voll überzeugt. Die Wärmeverteilung ist gut. Der Gugelhupf ist mir gelungen und ließ sich auch leicht aus der Form lösen.  Da sich die Backformen auch noch einfach reinigen lassen und der Preis stimmt, vergebe ich die volle Sternezahl."
"Die Gugelhupf-Formen kamen schnell und einfach verpackt an. Im Lieferumfang enthalten waren zwei Gugelhupf-Formen mit einem Durchmesser von jeweils 25 cm. Die Formen sind sauber und ordentlich verarbeitet und haben keine scharfen Kanten. Zudem sind sie auch sehr gut beschichtet. Wir haben die Formen vor dem ersten Gebrauch in der Spülmaschine gereinigt. Da das so gut geklappt hatte, reinigen wir diese Formen nur noch in der Spülmaschine und konnten diesbezüglich bisher noch keine negativen Veränderungen hinsichtlich der Qualität feststellen. Wir haben die Form vor dem Backen gefettet und konnten hinterher den Kuchen unfallfrei und gut aus der Form lösen. Wir sind insgesamt mit diesem Set zufrieden und können es definitiv empfehlen."
"Das KITESSENSU Gugelhupf Backform Set beinhaltet 2 Gugelhupfformen. Hergestellt wird das Set in China. Auf und in dem Verpackungskarton findet sich leider kein Hinweis auf das verwendete Material für die Formen, nur dass sie aus Carbonstahl sind. Sie sind beschichtet und weisen beide leichte Schleifspuren auf am Kelch in der Mitte. Für den Backvorgang und zum herauslösen des Kuchens aus der Form war dies aber kein Problem. Jede Kuchenform ist geeignet für eine Kuchenteigmenge mit 500 Gramm Mehl. Damit ist die Form gut gefüllt, aber nicht überfüllt und es läuft kein Teig darüber hinaus. Das Herauslösen des Kuchens aus der Form ging gut und ohne Hilfsmittel. Vor dem Zufügen des Teiges hatte ich sie mit Butter ausgerieben und mit Semmelbrösel ausgestreut. Ich reinige sie im Geschirrspüler, das geht bisher sehr gut. Die Reinigung per Hand wird die Beschichtung sicher mehr schonen. Fazit: praktische und einfach zu reinigende Gugelhupfform."
"Dieses 2er Set Gugelhupf Formen ist wirklich sehr hochwertig. Man merkt es bereits am Material, welches sehr stabil und fest ist. Trotzdem ist die Kuchenform schön leicht.  Die Beschichtung ist perfekt und rundherum gleichmäßig. Der Kuchen hat in der Form gleichmäßig gebacken. Das herauslösen mit Backtrennspray aus der Form war einfach und schnell. Die Form sah hinterher aus, als wäre nie ein Kuchen darin gewesen.  Die Gugelhupf Formen sind schön groß, so dass locker 1kg k Kuchenteig hinein passt. Im oberen Text wird empfohlen, die Formen mit der Hand zu waschen. Weiter unten steht, dass die Formen Spülmaschinenfest sind. Ich reinige meine Kuchenformen allesamt ausschließlich im Geschirrspüler.  Hier bekommt man 2 sehr hochwertige Formen für einen guten Preis."
"Man erhält hier zwei Guglhupf-Formen, die den wesentlich teureren Marken-Formen in nichts nachstehen.  Die Verarbeitung ist 1a; es gibt keine unsauber gearbeiteten Kanten oder Kratzer. Ich habe sie vor der ersten Nutzung in heißem Wasser mit etwas Spülmittel ausgespült und dann durften sie sofort in den Einsatz.  Auch wenn die Formen antihaft-beschichtet sind, fette ich sie vor dem Einfüllen des Teiges immer leicht ein. Nach dem Herausnehmen aus dem Backofen löse ich den Rand mit einem Silikonspatel leicht ab. Der fertige Kuchen lässt sich dann nach einer Abkühlzeit gut heraus stürzen und es bleiben keine Teigreste haften.  Ich spüle die Formen immer per Hand ab. Ich bin bis jetzt mehr als zufrieden mit den Formen und kann sie absolut weiter empfehlen."
"Getestet wird hier : Gugelhupf Formen 2er Set Ø 25cm von KITESSENSU  Dieses Set von zwei 25 cm Gugelhupf Formen wird in einer Karton Verpackung geleifert.  Die Sichtkontrolle zeigt keine Beschädigungen oder scharfe Kanten .  Die Verarbeitung der Randbördelung ist top und mit deutschen Produkten vergleichbar.  Wir haben die Form nach dem Spülen, mit Trennspray vor der ersten Verwendung eingefettet.  Danach haben wir einen Marmorkuchen nach Omas Rezept darin gebacken.  Nach dem Backen kurz ruhen lassen , Überstand an Teig am Dom in der Mitte nach dem Backen abschneiden und dann Stürzen Ergebnis : Top Ausformbar.  Fazit : Hier erhält man ein gutes Gugelhupf Formen Set zu einem guten Preis"
"Die Angaben des Verkäufers sind etwas unübersichtlich und irreführend.  Die Formen bestehen aus Stahlblech, das innen, wie außen mit einer hochwertigen Antihaftbeschichtung versehen ist. Die Verarbeitung ist stabil und sauber. Das wichtigste aber ist das Backergebnis.  Hier kann die Gugelhopfform auf ganzer Linie überzeugen. Die Hitze wird offensichtlich gut übertragen und der Gugelhopf lässt sich anschließend leicht aus Form lösen.  Unsere ersten Backversuche sind jedenfalls außerordentlich gut gelungen.  Für zwei Formen ein wirklich gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis."
"Der Guglhupf Backform ist sehr schön und sehr robust ,die Verarbeitung ist exzellent also ich hab nichts negatives hier gefunden, es ist schön beschichtet und man muss schon ein bisschen Öl drauf tun oder Mehl damit es hundertprozentig nicht haftet, aber uns gefällt es sehr gut.  Meine Frau hat damit Kuchen gemacht meine Tochter auch, also wir haben bis jetzt insgesamt 4 mal Kuchen gemacht und jedes Mal ist es hundertprozentig gelungen. Wir freuen uns dass es wirklich sehr gut funktioniert Wir haben hierbei nichts negatives an dem Gugelhopf Kuchenform gefunden.  Von uns natürlich 5 Sterne und 3 mal Daumen hoch weil es sehr gut funktioniert und das Teil sehr gut verarbeitet ist."
"Geliefert werden 2 Gugelhupf-Formen mit jeweils 25cm Durchmesser. Die Gugelhupfformen bestehen aus Stahl und sind mit einer Antihaft-Beschichtung beschichtet. Der erste Gugelhupf ist gebacken und schmeckt sehr gut! Test bestanden!!! :-)  Die Antihaft-Beschichtung funktioniert gut. Er ließ sich leicht aus der Form lösen. Die Gugelhupf-Form lässt sich gut reinigen. Was will man mehr? Absolute Kaufempfehlung!  Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, meine Rezension zu lesen. Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen bei Ihrer Kaufentscheidung damit ein wenig behilflich sein."
Dieses Gugelhupfbackform Set hat uns überzeugt. Die Form sieht gut verarbeitet aus und dank der Antihaftbeschichtung lässt sich der Kuchen einfach aus der Form lösen. Wir haben zum Test einen Mamorkuchen gebacken und die Form mit Margarine eingefettet. Nach dem Backen hat sich der Kuchen problemlos gelöst und nur wenig Krümelreste klebten noch an der Form. Die Form ließ sich super per Hand reinigen ohne jegliche Mühe. Da ich Angst um die Beschichtung hatte habe ich die Form nicht in der Spülmaschine gewaschen. Ich bin zufrieden und empfehle das Set gerne weiter.
"Wir hatten noch keine Gugelhupfform, daher war ich happy diese testen zu können. Die Form ist von Maßen und Material sehr gut, nicht zu groß und nicht zu klein. Der Kuchen lässt sich gut aus der Form stürzen, ich habe sie nur etwas eingefettet und mit Bröseln bestreut. Kurzum, ich bin sehr zufrieden und kann die Form nur weiterempfehlen. Das winzige, was ich nicht verstehe, wieso es sich um win 2er-Set handelt. Welcher Haushalt braucht zwei Gugelhupfformen? Unserer jedenfalls nicht. Da hätte ich es besser gefunden die Form einzeln anzubieten und den Preis etwas abzusenken."
"Man bekommt hier ein hochwertiges und robustes 2er- Set zum Backen von Gugelhupf-Kuchen. Beide Gugelhupf-Formen haben jeweils die Größe von 25 cm im Durchmesser. Sie bestehen aus Emaille und machen auf mich einen langlebigen Eindruck. Die Formen sind mit Antihaftbeschichtung versehen. Sie sind zudem spülmaschinenfest. Die Verarbeitung ist top, ich habe keine Mängel gefunden. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist aufgrund der tollen Qualität angemessen. Ich kann das praktische 2er Set Gugelhupf-Formen auf jeden Fall empfehlen und vergebe hier super gerne 5 Sterne."
"Günstig im 2erPack. Die Gugelhupfformen vor dem ersten Gebrauch mit Spülmittel reinigen.  Wir fetten die Form ein und bröseln Semmelbrösel hinein bevor der Teig eingefüllt wird.  Die Antihaftversiegelung könnte evtl. auch ohne einfetten wirken. So fällt aber der fertige Kuchen regelrecht aus der Form wenn man ihn einige Minuten nach dem Backvorgang abkühlen lässt.  Man sollte nicht darin rum kratzen, da sonst die Beschichtung abgeht.  Zum reinigen ab in die Spülmaschine."
"Vielen Dank, dass ich die Gugelhupf Backformen von Kitessensu testen durfte!  Man bekommt hier für derzeit 19,99 € zwei 25 cm große toll verarbeitete Gugel- hupfformen. Sie sind äußerst stabil, haben ein schönes Eigengewicht und eine Silikonbe- schichtung. Den ersten Spülmaschinentest haben sie anstandslos überstanden, und sie sind absolut geruchsneutral. Ich denke, die Langlebigkeit ist hier durchaus gegeben.  Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung !"
"In einem Pappkarton werden hier zwei gleichgroße Gugelhupf-Backformen angeboten. Die Formen sind sehr solide und gut verarbeitet.  Trotz Beschichtung fette ich grundsätzlich vor dem Teigeinfüllen die Formen ein, so auch hier. Der Teig wird gleichmäßig durchgebacken und lässt sich nach einer kurzen Abkühlzeit gut aus der Form stürzen.  Fazit: Solide Backformen – endlich kann man gleichzeitig zwei Gugelhupfe backen!"
"Tolles Zweier Set zum backen von Gugelhupf. Genau die richtige Größe von 25 cm im Durchmesser. Aus Emaille hergestellt, sind sie quasi langlebig. Bei der ersten Nutzung von neuen Formen habe ich von Oma gelernt, dass man diese erst einmal einschmieren sollte, Damit nichts kleben bleibt.  Ideal ist, für die Spülmaschine sind die Formen kein Problem.  Coole Sache ist natürlich auch da man entweder beide Formen oder auch nur eine verschenken kann."
"Ich habe einen Gugelhupf Form von Kaiser und eine von Dr. Oetker. Beide sind ebenso wie diese hier in China hergestellt.  Ich kann keinen Unterschied zu den beiden ""deutschen"" Produkten erkennen.  Die Verarbeitung dieser beiden Formen ist sehr gut, das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist bestens....  Empfehlung"
"Gleich ein Set mit 2 Backformen. Das ist ja mal eine Idee und toll für alle, die gerne viel backen. Die Backformen sind für mich der absolute Klassiker. Die Form dürfte bekannt sein. Der Teig lässt sich leicht einfüllen. Die Backformen lassen sich einfach im Spülwasser reinigen. Gute Qualität."
"Die beiden Gugelhupfformen kommen gut verpackt zu Hause an. Sie sind ca. 25cm im Durchmesser, schwarz und antihaft beschichtet.  Die Verarbeitung ist einwandfrei und die Antihaftbeschichtung ist ebenfalls sehr gut. Leicht mit Butter eingestrichen und der Kuchen geht nach dem Backen problemlos aus der Form."
"Gute, etwas kleiner als gewohnte Kuchenformen im 2-Set. Stabil und solide, mit guter Beschichtung. Man braucht nur wenig einfetten, damit der Kuchen sich löst. Gute gleichmässige Hitzeverteilung, die dafür sorgt, daß der Kuchen gleichmässig durchbäckt."
Nice product. Easy cleaning
"I disregarded the bad reviews on this cake carrier, but now I WISH I had paid more attention. The BAD reviewers are the ones that are the most accurate. This ""says"" it's an 11.8 inch cake carrier, NOT SO. That might be the Outside of the base, but nobody cares about the Outside diimension. People want to know the INSIDE dimensions. That is where this cake carrier fails.  I ""thought"" a 11.8"" carrier would accomodate a 10 inch cake... Boy, was I wrong! The inside is barely 10 inches diameter, so your 10 cake ""might"" barely fit as it scrapes the inside of the cover. Also you get 10 inches diameter but only about 1-1/4 inches in height. So, if you're fitting a cake 1 inch tall, then you're fine! LOL The only 1 inch tall cakes I've seen are the failures that do not rise while in the oven. This is a great carrier for ""Failure Cakes"".  Now, if you're buying this for an 8 inch cake then, you might be okay. But, even then, it seems flimsy and the latch is not good quality, so I would not trust carrying it by the handle or your cake might possibly end up on the ground.  Overall, you're better off paying more and getting a quality cake carrier that honestly reports the INSIDE diameter so you know what you're getting.  I just got my refund on this cheap cake carrier. If you're still looking, then this is NOT the one."
Not a bad product at all I really like this little dome cake carrier it’s so cute it does the job
It's good
Easy to clean. Dishwasher friendly! Bundt cake came out perfect.
"Surely an 11"" cake carrier can handle 9"" cakes no problem, I thought. And while that might be true for just a single layer cake, it is not for anything taller. I stacked two 9"" cakes and the top was squishing my cake around the edges. Just make the diameter the same as the base! Such an easily avoidable problem."
"I bought this for a pie dish that would fit the inside measurements of the dome because the pie has lots of whipped cream on top, the dome top got so much narrower so quickly that I couldn’t even put the empty pie dish inside."
"My old one was very heavy and awkward to use. This is lightweight, easy to coat with spray and very easy to clean. Very happy with the metal ring which stabilizes it since silicone tends to ripple/jiggle when carrying."
"Says dishwasher safe but after washing in the dishwasher it has absorbed the detergent flavor which now seeps into every loaf of bread I make. I have tried hand washing and rinsing it before use, neither work. So after one time in dishwasher the pan is needing replaced. It is however very non-stick for bread which I like."
I received my bundt cake pan yesterday and it was smaller than I thought but I still loved it. Today I received the cake carrier and it was also small but a perfect fit for the cake pan I received yesterday. I love them!
Made banana bread...the sides and bottom rounded during baking and tipped over. Was quite the mess in my oven.
This is an excellent cake carrier and great for keeping cake fresh especially a bundle cake. It is small enough to fit in refrigerator.
This is a good bang for your buck Bundt cake carrier. Nothin fancy but it works good. I made a Bundt cake and sent it home with my granddaughter in the carrier.
I like the design and ease of carrying. I wish it sealed better to preserve freshness.
This 11-inch red plastic dome cake carrier looks like a toy for kids. This can't even hold a 2 layer 9 inch round cake. I wasted my money.. This item gets O STARS!!!
"Got one 6 months ago and despite hand washing and drying right after washing the metal on the underside rusts pretty quick. The silicone is ok, first 5 or 6 uses its good then it started to break down."
Love this carrier. Have used it frequently and haven’t had it very long! My Bundt cakes fit perfectly
I love the silicone
"The cake cover is an excellent size. It would cover most cakes you'd make. It's easy to clean. However, if you're making a solid cake, I wouldn't carry it without supporting the bottom."
It’s to small for a small layer cake
I got this for when I make a layer cake. We're only talking 2 layers mind you. This is more for a bundt cake maybe.
I would not carry it with a cake in it by the handle plastic is very thin and flimsy
It’s too narrow a diameter for a regular Bundt cake…
"This is not an 11” cake holder, or even a 10” cake holder maybe an 8” cake holder if it is a 2 layer cake. Or a 9” for a pie or single layer cake. Very disappointed. I waited 2 months for this to get here and won’t work for the purpose we bought it for."
"I thought it would hold a 10 inch cake with icing it did not, only held the cake barely without glaze or icing."
"I was an easy convert to switching to silicone kitchen accessories of all kinds of various types. After years of putting up with baked on foods, discolored utensils, things that crack and break and more it is so nice to cook with kitchen stuff that usually only needs a quick wipe with a soapy sponge. And beyond that there are a couple of added benefits. Two of them are having a kitchen full of bright cheerful colors and the storage considerations of some items being collapsible and taking up a fraction of the under cabinet space.  My first test of this cake pan was to make a batch of what I guess are called health bars, which are usually cut into squares but that didn’t concern me as much as knowing that unless these things are cooked just right they can burn or come out mushy and they almost always stick to most pans.  Baking them in this pan was totally simple, I just mixed everything right in the pan and then flattened it and stuck it into the oven. At the designated time I pulled them out and flipped the pan over and my photo shows what I got – they were perfect. And cleanup? The photo of the pan was after I flipped it over and didn’t touch it with anything, it was almost clean enough to just put away as is. But as I said previously all I had to do is swish it with a soapy sponge.  I’m learning that not all silicone pans are the same. So it was surprising that one from Amazon Basics was thicker and more substantial than one from a well-known name brand. And unlike most of the others this one has a very solid metal ring and handles so when you pull your cake, or shepards pie or lemon meringue pie out of the oven it won’t sag and spill all over. Be sure to wear oven mitts though, the metal as well as the silicone gets hot.  I am completely sold on this baking pan. Without looking I would have set a fair price for it in my mind at twelve bucks so it’s right in the range of where it should be. That earns it five stars."
"An 8.5"" square pan is exactly the size and shape that I needed to bake my brownies. I was lucky to have found this red, silicone, square pan from Amazon Basics in the 8.5"" size.  This is actually the 2nd silicone pan from Amazon Basics that I have used. I was so impressed by how well the loaf pan did when I baked my loaf of zucchini bread that I surely had to have this one for my brownies.  I like that the silicone material is much, much more lightweight than an all metal or glass baking pan. It's actually quite remarkable hust how much lighter! Not only is this pan lighter but my brownies do not stick in this pan, unlike my old kind. The rippled bottom of the pan, inside and out, seems to help distribute heat more evenly as well as keeping foods from sticking.  When it comes to storing this pan, it's amazing because it doesn't take up that much space. The silicone can be smushed and keep it shape! The red silicone is flexible and strong, not hard like other pans I have used. I like that it has been designed with metal handles, that are wider, easier to pick up and to carry. An important feature especially when I have a hot pan to take out of the oven. This same metal has been designed all the way around the top of the pan making it stronger than an all silicone pan. It's really easy to clean with warm water and dish soap. I think it can even be washed in the dishwasher on the to rack. Ive had to do no scrubbing to remove any foods or oils left either.  Overall, I am impressed with my square, 8.5"" red, silicone baking pan and can't wait to find other sizes from Amazon Basics that I need."
"This bright Red, Silicone, Loaf Pan from Amazon Basics measures 8.5"" x 4"", the perfect size and shape for baking loafs of my homemade breads and meatloaf.  Loving to bake, I have always liked to use great quality pans that hopefully do not stick and are easy to care for! Thankfully, this silicone loaf pan worked perfectly and it did not stick!  It's super easy to clean, lightweight, stylishly colored and has a very durable design. The wider side handles is a great safety design, in my opinion. There's more surface space to pick up and carry a fresh out of the oven HOT loaf of bread or any dish really.  The insides ribbed silicone bottom helps with foods not sticking. Plus, I also feel that this design helps distribute the heat, on the bottom from my oven more evenly for an even bake. I love that the entire outter rim of the pan is made from a very durable non-stick metal. I've used other silicone bake dishes that did not have this design and it was an absolute disappointment and disaster. I have NO issues or problems to mention about this loaf pans design, look, feel, functionality, etc.  This is now my all time favorite loaf PAN to bake in! I have donated all of my other loaf pans and now ONLY use this exact style because in my opinion, it's the best made and works the best over all of those.  Storing my new silicone loaf pan is so much easier as it takes up way less space vs. all of my non-silicone pans! It's collapsible design is a big space saver.  At a low price point of only $10.11{before tax}, as of my,review, this bright red, silicone, loaf pan from Amazon Basics is an affordable option that I feel every kitchen should have!"
"Amazon Basics is Amazon’s store brand for certain things, and my experience with these products has been mostly good, particularly their kitchen tools and cookware. We needed a cake carrier/saver for 9” cakes, and I selected this one to meet that need. While it isn’t the largest or most sturdy cake saver I’ve seen and used, it is just fine for my purposes, seems to be made reasonably well, and it is priced nicely.  This particular cake carrier accommodates a 9” 2-layer cake or a bundt cake. In the case of the layer cake it is a tight fit but it does work, as long as you center the cake carefully before putting the dome on top. The lid locks to the base via two clips on either side, and these hold well enough to allow for carrying the whole assembly (cake and all) by the handle. So far I haven’t had any trouble with weight; I would exercise some caution if carrying something particularly heavy.  This is suitable for both serving and transport.  Price-wise, this has a reasonable price tag. It is not overly expensive and will not break the bank, and it is not so cheaply made as to be a waste of your money. In my opinion, the asking price is quite reasonable.  This isn’t the largest or fanciest cake saver out there but it does work well for average-sized cakes. It’s priced right and made reasonably well."
"This is by far the best pan I’ve ever made brownies in. I used a mix and made chewy brownies with slightly crisp edges and bottom. They were extremely easy to get out of the pan in one piece after cutting them in small squares. Usually, the first one out of the pan is all messed up but this pan made it so easy. I used a sharp, serrated steak knife to cut the brownies and it did not scratch or leave marks on the pan. This pan is superior to other silicone pans I have because of the nonstick metal frame and wide handles, making it easier and safer to pick up and carry the pan. The nonstick metal is very easy to clean if your batter splatters on the handles.  The mix I used had cooking times for both metal and glass pans, so I split the difference for the silicone pan and my chewy brownies were perfect. Cleanup is also extremely easy with this pan using a sponge and soapy water or the dishwasher. Soaking is not required because baked-on batter comes off easily with no scrubbing. The only possible downside to this pan is that when it was full of batter, it sags a bit in the middle when you pick it up to put it in the oven. This might have an effect on some types of cakes, but it didn’t effect my brownies. They came out of the oven evenly baked and flat on the top. I would recommend this pan to anyone."
"I usually use all metal baking pans, but decided to give this Amazon basics silicone square brownie pan a shot to see how well it worked. And I’m happy to say that I will be using this for and brownie baking I do from now on!  This pan has a grey outer handle and rim that is harder silicone and makes sure the pan keeps its shape. It also doesn’t get super hot in the oven on that area which is a plus. The red part is a really soft silicone that is very pliable. It also has a wave like pattern on the bottom of it.  My brownies turned out awesome in this though! There was no crispy parts to them at all, they were soft and chewy all around, even the edges. You can’t get that in a metal pan. Not only did the brownies taste amazing, but this is super easy to clean. I did take the brownies out of the pan to early when they were still warm, and a tiny bit did stick to this. But there was no scrubbing required to get that bit off. It rinsed away with water! To me, making the clean up easier for me is just the icing on the cake! Definitely recommend this!"
"I have seen the silicone bake pans advertised for a while now, and had toyed with the idea of trying one. I was concerned they would not be ‘durable’…meaning ai would end up with batter all over the inside of my oven…and that it would leave a funny taste on my food. I came across this Amazon Basics loaf pan and decided to give it a try.  I must say, that I was pleasantly surprised. When I I opened the package, it seemed quite well made and like I wouldn’t have to worry about it losing it’s shape in the oven. It had a nice non-stick metal frame around the top which really helps keep it in shape. I was excited to give it a try.  My first ‘baking masterpiece’ in my new loaf pan was a banana bread. It came out excellent. It was cooked through and well-browned with not a burnt spit on it. But most importantly, it came out of the pan with no problem at all. And it tasted great…none of that ‘silicone aftertaste’ that Ai was concerned about. Definitely a nice pan..I’l sold on the silicone.  5 stars"
"This is a very good cake carrier for small cakes. I appreciate that the handles that clip the top onto the bottom are molded into the top, so there's nothing to snap off or get misplaced. It's pretty sturdy overall and can be used to safely transport a cake, or to safely store it on your counter until it's time to eat it. It's also possible to fit this inside my refrigerator, and I like that it's not really huge so I can keep my cake fresh and cool in the fridge without taking up all the available space. It's also nice that the top is transparent so that you can see the cake inside. A decorated cake can be a work of art so it's nice to be able to display it safely. :-) I have a much larger cake carrier as well but I like this smaller one as much more practical for 9-in cakes."
"I've done a lot of baking since the start of the pandemic. Breads, loaves, cheesecakes...you name it...I've probably at least tried it. I typically use glass loaf pans, as that is what I have in the house, but decided to get one of these. I have silicone donut pans and love them. This was absolutely worth it. I made a babka last night and it came out great! I sprayed the pan lightly...although I likely wouldn't need to do that...and it popped right out without being fully cooled. The inside of the pan was completely clean compared to my glass pans...which I line with parchment and still need some scrubbing. Definitely worth it for the baker! Can't wait to try some of my other recipes."
"I got this pan to make a strawberry shortcake, which requires several 9"" layers of cake. I was pretty impressed with this pan. It's not as thick as other silicone baking items I have, but it gets the job done. I like the metal handles and the metal ring around the top of the pan to give it stability.  The pan was very easy to clean and the cake was SO easy to get out versus a metal cake pan. I waited til it cooled a little, then flipped the pan over and gently pushed the bottom and the cake came out in one piece. Very happy with this pan! Just be sure not to cut a cake while it's in the pan or you'll cut the silicone."
"This is SO MUCH better than silicon pans that don’t have a metal top edge. I can move this around, even when it is full of batter, without it collapsing and spilling. I also love how this makes my quick breads come out fully cooked but without browning around the edges. And, of course, it’s super easy to get the loaf out. If I flip the load upside down, it even has a nice ripple pattern on it. I am switching all my loaf pans to this; it’s that good.  But that’s JustMe. (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)"
"This silica pan has some flex to it but I had minimal bowing on the sides of my pumpkin bread (pictured). Due to the thick brick-like quality of bread, the flexing did not damage it when removing from the oven.  I have a similar pan with the ridges and it has sticking issues so I sprayed this with non-stick spray (and will continue to do so) just in case. If these had instructions, I think it would recommend using spray. The bread popped right out.  This did not come with any instructions or labels on the pan itself (as I would prefer) so if you need to remember the pan size or if it is dishwasher safe, you will need to come back to this page.  Some breads I make cook at 500 F and I doubt this bread pan is rated for that. The issue is that I have no idea what temperature this is rated to because it is not mentioned anywhere, including this listing. I hope they update this page to reflect the maximum temperature although I think it should be on the pan itself also."
"I love making up new recipes for Bundt cakes, and this gives me no reason that I can't share!  Seriously, this carrier is just perfect for my Bundt's that are firm on the outside and moist on the inside. You just undo the lid, place your cake inside and snap the lid back on. The lid has a handle but I still tend to put a hand under the bottom of the cake and do not carry it by the lid-I mean, who wants to drop a delicious homemade cake? I'm happy that it keeps it fresh and covered and at such a reasonable price."
This is so much easier than trying to dome foil around an iced cake. There’s plenty of room for Bundt and even multilayered cakes. The plastic is strong and durable and I love the clear dome lid. It latches to the base and there’s a well secured handle for carrying if you need to transport a cake. I have mainly used it to cover cakes at home and they stay fresh and pretty. Cleanup is a breeze. It’s top rack dishwasher safe but I hand wash it. I’m very happy with this cake carrier and highly recommend it.
"I usually use glass domes for my cakes, but have been wanting one of these portable cake carriers for quite a while now. This one from AmazonBasics is simple and handy. Red with a clear top. Made of sturdy plastic. It has a handle for carrying on top. Even if you're not planning to bring the cake out of the house, it's a great way to store it to keep it fresh and moist. And, of course, it's fantastic for taking to a party, friend's house or work. Holds a good sized round cake. To me, a must have for bakers."
"I love silicon products. Cleanup is a breeze. I still recommend placing the pan on a cookie sheet to bake for ease of handling. I also recommend putting a piece of parchment paper as a liner before filling the pan, just for stability of the finished product. It will hold the cake together better. It will turn out nicely after cooling off. The handles on this pan come in handy too for maneuvering in and out of a hot oven. Happy with Amazon basic kitchen products and definitely recommend them."
"LOVE have silicone baking pans - no more clanking around in the cupboard digging our pans, no more worrying about scratches in the Teflon coating, no more hard to clean pans, no more cakes ruined by sticking. Just use like a regular pan, but the cake pops out perfectly every time (you can turn the cake pan inside out if needed)! These are SO great! The best. This one is extra nice because it has a stiff rim (better for holding and carrying when filled)."
Time to move into the Space Age and retire at least one of my old battered 8” brownie pans. For my maiden recipe I baked a coffee cake and it turned out great. It baked in the time specified in the recipe. The cake cut easily and the piece came out of the pan very smoothly. I used a spreader rather than a sharp knife to cut and remove the piece of cake from the pan. I like the metal frame to steady the silicone. All in all a great addition to my baking equipment.
"This silicone pan has worked out perfect for us. Functionally it works the same as our other metal pans. However, I've found that it's much easier to release the cake once baked. It also keeps shape much better then I expected. The other thing is that it is very easy to clean. The metal ring is essential for transporting to/from the oven. It also helps keep the shape. I will definitely purchase another!"
"I lost my loaf pans in a recent move, and I was craving banana bread, so I ordered this one. I have mixed feelings about silicone pans...some have been great, and some not so much. This one has nice, solid handles, making it easy to carry, which I really like. It's a nice size, and it was easy to get my bread out, even with chocolate chips in it (I did spray with some Pam for baking before, but I do that with any pan, even the ""nonstick"" ones). It is very thin and a bit floppy, but it's fine once you get the dough in it. My bread was evenly browned, and I liked the fact that it didn't get too dark around the edges as high-sugar breads have a tendency to do when cooked in nonstick pans.  As someone else pointed out, the issue with this pan is that all you get is the pan--no directions for care or use, and no guidance as to safe oven temperatures. I was okay with cooking bread at 350 F in it, but would I do a meatloaf in it? Not unless I knew it could handle the higher temperature and grease associated with that particular dish. I hoped this would replace my older loaf pan, but I'm not comfortable making higher-heat foods in it (or putting it in the dishwasher) unless I know more about it. I usually hand wash my pans, but this seems like it would be hard to clean if anything really stuck to it (like a baked-on tomato topping from a meatloaf), so I wouldn't mind knowing what is safe to use on it to clean it.  It is okay, but if I had it to do over again, I would've just ordered a standard metal pan, since I really don't know much about this one. As is, I will keep this one and use it in addition to a metal one when I am making two loaves of bread at a time (which I usually do, because it's easier to make 2 loaves and just freeze one)."
"I was a little taken back when i unboxed this pan since it has a solid frame and a soft, flexible main pan. I was wondering how well it would hold up while in the heat of the oven. I checked and the silicone base can more than handle the heat needed for baking your typical brownies. We tried the pan and were very satisfied with the treats that resulted. Pleasantly surprised and satisfied."
"I can't explain how happy I am with this silicone pan. It's not just for cakes but it performs perfectly every time I use it. I recently made a quiche and it was the best one I've made to date. Not only did it cook evenly and perfectly but it just came out effortlessly. Silicone bakeware is now my all time favorite. Very versatile, effective and clean way to bake. Highly recommend"
"Baked a batch of brownies. Maaaaan, they were all the perfect consistency and popped right out of the pan. The handles made it easy to balance a pan full of runny batter with no problems. Clean-up was easy. I cooked a quiche in it too. Same even baking and easy to get slices out of pan.  For a budget pan, this yields outstanding results. I would get this again!"
"This is super easy to use and is a great way to keep your baked goods on your counter and keep them both safe and fresh. Plus it makes it super easy to take them to a picnic or party. The lid attaches to the base with a simple twist so you don't have to fumble to attach it. It's a sturdy plastic but isn't really heavy, and has a very handy carrying handle on the top."
A great silicone loaf pan - had zero issues. The frame was sturdy enough that it kept the shape of the loaf and did not collapse. The soft bottom allowed for easy removal of whatever item you're making in the pan. Very nice little silicon pan.
"This pan is great for baking cakes or brownies. The silicone makes it really easy to take the baked good out of without having to use a non stick liner of any kind. The metal/silicone handles are great for added stability and an easy way to take the baked item out of the oven. This is easy to clean, I just put mine in the dishwasher to be washed."
"I admit I have been slow to use and like silicone bakeware. The silicone seems flimsy to me, and you have to support the underneath. This has a metal rim with handles, which gives it the support needed. It is easy to clean. It does not collapse like the measuring cups or funnels, but it still easy to squeeze in my cabinet. Recommend"
"So this cake carrier is attractive but smaller than expected. It's described as 11"", but the part where the cake will sit is only 10"" in diameter. The dome, once you account for the dip where the handle is, and the slightly tapered sides, will accommodate a 5"" tall cake at most. So I would say this could fit a 9"" cake (because once it's frosted it will be more than 9"") and 2 layers at most.  The swirl pattern on the dome is attractive. The handle is comfortable and easy to carry. The side latches snap closed - they are not ""Twist-to-lock"" as described. It's secure enough, just not as described.  Overall it's a nice cake carrier, just watch the size."
"I've used some different silicon bakeware. The edge really make a difference in using the pan and for holding its shape when filled with batter. Be aware It doesn't create a crust on the bottom. For the items I plan to cook in the pan, this doesn't really bother me. I'm fine with brownies or cakes not having a crust. I also have the round pan and made cornbread in that pan. I admit, I missed the crust alot for cornbread & I will be keeping a metal pan for that. For foods that are sturdy enough, you can pop them out of the mold by pushing on the bottom of the pan. I haven't made a traditional brownie yet, but I did make a thin crumb cake from a box. It wasn't thick enough to take the abuse of being pushed out so it broke up a bit. The pans are really good at not sticking to foods. Even for the cake, I don't think I really needed to oil the pan. Consider what you will likely bake in the pan and how important the crust is to you."
This is the second pan I've purchased and LOVE it. I bought the loaf pan first and my breads pop right out without any parchment or extra cooking spray...so I decided to get another. This pan is great for brownies and other baked goods. Everything pops right out and the pan itself is so easy to clean!
"I got this carrier to use with my flan that I make, but the design isn't practical for that. I need a carrier that's more like a plate, with a dip to allow for the caramel not to drip over the edges. This carrier just has a flat edge that locks with the cover- not good for cakes or desserts that are wet such as tres leches. Nonetheless, I still like this carrier and still recommend it to those that make regular cakes. This carrier is tall enough to carry a two-tier cake. It feels sturdy enough that I feel confident in carrying it by the handle. The price is in line with the quality of the case, so I think that it is fair. My advice is to measure the cake mold that you intend to use with this carrier before purchasing it, to make your cakes will fit. Overall, I still recommend this carrier."
"I've used some different silicon bakeware. The edge really make a difference in using the pan and for holding its shape when dough is in it. This is the only silicone loaf pan I've owned because of the experience in flexing of other pans. The disadvantage of silicone is it doesn't create a crust on the bottom. I'm ok with the cake pan not having a crust. Even if I make meatloaf, I'm ok with the product. But this isn't my favorite for making bread because of the bottom not browning. I think this is going to be key to a decision whether to purchase or not. What I like best about this is that I can push the bread out through the bottom of the pan. And I havent had anything stick in the mold. I haven't used this pan enough to test over time but I've had really good results with nothing sticking so far."
"I have a cake carrier that is similar to this but a few inches larger. It's fine for the big cakes, but most of the time it's too big and clumsy. This, in contrast, is a bit smaller, making it perfect for items such as Bundt cakes, 9 or 10 inch cakes, a plate of cookies/cupcakes, etc. It gets more everyday use than my larger one.  The build quality is good. It has a sturdy feel to it, and the base connects securely to the top. It's easy to clean and doesn't take up all that much space when it's being stored. It actually doesn't get stored much since I fine it's great for keeping on the counter to protect items that don't need refrigeration from the ever-stalking kitties looking for a sweet.  No complaints at all. It's a perfect size for everyday use, is built well, and is a good value for the price."
"So it worked out great for us. We put a wee bit of cooking spray on the tray and that photo is the residue left behind when we lifted the brownies out. They came out easily and that chocolate peels off easily. So im happy with that aspect of it. The brownies though. Wow! Among the best we have made yet. They came out light and soft and evenly cooked. The edges were a bit of a strange thing for us. We expect, and like, the crunchy chewy bits around the sides. With the silicon tray we didn't really have those. It was more of a lightly chewy brownie around the sides. Still pretty good but that's just a matter of preference. Very happy. Easy to use, easy to clean especially if you can get someone else to do it. Can easily recommend if it suits the type of brownie you want."
"I had been needing a cake carrier not to carry cakes anywhere but to keep cakes and pies fresher for longer at home. This Amazon Basics Plastic Dome Cake Carrier, 11-Inch, Red was one star shy of being perfect. The only negative I've noticed is the side tabs that latch the dome lid to the base plate are flimsy and let go too easily, IMO. Other than that, it is a great product. I like the color as the red is visible from the back of my deep country storage pantry. The dome is high enough to clear every cake (single and double layer) that I've made so far and the diameter is perfect for fitting a standard Marie Calendar's pie. Overall, I am quite pleased with this carrier/keeper and will just be mindful of the tab latches if I ever need to use it on the go."
I am slowly changing all my baking utensils from metal to silicone. It's durable and easy to clean. It cools quickly and rust or tarnish. The cake round also makes it easier to pop the cake out by flexing it. Silicone is definitely the better material to bake with.
"- Made in China  Maybe I'm behind the times, but this was a great idea I hadn't seen before. All the benefits of silicone but also a sturdy, rigid frame so you didn't have to fuss with trying to keep the pan level.  The lid part doesn't weight too much either, so it doesn't drag down the sides and risk spilling contents.  The silicone feels nicely thick, plenty sturdy.  Most spiffy!

"Amazon Basics Plastic Dome Cake Carrier, 11-Inch, Red This is a very attractive cake cover, protects from insects indoors or out, and perfect for 9"" layer cakes or bundt cakes. The dome is 11"" and should clear most double-layer cakes while helping to preserve freshness. The clear plastic is offset with a solid red base and red handle. I have not yet tested that handle and it looks like the little latches on each side will hold a cake without disengaging, but I've yet to test that as well. Easy to see the cake inside the dome, but the description notes that it is ""twist-to-lock red base ensures secure closure..."" and it is not a twist to lock. These are tabs. Push down to lock. Note the photo. Easily washed with soap and water."
Great lightweight brownie pan. Collapses to fit into my pan storage drawer. Requires plenty of nonstick baking spray (the kind that mixes grease and flour together) to make sure the brownies don't stick. Cleans fine in the dishwasher.
"This cake carrier is definitely a good deal for a cheap cake box, but I would prefer the snaps on the sides to be more sturdy. As far as dimensions, this cake box is very roomy at 11"" wide (inside I have a short 7"" cake, see photos). The two parts are very easy to wash by hand, I did not put them in the dishwasher. The base has a slight texture but you may need to use some buttercream or tape to stick your cake to the base securely. The snaps hold both pieces together nicely so it is comfortable to carry. However, the plastic around the snaps is quite thin and I am worried that they will break at some point (will update my review if they do). In the meantime, this is a decent cake carrier for a good price."
"I've used some different silicon bakeware. The edge really make a difference in using the pan and for holding its shape when filled with batter. This has the same disadvantage as other silicone. It doesn't create a crust on the bottom. This doesn't really bother me with cakes, but I like cornbread to have a crust and I admit that I miss that. The main advantage I see with these (I have more than one type of pan to test) is that you can actually pop cakes out of the mold by simply pushing it out through the bottom. And these seem to be stick proof - at least initially. I haven't used this pan enough to test over time but I've had really good results so far."
"This loaf pan is perfect for your baking needs whether it is baking breads, pound cakes or meatloaf. I baked a pound cake in it and liked how easy it is to get it out, I just gave it a push and it came out in one piece, no problem with sticking at all. I greased and floured the pan like I would any other pan. I am looking forward to baking a meatloaf in it next. It did have that silicone smell when it first arrived, even after washing it several time. I searched how to rid of that smell and it recommended soaking it in hot water with vinegar and that did the trick. Another great benefit of silicone it is easy to store, great for those with limited space."
"I have some other silicone kitchen products I like and was hoping I would like this as well. I got the brownie pan and it's the first silicone baking pan I've used. I'm not as impressed with it as I thought I would be. It doesn't seem as sturdy as using glass or metal. Also, this pan isn't that big. It only fits a 9x9 brownie mix and it's not very deep.  I thought this would be better than my glass pans as far as being non stick. This isn't as non-stick as I expected though it doesn't stick as much as my metal pans. In the long run, I will stick with my glass baking pans as i like them better but I'm glad I gave this a try."
"Simple to use, and the brownies and cake I baked in it were baked properly.  Nothing stuck to the ""pan"" and thus cleanup was very easy. It seems a simple run under water would have been sufficient, I chose to drop it in the dishwasher and it cleaned up like new.  My only complaint about this is nowhere does it indicate a safe temperature limit - does that mean that there is absolutely no limit or that someone overlooked this matter?"
"I have wanted one of these for years, but I always needed to spend my money on something more 'important' and was afraid a cheaper one would not really hold the weight of my cakes!!! This nicely priced Amazon Basics brand is well made, strong and sturdy and truly Can carry my heavy homemade double decker cakes with the handle of this carrier without worrying about it falling out!!! Very well made, inexpensive and looks really cute!!! Thank you!!!"
"One of the reviews warned me that this pan is much bigger than you'd expect. If you're looking for a pan larger than your usual pans, you're probably looking for a 12"". This bad boy is HUGE. It came in a big box and takes up a lot of space on my range. I have to store it in my oven because it's too large to hang or store in a cabinet comfortably. Aside from the size though, it works and cleans really nicely."
"I needed a good, quality nonstick pan I could make family meals in day after day. I can’t afford the fancy ones, but the “middle of the road” pans wear out so fast. I was resigned to settling for one that was smaller than I wanted because even the middle of the road in the large size are pricy right now. Who knew Amazon had their own pans? It’s ENORMOUS!! I can finally cook everything in one pan, with room to spare so it gets cooked evenly and doesn’t splash or overflow when I’m flipping or stirring. So far the non-stick coating is working nicely, cleans up easily because of it. It’s sturdy, not cheap, very solid. Heats evenly. And did I mention it’s HUGE?!?! I don’t know why it seems so much bigger than the old one I had that was just one inch smaller, but I’m not complaining. All in all for the price, this is a perfect pan."
Good reasonably priced frying pan - just wanted the right one for pancakes and this works great. Pans with hight side rims don't do that well for pancakes as they turn out too cake like. The rims are lower on this pan and it works great for what I needed it for. Excellent non-stick surface and extremely easy to clean
"This skillet is one of the best pans this home chef has ever had the pleasure of using. Mega surprise for an Amazon Basics item., no? (What company is the actual manufacturer?) We recently moved to a small town that doesn't have natural gas supplied to residences, so we have a (horrors!) electric stove. The 14"" skillet distributes heat evenly from a 7.5"" electric element. Amazing. The skillet is balanced, and the extra handle is quite useful when lifting a full pan off the stove. Nothing has ever stuck fast, even when the nasty, electric stove overheats. The shape of the skillet is excellent for stirring, folding or any other type of agitating, with sides of just the right contour and height. The skillet is easy to clean, though it is BIG, so it may be difficult to clean in a small sink. I make dinner for family and guests in one pan, or the family has lots of tasty leftovers for lunch. This skillet really is a Best Buy,"
"I'm pretty sure they measure across the bottom of the pan....which I did not realize, and I read a lot of the reviews. My fault LOL. This thing is huge. Unless you're making enough food for the entire Army in one pan, you're looking for a 12"" pan (at least I was). It feels very heavy duty and the silicone on the handle will definitely help with getting that thing off the stove."
"I read a lot of reviews saying how large this thing is. It's larger than my largest burner on my range! But this works really well in making enough of a side for four kids and three adults.  Easy to clean, non-stick. I've thrown this in the oven to roast potatoes as well... the silicone has not melted (yet)."
This is a big mo fo! I love it! Can cook more bacon at a time now.. and who doesn’t want more bacon?! Right?
"Got this 14"" skillet used for under 25 bucks and works great. I use it for bacon, eggs,pancakes,burgers and steaks and nothing sticks and it cleans up easy also it didnt warp."
This pan is large and works really well. Absolutely nothing has stuck to it so far. You can just take a paper towel and wipe it clean. The only downside is because of its size it is hard to fit in a dishwasher w/ a lot of other dishes. I do recommend this pan.
When my favorite frying pan bit the dust I was worried I wouldn’t be able to replace it but then I found this one. So far I’ve been very pleased with this for heat distribution and the ease of cleaning it by hand (I haven’t cleaned it in the dishwasher). Love the aqua handles. The value for the size is incredible. I would definitely recommend.
"Not only was this Amazon produced pan the least expensive in the same size group (14”) but it is also a brilliant pan It doesn’t do math but it cooks very evenly, doesn’t stick, is easy to clean and it’s sparkling interior is just so beautiful, think Edward Cullen I have used it happily, almost everyday since it arrived:)"
"My wife and I have used this pan about 40 times in the past two months and it is perfect. I hope it holds up. Other, more expensive pans did not last long."
"My cousin received one for her birthday. Loved it. I just have to have one too. It’s amazing! Doesn’t come with a lid. I purchased a 14"" lid elsewhere and it is awesome."
Grilling Rolls for breakfast sandwiches. Large pasta dishes Like linguine with clams. Wonderful nonstick properties I just rinse it with a little soapy water clean.
I’ve been looking for a large pan that was durable and not extremely heavy. This fits the bill. So far it’s holding up and easy to clean. Stays flat of a glass top stove.
It is huge. You can get everything in one shot. And it cleans up so easily. Just wipe it out- nothing sticks. Love it!
This has become our go to skillet. Non-stick. Easy to clean. And it is huge! Perfect for making one pan dinners.
This is a really nice and quite large pan. It's very useful for some of the cooking I do. Glad I bought it.
Way bigger than expected. Review measurements carefully. Heat distribution is difficult due to how large the pan is vs the size of a normal burner.
"I had a large nonstick fry pan, but unfortunately it started to peel. So I needed a replacement. This one was a little larger than the one I had before. Works great! Doesn’t need any more then a spray of oil."
"Been using for about 4 weeks everyday. Heat distribution could be improved but very happy with this frying pan. As described, it is quite large."
This pan is huge and is great when making large portions! The heat distribution is really good considering the eye of my stove is smaller that the pan.
I needed a large frying pan and that’s exactly what I got. Good quality and easy to clean.
Nonstick inside and out including rivets. Love the large size.
I love this skillet. It cooks evenly and holds a lot. The color on the silicone handle is a awesome blue. I would definitely recommend and buy again!
I like the size of the pan easy to clean and nonstick
Excellent skillet in every way!
The size & ease of cleaning makes this pan a frugally priced dream in my kitchen!
Nice bright color
I love that pan! It is great for so many things. For a large family this is a must. I scramble a dozen eggs at a time.
"We use ours everyday, we love it!"
Excellent product for the price. The heat distribution is outstanding. will be buying more like this.
This is a wonderful pan. I love it's large and cooks evenly. Great cleanup.
This pan is huge and we love it. We can cook dinner for 2 and enough lunch for next day as well. I read all the reviews multiple times before purchasing and I'm really happy with it.
Haven’t used yet but is a great size and not too expensive.
"It could be a little more sturdy…reason for four stars, but I use a lot and it cleans beautifully"
"Excellent product, Heavy duty and the 14 inch size makes it easy for larger amounts!"
This pan is huge. It's worth every penny. It definitely serves the purpose when it comes to cooking for big families. Cooking big meals in this pan also saves time of mama who is always on her toes.
"Huge pan, great for frying up a LOT of bacon at one time. Non-stick surface works great. Surface appears very tough."
"I love this skillet. It is sturdy, large and cooks really well. It is very high quality."
So happy to find a large pan with handle. Evenly cooks and so easy to clean
My husband wanted a bigger pan so I ordered this. Now we use it for everything!
"Price is good, nice product. Highly recommend"
Outstanding product really good quality .
Nice pan kinda heavy but thats what I like
I like that it’s non stick
Great value & I’m glad that it’s easy to clean. Gives even heat distribution.
Good
Nothing sticks to this pan. So that makes it very easy to clean. Very good for casseroles and skillet dishes.
Love it you must get it
Great skillet wish it came with a lid it would be awesome
Great pan for the price and it came very fast .
This thing is HUGE and wonderful! Just what we were looking for.
My mother always want a bigger pot and this one is huge!. not that heavy so she can handle it by herself.
I like everything about it.
It’s well made and cooks evenly. It is truly large and a bit of a storage nightmare but I got what I wanted.
"I like everything about this pan, bought one for each of my kids and a second for my home!"
Love love love this pan ! Finally something big enough to wear I don't have to dirty a bunch of skillets !
"For the money, this is a good value pan at this size (14-inch). The non-stick coating seems like it will last awhile, and the handles are well made and easy to grip. The base in not particularly thick -- something I've found to be the case with more expensive, name-brand pans at this size. As a consequence it warps slightly under high heat (as did my prior, name-brand pan). At this price, if it warps too badly I may just buy another one."
"I made meatballs today. Most of the time I need to brown them in 2 or 3 batches. Not in this skillet!! Plenty of room to cook everything, all at once. Larger surface area means sauces reduce more quickly. And it cleans up like a dream. It's a beast! I had to move stuff around to store it. And I wish I'd bought one with a lid. But I'm telling you, I wish I'd bought this thing years ago."
"This is a huge pan, but it is lightweight. Between weight and the handle on the side, it is easily manageable despite the size.  Downside - after using it twice, there is either damage or some stuff stuck on I can't get off. I've tried cleaning multiple times and am trying to deside whether to keep cleaning it or to ask if I can get a replacement."
"Love this oversized 14” skillet. So far, has not warped & it’s super easy to clean. I cook burgers for the freezer (can do 8-patties at a time x 3 batches each time) and it cleans up easily. Does not wobble on the burner. I don’t expect it to last forever, but it’s definitely made the drudge of big cooking MUCH more pleasant."
Just received in the mail! Needed a big pan to make enough breakfast for 20 people. I had a large pan but needed another so I went with this! Just got some lids in today too which they fit better on this pan than the pan I already have but that’s okay. It will do the job I need it to. Excited to give it a try and see how it does!
"We were looking for a large skillet that wasn't crazy expensive. This skillet is not to heavy, easy to clean and has good heat distribution."
Excellent when there's a large number of guests value for the money you are times that have to go back and cook more more food heat distribution is excellent well as far as cleaning there's no there's no parallel take off dry cloth and wipe it out it's done
"Everything I wanted in a large, 14"" fry pan. Exceptional value for the money."
"Is really non stick , easy to clean , heat distribution is great, fit up to 6 chicken breast ."
This is the biggest frying pan I have ever seen. Really too big for my stove.
This Amazon Basics 14 inch frying pan provides even heating is non stick and very easy to clean. Great value and glad I bought it.
Its bigger than my largest burner so the heat distribution is a little off. But still recommend if you need an extra large pan.
"I wanted a tri-ply stainless steel nonstick pan with vertical sides to compliment my All-Clad d3 nonstick stainless set fry pan skillets. The Amazon Commercial pans fit the bill nicely.  With the exception of the sides' profile the Commercials are look-alikes to the All-Clad pans. Their heating characteristics are similar, as is their balance, but the Commercials are noticeably heavier. Their 500°F oven rating is less than the ACs' 600°F but how many times do you put a pan in an over higher than 500°F?  The Commercial's pan edges look like non-drip but they aren't, and I count that a drawback to a saute profile pan. The mirrored finish accentuates the drip. Not an issue if y'[re careful but a missing detail.  The handles are thinner than the AC handles, requiring an adjustment when handling. But my lady friend is happy with them in her smaller hand so your mileage may vary on this point.  I have a sense that the nonstick won't be as durable as the AC's but at 1/3 the cost of the AC's that's a non-issue.  The other quibble I have is that the pans aren't sized well. I have Farberware glass and Nordic Ware stainless lids that fit all my other 8"" and 10"" pans precisely, but not as well on the Commercials. Those lids fit the Amazon Basics pans precisely so I don't understand this difference. I have universal lids that will work so I'm trying to overlook this (but the universals don't do oven duty as the Nordic Ware does).  Not everyone will agree with my quibbles so in sum, I say the Amazon Commercial pans are a great buy and will do well by an owner who knows how to cook with tri-ply stainless steel. They're a good compliment to All-Clad pans, and save having to resort to anodized aluminum for a non-stick interior or knockabout pans."
"This pan isn't the best or the worst, but my other nonstick cookware is much more effective at its one job: cooking without sticking.  For reference, I'm talking about cooking things like eggs with relatively low heat, using oil or butter in the pan. They still stuck. They glide across the surfaces of my other nonstick pans cooking at the same temp with the same cooking fats. And I *never* cook anything with high heat using nonstick cookware.  I was also concerned because of photos other reviewers posted showing a razor-thin nonstick coating that came off after a short time. I didn't keep mine long enough to see whether that would happen.  To be fair, my other cookware is also more expensive. I've had great results with Misen as well as some of Cuisinart's pans (not the lower priced ones). This measures up to other cheap pans, like those you might find at a supermarket. It has the look and feel of a higher-end piece of cookware, but not the performance.  My advice: spend a little more and get what you paid for."
"I admit I was a bit skeptical ordering the Amazon brand knockoff of the All Clad frying pans. Amazon brand has occasionally disappointed in the past (with clothes especially), and this pan was so much cheaper than the similarly sized All Clad that I figured there must be something wrong with it. Well, if there is we haven't discovered it yet in the two months or so we've used this pan. It's properly heavy, looks well made, and works very well on our induction cook top -- just as well, as far as I can tell, as the much more expensive All Clad we also have. So, so far, what's not to like?"
"This is an outstanding non-stick skillet! Its thick tri-ply construction heats evenly and cleans up easily. I don't usually use pans with non-stick coatings, but I bought this pan for a specific purpose. We enjoy Japanese gyoza (pot stickers) which can be tricky to cook without sticking in an ordinary skillet. This pan solves that problem and works perfectly. It has a broad flat bottom that easily accommodates 18 to 20 gyoza at a time. The non-stick coating ensures the bottoms of the dumplings caramelize nicely -- without ever sticking. I am totally pleased!"
"The minute you pick up this frying pan you know it is quality....it is quite heavy. But, the real reason you are going to love this frying pan, is that it does what it says it is going to do.....cooks anything evenly and nothing sticks! I have cooked practically everything in it (eggs, hamburgers, grilled cheese, etc) and nothing sticks to it....making it so easy to clean. This is an excellent pan and I highly recommend it."
"I admit I've never used it personally but it does seem to be made well. The build quality is good, and it's heavy enough to have good heat retention. I actually got it for my girlfriend to use in order to keep her from trashing my cast iron and carbon steel. She loves it because it works well for her and she doesn't have to worry about seeing the sad look on my face when I see what she's done to my beloved vintage cookware."
"I purchased this pan to replace ones that have been losing their non-stick surface. After much research, I have concluded that non-stick pans, no matter how well cared-for, will only last 5 years or so. I chose this one because I wanted the heavier steel, and the price was excellent compared to others. I will be babying it with nylon utensils and hand-washing. So far, we have been using it almost daily for over a month, and we are very pleased with its performance."
"This is great sturdy pan. I had to give up my anodize calphalon nonstick pans when I got a new induction range and it was difficult to find a good quality non-stick for induction. Most have an extra disk on the bottom to add induction-friendly material to an otherwise thin pan which doesnt heat evenly and has a seam on the outside. These are smooth and uniform and a good sturdy weight and balanced so its not difficult to lift with the handle. They heat evenly and quickly, nothing sticks or pools to the center. Very quick and easy clean."
"This pan is fantastic and for the price, it’s unbeatable. Best non-stick pan I’ve had — let’s hope it holds up over time. I cook eggs on it every day."
"I was pleasantly surprised as the heft of this little 8"" pan! Feels like real quality. Hoping the interior holds up over time, that's the real test, right? So far, so good!"
"Solid build and materials- much nicer than exppected. I needed to replace an older small so I took a plunge- glad I did. Inside bottom diameter is 9.3"""
This is a very good frying pan. The nonstick surface is easy to clean. It has a good weight for durability.
"Best pan I've ever used, perfect size and easy to clean, I will definitely buy another as a gift to my sister-in-law."
I bought one of these To try out and I'm pleasantly pleased it is now my favorite Pan I plan on buying a few more of different sizes
"This little fellow is now our official omelet and egg pan. Superior weight amd feel to the pan. Very professional, will be purchasing more Amazon Basics pots and pans if they are anything like this pan."
"NOTHING sticks. Make 100% sure to oil the nonstick surface with flax oil (flax is a must), and heat it up to a medium heat to let the oil sink in before use."
"Have bought and been using for ~2months 8"" and 10"" sizes. Reasonably priced workhorse non-stick fry pans, went back and bought two more 8"" which are good size for a dish for two older people not wanting to gain more weight. Pluses: * Heavy construction. * No rubber or plastic in handle, so can go in oven up to safe temperature for the nonstick coating. * Good-sized hole in handle for hanging on hooks (hole is too small in many pans). * Works quite well on induction range. Minus: * Non-stick coating seems about as delicate as on most other nonstick pans, so avoid all metal utensils or expect to replace pan in a year or so. * Handle is very heavy-weight stainless - would be good if it were a bit lighter as it is overkill and handle stays hot a long time after using pan in oven. * Handle held to pan by two rivets, to which food sticks. Doesn't seem like it would be rocket science to weld the handle on rather than have these annoying rivets. * Says ""Amazon"" on the handle - do you want to advertise that?"
"A good, substantial, non-stick pan!"
Good looking and super flat bottom for my induction stovetop.
"Bought two months ago, used TWICE for taco filling, big scratches in non stick coating. Im a 73 year old woman who knows how to treat nonstick. My Calphalon was purchased in 2009 and just recently got tossed. This pan is getting tossed today."
works as advertised
This pan preforms just a advertised
Heavy well made and easy to clean. Not a one year and done piece of junk
Great pan really good quality
"We’ll built, durable. Great value"
"I've only used the frypan half a dozen times, but so far, it is a great item. I have never oiled a non-stick pan after I wash it (like the directions tell you to), but if it will keep this pan in top shape, I will continue to do so."
Thought I'd try this. Mistake. Its really heavy but the biggest problem is that is is not well balanced with its handle. When you pick it up by the handle it automatically tips to one side. I'd say it was my grip but I have never had this happen with any other pan I've owned. Almost dumped a full pan of chili on myself.
"If I hadn't already unpacked and used this item, I would return it. 1) As others have mentioned, the handle is too narrow and smooth to control the heavy weight of the pan, especially if your hands are less than dry. The thing is unbalanced and when lifted has the tendency to spin left or right and you can't control it singlehandedly. That is actually dangerous! A real design oversight. I'm looking for a handle cover to prevent that. Maybe I'll tape it like a baseball bat, ha ha! 2) Also, as aforementioned by others, the sticker inside the pan is practically impossible to remove. Requires intensive scraping. Great glue! Wrong place. One could logically expect a label not to stick to a ""non-stick"" surface? And why must you scrape the heck out of your new pan? 3) As mentioned by others, the sides are tall. The pan is described as 10 inch, the bed is about 9 and the lid diameter is 10.5 inches. Suggest Amazon couple this pan with recommended lid and a handle sleeve. As regards durability it's too soon to tell, but in the meantime, the other failings annoy me.  Addendum to previous review: I acquired a 7 inch handle grip which seems to have resolved the handle control issue. Altho it's now a BIG grip, it's better than having food spill because the pan spun left or right in my hand. I therefore assign another honorary star... but it adds about $10 to the cost.  I also added a multi-size lid"
I really like how evenly the heat is distributed with this pan  I also like that I can transfer the Pan to the oven because of the handle  What I dislike is the instructions stating I should not use Pam or other sprays. Instead use oil and treat it much like a cast iron skillet  I am a lifetime weight watcher member and usually cook with spray Pam or olive oil
I read the directions before unpacking. It requires oil to use and can't be sprayed. I returned it before unpacking.
Seems to be a very well made pan. Better than expected. My wife is happy with it and that’s what matters
"The pan itself is very sturdy, borderline heavy in the 12” configuration, but it’s a stainless-steel pan so that’s expected. Because it’s stainless-steel, it heats very evenly and retains heat very well. The non-stick coating seems pretty durable compared to most inexpensive pans and it wipes clean with ease. I’m impressed and will buy in other size configurations."
It was very difficult to remove the two stickers from the cooking surface. The glue was especially horrible. Why is it necessary to have these stickers?
"Pretty nice pan. I was looking for a non-stick pan to go with my Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set, which I like very much. I think this is not quite as heavy as those. The non-stick coating is pretty good. After a few months, it has held up fine.  Works well with my induction cooktop."
"I have had a hard time finding good nonstick frying pans for my induction cooktop. These are terrific. they are nonstick and steel. Others would either not work on my cooktop or cause it to make a lot of noise while cooking. I bought them in the 8"", 10"", and 12"" to replace some I purchased at Costco but are no longer sold."
This compares well with any pan I have had in the past. It is of heavy stainless and the heat is very even. The non-stick surface seems durable though I have not had it long enough to properly tell how it will last. So far we are loving this pan.
I bought tbe 8 inch pan. This pan is great for an omelet or toasting a sandwich. The pan is not a light weight cheap product. It has a smooth flat bottom which works best on glass tops. It cleans up easily. I love this pan. Teaf the instructions for proper care and it should last a long time.
"I bought these in three different sizes, and they are the best pans I’ve ever used. They are heavy and work superbly on glass electric cooktops. Read the directions and prep them with oil, and you too will love them."
"Followed instructions and this fry pan is wonderful so far. This price is right, it's a beautiful looking pan and we are very happy so far. Will soon be back to purchase more from this line of products."
"We were in need of new pans as the ones we had bought aren't really holding up to normal useage. This pan is really nice, has a good weight and is a breeze to clean. It heats up quick and cooks evenly."
"So far so good after about 2 months of almost daily use. Heats evenly, good non-stick properties, cleans easily, handle stays cool. At this point, it seems like it will last a long time."
"I used this in my home kitchen for three months before the coating started peeling around the rim. I never used it on high heat, and I washed it in the dishwasher since the description says dishwasher safe. I liked it when it worked - it was a little on the heavy side for tossing but heated evenly. Other brands can be had for cheaper that will last longer."
"Hey,it's a good pan. Pretty heavyweight, heats up great,gives a great sear,higher sides make tossing ingredients easy.as for durability we'll see. I figure if you get 2 years I'd be happy."
""
"Solidly built. Good weight, no scratches on non-stick coating after a month of use. I really only use it for eggs but man I’ve been telling a lot of people to buy this thing. It was $18 at the time of purchase, really great value"
"love this skillet for my induction cooking, it heats uneven tho most concentrated in middle of pan i have to cook on edges to prevent burning but great value for the money👌🏾"
"Substantial in the hand with a strong handle. Works well with induction, cleans with a wipe and heats evenly, I'm hoping the non stick holds up. Very good value."
"Not expensive, great size, non stick coating works great, and walls come up a little to provide ability to stir and toss easier. Well worth the money!"
"This is the first nonstick pan I've had that doesn't stick. I've paid top dollar for name brand skillets that were advertised as nonstick, but failed. Great skillet."
"these pans are very nice. A bit heavy so expect that but clean easily, cook evenly and is exactly what I wanted (minus the weight). I ordered a second size."
It's my wife's go to pan for omelettes. we've only had it for a little while but it looks as though it will years of service.
"Overall I like the pan, but the handle needs to be bigger. I have somewhat large hands and the pan is hard to pick up and maneuver with the skinny handle."
The coating started to peel/blister off after four months. Excellent performance and a good looking pan - but it didn't last.
"Its a heavy pan. The non-stick coating is solid. The bottom is heavy as well. Overall, it's a great price for this level of quality."
"Works great. It's a frying pan. Heats evenly, nonstick is advertised."
"Not Amazon Basics, Amazon Commercial. Solid Excellent quality. About 3 1/2 lbs for the 12 inch. Flatter than the earth!"
This pan is great! It is commercial grade and can go from stove top to oven. The pan cleans beautifully. I highly recommend for the price!
"Excellent skillet and good for cooking everything. I cook everyday and it has held pretty good, nothing sticks if you use it properly the price was also pretty good."
I have used this pen to make eggs and cook some meat no need to add any oil or spray the pan does it all! Great value
Had others that were too fragile. This is the toughest yet.
Better quality than I expected. It's heavier than it looks and definitely keeps it's nonstick coating. I like it a lot
Non stick pan so far is great. It’s a little heavier than expected but still manageable. Good price.
"Great skillet, works on my inverstion electric cooktop. Non sticking, no problems but only had it a couple of months."
Amazing quality! How have I never discovered Amazon Commercial prior to this? Just ordered the 8” and 10” pans to replace old ones.
"So far, so good. Better than most out of the box."
We frequently have large groups for meals. Great pan on a gas stove...
"Product description of ""Tri-ply construction..."" and the photos led me to believe it was 3 layers all the way through, no mention it was only the bottom. The side is so thin, ~ 1 mm, that it doesn't look like tri-ply, which is typically couple of mm thick. In addition, the handle in the product photos is solid but the one received is hollow. See attached photos. I thought they sent ""AmazonBasic"" by mistake but the bottom clearly shows ""AmazonCommercial"". My trust in Amazon brand took a big hit."
Easy to clean and durable.
I love this non stick stainless steel fry pan. It was just what I needed. Food never sticks and the stainless cleans so easily.
"Fantastic product, highly recommend it. The non-stick coating is excellent and I love that the pan is oven-proof!"
"I love these bread pans. I wanted bread pans that were strong and sturdy, easy to clean, and capable of keeping a uniform heat for my bread loaves. This item meets my expectations. I expect them to be a regular baking tool for years to come,"
My bread pan was too large for a recipe. These are a perfect size and it’s great having three. They are sturdy and truly non-stick. I recommend these.
Great
I have many 9X5 pans and this is NOT one of them. The pan is 4.25 by 8 inches. And it is more than half an inch short on the height as compared to normal bread pans. I'm just sorry that returning it is more costly to me in my time and energy than the value of these pans. Shame on whomever advertised these as 9X5
Only received 2 not 3. No contact information for the store so looks like I'm S.O.L.
"Even though it's described as 9X5, these were smaller than my previous loaf pan, but I made it work and these are fantastic. Bread browned nicely, fell out, probably don't even need to use oil."
"Meatloaf cooked great in this bread pan, just had to cook a bit longer than a normal bread pan. Love how easy it is to lift out and drain, wish I’d got one sooner!"
These pans are the best
"The bread pans are great. Buying a set is the best option if you're looking for high-quality on a budget. Additionally, the heating distribution is excellent. I plan to buy another set."
I love it. It works great
"These are nice pans at a good price. One of my set came dented, but I didn't see it until I opened it up to wash them. I needed them immediately, so I just use the damaged pan. If I had the time, I would've exchanged it."
This pan has made my meatloaf the best I have ever made. All the grease drains into the pan. Wonderful Pan
I really wanted a little bigger ones but they were ok for quick bread
"In a strange coincidence, these HONGBAKE pans arrived on the very same day I had a home invasion from a zucchini that escaped from my garden. My motto is when life gives you a rogue zucchini, make zucchini bread. So into the food processor the intruder went. The squash barely knew what hit him before he ended up in the batter. I set the oven to 350 degrees, rubbed some Crisco into the pans and voila! Fifty minutes later I removed the pans with sure grip handles and put them on the counter to cool. The loaves came out of the pans as easily as the batter went. My bread ended up crispy on the outside; tender and moist on the inside. These pans did a phenomenal job!. They will be so easy to store as they nestle in the cupboard as one. Can't wait to make meatloaf!"
These pans are a bit smaller than my normal one. I was able to split the load i make into two smaller ones. It came out great. Bread came out perfectly. These pans are easy to watch.
I was excited to use this nicely designed meatloaf pan with drain tray by Hongbake!  This pan includes a drip tray perfect for any type of meatloaf enhancing easy of removal without risk of damaging pan finish and allowing fats to drip and collect at bottom of pan. Plus it can also be used as a bread pan!  The non-stick finish is evenly applied to both the pan and drip tray making cleanup a non event and it is dishwasher safe!  A quality made loaf pan!
"This is a good bread pan that cooked my bread evenly. It is a bit smaller than my usual pan, but would be great for making smaller loaves. I think it's dishwasher safe, but I always like to hand wash and dry my pans so they have no chance of rusting."
"These do a good job with even cooking and with keeping my cake from sticking. I washed the pans in the dishwasher and that did not seem to harm them. According to the description, they ""usually"" don't rust, so it is probably best to hand dry them right after you wash them."
It's a sturdy material very easy to use and clean.
"Good quality, good value"
"I had one of these for years. I don’t even know where I bought it from. It started to rust in the corners and the piece that lifts out started to rust too. I tossed it and ordered this one from Amazon. I’m pleased with it. I use 2/12 pounds of ground beef. It holds it well. I first thought, maybe I should place the pan on a baking sheet in case the grease spills over so I did, but, nothing spilled. You may be more comfortable using 2 pounds of ground beef. It drains the grease out, It lifts out easily, it’s nonstick, it’s sturdy and my meatloaf looks pretty tasty and perfectly shaped. It’s easy to clean too. It came with instructions to clean it first, dry, and oil it before using. I rub a little cooking oil on it after I wash and dry it just like I do with my cast iron skillets. I plan on ordering another one because my family loves my meatloaf and I can double my recipe."
Good pan. Would be even better with the lid that is listed in the description.  I think it left the pan and went its own way. If lid has second thoughts and pan takes it back I will update review.
"I got tired of non-stick skillets with very limited lifespans. Wanted a good stainless steel one. I bought this and it works great. I first tried a cuisinart but the bottom was not flat and it cooked unevenly as a result and food would stick to the sides and burn there. This has even heat even up the walls and a very wide flat bottom.  Cleanup is easy: Splash of wine to deglaze, a scrape with spatula to loosen any stubborn bits. Add that to the dish. Then the rest wipes off easily with a scrub pad."
"This is a heavy pan, perfect for searing and frying. I use it for when I need a higher temperature than I would want my non-stick pan to go. The easiest way to clean the pan is to make a pan sauce or gravy to scrape up the charred bits, then a quick wash and dry. Being able to throw it in the oven with no worries is a plus too. This pan will not replace my non-stick pan but can do things my non-stick pan can't and will probably last quite a lot longer. The price, for me, seemed quite reasonable."
"Description says the pan comes with lid and pictures show pan with lid. However, both my original item and it's replacement did NOT come with a lid. After talking to customer support the agent confirmed this item does not come with a lid. Pictures are misleading and description is straight up incorrect."
"It's very well built for the money, sandwiched aluminum makes it distribute heat much evenly from bottom to vertical wall. It's not non stick pan so don't expect it wont stick like them, pro is you can use metal tongue to cook and use metal scraper to clean it without worrying getting damaged. If you preheat the pan and pour cold oil, it wont stick and can perform close to 80% as non stick pan. I have cast iron, non stick and now this one. They all have pros and cons, but for now this SS pan is my favorite so far, and already tossed the non stick pan away. Just with Amazon come out a lid."
"Long time ago I inherited a set of high end stainless skillets and pans. Never used stainless before so everything stuck or burned. That set got donated. Getting rid of that set has been on the back of my mind for a long time so I decided to try this Amazon Commercial skillet. First test was to fry and egg, no stick. Then made some very excellent pork chops, no sticking and added a couple Tbl of balsamic vinagrette to the skillet after cooking to make a heavenly reduction sauce. Blissfully Random on youtube will tell you how to use *any* stainless steel pan. Very happy with this purchase and it is prized along with my cast iron and carbon steel skillets."
"I own All Clad, Calphalon, Cuisinart, Made-in and Misen stainless steel fry pans, and this pan performs as well as them at 1/2 the price. These pans have steeper walls and more cooking surface than the others, which I prefer because it reduces splatter.  If Amazon Commercial made a complete set it would definitely be a best buy."
"Super high quality. Very heavy duty and cleans great. Will last a very very long time. I use it almost daily. One of the best Pan's I've ever owned. 10/10  It may take some a little time getting used to stainless, but once you do, you will love them. Use oil if it's not greasy foods. If it's greasy foods start on a slightly lower heat and increase once grease leaches to pan bottom. Otherwise could burn food or make food stick to pan."
"I have been looking for a good frying pan that will stay flat and does not stick for eggs and breakfast sausage. I'm still looking.  I thought, OK I want a heavy gauge stainless steel (SS) pan. I've been reading that you need to use low to med-low heat with SS. I've tried every setting and I can't make it ""not stick"". When cooking the sausage, it puts a crust on the pan, and then the eggs stick after that. I read that you need to season the pan, like you do cast iron. I tried that. No luck -- actually cast iron works better.  So, I am either a SS dummy or this thing just plain is not made for sausage and eggs.  I love the quality of the construction. It is a pretty pan. It seems to stay flat. Just can't keep it from sticking.  I have non-stick pans that work great for not sticking -- just can't keep them flat. Still looking."
"Works great on my induction stove. Fits the large element perfectly. Heavy, nice finish, and sturdy handle. Heats evenly and stainless steel makes it virtually indestructible for easy cleaning."
"It performs as advertised, browning, cooking and cleaning up well. My only wish is that it have a wider cooking surface. The pan slopes down in size from the rim, making available browning area smaller."
"Wonderful deal, I burnt a little discoloration onto the bottom but who cares?!"
"the size is right. heats equally throughout pan, easy clean up. make sure pan is hot before you put food in."
Used it for the first time today. Seared a pound of XL shrimp perfectly with some great fond on the bottom to make the garlic cream sauce with. NOTHING STUCK and the clean-up was a breeze.
Fry pan came today very disappointed because the description on Amazon says that it comes with a lid and also pictured it with lid but when I opened the box no lid
Comparable to my All Clad!
"I have not used it yet, but it is nice and sturdy."
Use for every day. Easy clean. Great value.
"I was surprised at how heavy the pan is, but it heats very evenly, deglazes beautifully and with proper care it cooks down cleanly. For everyone who complains about ""sticking"" or burning... It's a stainless pan and you must use a fat while cooking and it's not burn as much as fond. You must deglazes your pan. If properly deglazed it creates amazing flavor and comes nearly completely clean. It goes from stove top to oven with no trouble!! I got my pan as a ""second life"" so I got a discount due to it not being in the original box. I love Amazon's like new options. The pan came perfect and cooks beautifully at a nicely reduced price!! I highly recommend this pan to semi experienced cooks or new to stainless that take time to watch a few videos so you understand how to properly deglaze. Yet you can be a really good home chef and happy with this pan. It's large and works well for stove to oven foods. Only true downside is that it is a nice big pan and it makes it heavy. I happen to be a small woman so I can't flip my food LOL. No great loss for the price and more a me issue."
Beautiful heavy pan good heat distribution but everything sticks to it. Hard to clean even using the method described in the pamphlet. Even with a lot of oil and med heat it still sticks too much.
"I've tried every type of new super nonstick frying pan, and they all have benefits, but I've been hesitant to use stainless due to past problems with food sticking and burning. Well this all changed when I bought the cookbook Searing Inspirations. This sent me on a search for a quality stainless frying pan. Well I couldn't afford the multiclad pans I found available on Amazon. Then I watched a video on YouTube featuring a multi cad stainless frying pan by Amazon at a super affordable price. Well I ordered one and I'm glad to say it gets a 5star rating on all fronts. I completely enjoy cooking in this pan. Get one before the price goes up."
"I loved this pan when I received it- heavy botton, excellent heat transfer, oven safe. I have used it now probably no more than 20 times, and last night when I went to use it, I found that it no longer sits flat on the stove top. It warped. Now it's useless."
"Very pleased with the new Amazon Commercial tri-ply commercial cookware. I had previously tried the older Amazon Commercial stainless pans that had an encapsulated bottom and would not recommend them at all. This new line is much better. I think this was very good quality pan at a very reasonable price point. I hope Amazon comes out with a 10"" or 11"" frying pan and some sauce pans with tempered glass lids."
I use this over all my other pans and even my cast iron. Love it! Size is perfect. I ordered a lid separately and it fits. Easy to clean… how? the same method I’ve always used. DEGLAZE it. Then wash it.
Very sturdy. Great value. Perfect alternative if you don’t want to invest an all clad. I like the fact that it has a tall rim. On the heavy side though. Good value for the ratio quality/profe
Everything about this skillet is right. It's sides make it better than my Tramontina 12 inch skillet. It has a lot more cooking surface. It rivals my All-Clad 12 inch skillet that costs 3-4 times it's price. I only wish it came with a lid.
"Nicely made, sturdy, and inexpensive pan. It is great for browning proteins. Handle stays cool and is easy on the hands. My only dislike is the contour of the sides - they are more vertical than I prefer for flipping. Not a deal breaker by any stretch."
Descr. stated lid. Pic. showed lid. NO LID. Deceptive. Too bad. Looked like a good pan. Returned.
This pan cooks very evenly and holds heat very well. This rugged pan will last many years due to its thickness and well thought out design.
Best pan ever! I love this thing. It's a very large pan! It's not non-stick but I use it for everything now. The quality is excellent! Very heavy duty pan. I plan on buying other pieces as well.
more than expected
Whatever you cook in this pan sticks and is almost impossible to clean
large surface area beautiful finish
Excellent value product. Recently purchased but so far so good. Will update later
"The pan seems to be 2.5mm thick tri-ply and is decent overall. This is actually my second pan because the first warped after the 1st use (only at medium heat). This pan is also warped now (a few uses at medium, medium-high heat).  Construction overall seems fine. I like the shape & depth, maximizing the bottom surface and makes tossing easy. Shame about the warping, but is still probably worth it if the warping doesn't matter on your stove."
Better than expected. Super product for the price. Unfortunately made in a police state. All clad was way too expensive.
Good
Looking for a lid for the pan.
This pan has become my Husbands favorite fry pan
This pan is a great value!
Perfect for stir-fry. We use it all the time!
Started pitting after 2nd use durability is not what I exspected
"very good purchase, the frying pan is thick and has a sturdy riveted stainless steel handle"
Great pan. Heats evenly. Easy to clean. Glad we bought it.
"This so called ""Stainless Steel"" was apparently unduly stressed during press forming and/or cladding, which has created a cooking surface that does not function like normal stainless-steel cookware. We've discovered that this product pits very easily, scratches very easily and everything sticks to it. Don't waste your money! You'll simply do as we are, adding an unhealthy amount of oil, just trying to make it work and like us, you'll be terribly frustrated trying to clean it. After impossible crusted residues form with relatively low heat, medium heat or high heat. This pan is far lower quality cookware than our old inexpensive Emeril ware. I'd return it but I missed the window! I hope this helps others, as we are totally disgusted with this ""Clad Stainless Steel"" cookware."
large surface for cooking for a family
Ha
"There is no lid, as the description clearly indicates there should be!"
If using a stovetop cannot heat up to high. What's wrong with this description. Dishwasher safe for washing only - cannot leave in to dry. Good grief! Very disappointing.
"This product is low quality and totally over-priced. The pan is super sticky, even when you use plenty of oil. It is impossible to clean properly, even when applying steel wool! After a few weeks it is already stained and colored, no matter how hard I try to clean it. None of my other stainless steel products are sticky or need any special treatment when cleaning. Super disappointed."
"This pan is pretty heavy.  It heated evenly.  The first dish I made in it was a crispy chicken thigh w/ lemon.  With the right amount of oil, heated correctly, the thighs did not stick at all.  The pan took the transition to the oven very well.  Cleanup was very easy.  Excellent pan, especially considering the cost!!"
My father is happy with it. What more need I say?
The quality of the pan is really good.
Nothing about this pan have we disliked. It is very well made and for the money is of Higher Quality and a very good value. We use this pan Every day and it is easy to clean and heating the pan is easy and only takes a few seconds. We love the pan and plan to buy a smaller size and a larger size at some point. I almost forgot to mention the handle is very well attached which is a weakness on some pans. This one is attached with quality in mind. Would we purchase again! YES!
none
Super bueno
"I haven't had this pan for long, but it’s really nice. I seasoned it upon receiving it and it became amazingly non-stick and trouble free. The heat transfer is consistent and the craftsmanship is better than I expected. Kudos to you Amazon!"
"I've loved and admired Le Creuset for decades but just never bought any. The price, for one thing. The weight, for another. I just always loved how beautiful enameled cast iron cookware is but thought it was too heavy to be practical. And the price was just a big fat nope. I've cooked with two different enamelware pans now and while I love the dutch oven for the capacity, I am in total infatuation with this casserole/braiser. It's perfect for just about anything, it's essentially a skillet without a long handle. It's perfect for simmering, I've fried chicken and burgers in it, it's shallow enough that it's perfect to evaporate liquidy dishes. Perfect for gravy and sauces. Yes, the weight is an issue if you have nerve problems or back problems or any physical limitations, I'm not gonna lie. I probably can't use this when I'm 80 or 90. But the way these pans conduct heat, so evenly...and a lot easier to get stuff out of than just plain cast iron. It's like cast iron PLUS. Can't dishwasher them but they clean up with a nylon scrubby or brush if you need to. Stuck or burnt on food comes off with Barkeeper's Friend (and any marks that may have gotten on the porcelain) The bonus for me is they are so beautiful they sit on my hutch like display pieces. Just overall so happy with these, the lids fit perfectly and the hardware is solid (no loose screws which is so common and drives me nuts) I am beyond happy with how well food cooks in them. I like that I can pop the lid off this 'casserole' and put it on a metal trivet on my table and it's a built in serving dish. The closest Le Creuset to this is $269. (I found one over $300) I'm perfectly happy with this piece and I'm already looking at a few more pieces, at a price that isn't Le Unbelievable!"
"This is big, beautiful and heavy! I’ve been cooking and baking everything in it. Great price for such a versatile piece. No chips or quality issues with mine."
"For the price, this is just outstanding. It looks and cooks great. The only downside is that on the knob it says “amazon basics” in block print. It isn’t the name I don’t like, I’m not pretending it’s something else, I just wish the design og the printing was a little more attractive. It just looks slapped on there. A minor point. Overall, fantastic."
"Love this pan. Some reviewers are saying it's difficult to clean, which surprises me. When food gets stuck on the bottom I soak it in warm soapy water then rub it right off. (Magic erasers are helpful.) Other customers have complained that it is not white. They are correct. It's ivory. My only concern is that there are already chips in the enamel (2 on the base, 1 on the rim) after only a few months of use. I wash it by hand and I don't stack any other pans in or on it. For comparison, I also have a 15-year old Creuset piece which was gifted to me (Creuset is well beyond my budget) and there isn't a chip on it after all these years. So I'm a little concerned about the durability. Otherwise it heats evenly and cleans easily. As long as the enamel lasts I'll be happy with it."
"Finally! A piece of crockery that I love! I do a lot of Bavarian countryside cooking - sausage and chicken heavy, etc. so naturally I’m often in the market for a top notch cast iron crock. MUST have enamel - won’t even without outer AND inner enamel, since it is actually physically IMPOSSIBLE to clean or even DRY a non-enamel cast iron (for reasons that pertain to ferrous properties, d-orbitals and valence shell behavior that unfortunately I don’t have the time in this short review to fully discuss!). I opened my newest crockery (cast iron, mind you) and was immediately attracted to the soft cream color. My Le Cruesets are all bold colors. Enough! I do not need to be cooking “provincial sausage and herbs (with chicken)” in a lime green monstrosity thatbdiesnt even circulate heat properly - ceramics!!! Heat circ here: brilliant. Browned my euro-style heavy salted goat butter in under a minute. This is a fine piece and will likely be ordering more in the very near term!"
"I really love cooking with this, you can get stuff really hot and seared… And even if it looks like it’s badly burnt, it will clean up very easily. I might have to soak it overnight but it will clean up, but be kind to the enamel and don’t scratch it up.  The lid fits nice and tight and it’s really very solid and very attractive. I wish they made a smaller one that I could use for dips, it makes it a little bit easy to travel with it as this one is quite heavy."
"I'm so happy with this skillet. I own a Le Creuset 9 quart dutch oven that was gifted to me 15 years ago which i love and won't let any family member use since they're careless cleaning. I wanted a smaller one for day to day meals and decided to give this one a try. I've used it 5 times and treat it just like my LC. The key to easy cleaning after you use it (I browned chicken in mine and there was brown bits stuck on it) is to add warm water to the skillet after you've removed the food and let it boil gently to release the bits. It does come off and then after 3 min or so, i turn the heat off and let it sit there a little longer while i'm cleaning up. Then wash normal with dawn dish detergent and it comes out spotless. Just so you know it's normal to eventually have brown shadowing over time. The Le Creuset does the same thing - its normal. Very happy, and the off white, creamy color is also pretty. I prefer it over the stark white that some people mentioned they would have wanted."
Got it two days ago. I used it to made Arroz Con Pollo tonight. It worked perfectly well.
"I've seen several reviews complaining that everything cooked sticks to this pot. That's because enabled cast iron is NOT NON-STICK. Just like when you cook in stainless steel cookware, you must add either liquid or oil when using enameled cast iron. So why use enameled cast iron? You use it for it's superior and even heat conduction as well as the easy cleanup caused by the enamel. But be careful not to chip the enamel because uncoated cast iron easily rusts and just like non-enamled cast iron, will need to be seasoned on the exposed iron to keep rust at bay. I clean mine with dish soap and water. Once I remove the food from the pot, I immediately pour in some boiling water and a few drops of dish soap while the pot is still hot. After I eat, the pot is cooled down so I wash it by hand with dish soap and warm water. Please avoid washing a hot enameled pot because the cooler dish water will cause the enamel to ""craze"" (develop fine lines and cracks). With proper care, this pot will last and look brand new forever..."
This is my second purchase of this pan. My daughter loved my first one so much that she took it! This matte white color is gorgeous. The pan is so versatile we use it almost exclusively.
I rarely splurge on cookware and try to make do with what I already have BUT after looking at this forever I'm so glad i finally bought it! Use it ALL the time! I have the blue and the quality is EXCELLENT and arrived quickly and well packaged. I cook ALL the time now and my big dutch oven is very big and not right for many things. I have used this casserole for curries and shepherd's pies and breakfast casseroles (stradas.) With shepherd's pies I can just use this one pan to brown meat and saute veg and bring those altogether and just make the mash separate and pop into oven...looks beautiful on the table too! Clean up is a breeze...soapy water and nylon scrubby. This pan is a work horse and you will find many ways to use it-ENJOY!
This little porcelain clad cast iron is versatile and gets the job done! Pretty easy to clean and non stick with proper use. Just don’t drop it or knock it around as the porcelain chips way easier than it would if you even just spent $30 more and bought the Lodge pan of similar shape and size which I also own. Very pretty to look at and elegant shape plus a huge variety of colors makes this pan a glorious deal! Just hand wash it and be gentle with it if you don’t want chips and you’ll have a piece that could last a lifetime in your kitchen.
"Purchased on Amazon Prime Day & got an amazing deal!! I was looking for an enamel cast iron skillet, but when I saw the prices that they typically go for, I was weary. Then I found Amazonbasics. Everything I have purchased from this Amazon brand has been amazing, including this skillet. I already put it to use and made a chicken pot pie with it! Came out perfect! I cooked the inside filling first and nothing got stuck to the pan like others have mentioned. I have no complaints & I love the blue color! Now I want to purchase the matching Amazonbasics Dutch oven pot!"
"I have been wanting something like this for a long time. This one really caught my eye and when I read a review where the customer was disappointed with the color, she thought it was going to be white and it wasn't that's when I ordered it right away because I knew it was cream and that's exactly the color I wanted. It is so beautiful, every dish I make my family comments on how pretty the food looks and it tastes great too. The pot's craftmanship is impeccable it's made so well. It hasn't chipped, I've never burned anything and it's so easy to clean. You name it I've made it whether it's a stovetop dish, oven dish or both my dinners turn out great! When I wash it, it looks like new. I LOVE it!!!!"
"I use this type product in various brands all the time. First, the green brassier is absolutely beautiful. I checked out the weight of the lid. It is quite heavy which is desirable for holding the steam in this low pan. The iron between the enamel is compressed really well making the heat holding quality good. If the enamel is a good quality and it appears to be, this will be a jewel and another favorite to cook in. I will have further information after using it. But my experience with a good enameled iron pot has always been good. I have a 5 qt brassier which is good for more than two and I wanted to down-size for smaller amounts. This one is a gift to me from my husband and I think anyone would like to get one if they like to cook and be creative."
"Package arrived in good shape. I chose white because that was all that was available and i like it. Its a creamy white. Used it 4 times and it is very good. It is heavy, but it is enameled so treat it as if it were glass. When cleaning, wait for it to cool and fill it with warm soapy water for a bit. Dry this pan completely! Allowing the pan to heat slowly to a moderate temp will give greatest success as it holds heat well. I would imagine this pan is not as high quality as Le Creuset, but its plenty good enough to give many many years of reliable service. Just treat it gently."
Arrived on time and packaging was exceptional. Very heavy and sturdy product. I love it and can't wait to use it. Will provide update Ina couple of months on its durability. So far very impressed!!
"This casserole skillet is a great choice for those of us who simply can’t afford, or don’t wish to spend so much on a piece of Le Creuset cookware. I have no negatives regarding this item. It heats evenly, cooks beautifully, & cleans easily. I make sure to use silicone or bamboo utensils when cooking, & anticipate using this casserole skillet for years to come. It arrived well packaged & in perfect condition."
"I’ve wanted a pan aa such for years, after stopping on more than one occasion at a factory, I did get one, an Amazon Basics vs the factory from where I wanted to purchase. I love this pan, as far as I see in using it, it’s only a difference in brand I love this pan. No reasoning to believe it’s a “basic” product.  I used this pan the afternoon/evening we received it,, Meat (stir fry) came together so quickly and tasteful, along with the other ingredients. Rice. Tomatoes, onion, etc. I cannot Believe I put off a purchase as this for so long."
"I absolutely love this thing. It heats perfectly and distributes it well. It's so versatile. It can easily go from browning food on the stovetop directly into the oven to bake. It also looks pretty for presentation on the table. Negatively, it does take a little more effort to clean than my other enameled Dutch oven but if you put some water in it, bring it to a boil and let it soak, it comes clean fairly easily. Another negative for some might be the weight. It's pretty heavy but that's actually what I love about it. You can't have a light cast iron pan."
"Bought it on a discount during Prime day. Love it so much I would have gladly paid full price for it. I can cook anything in it. When it is harder to clean, like if I pan-fry steaks, I just put a little baking soda on my sponge and anything that has stuck comes right off. Love it so much I bought the Dutch oven to match"
"I've used this zero times, but my wife is literally over the moon about it (NOTE: She is not literally over the moon, which should be obvious, but I wanted to give fellow grammar nerds a bit of a shiver). She has told me literally (this time I mean it) six times that this is the greatest piece of kit she has ever owned. Considering we're constantly buying pots and pans and skillets and doodads, I'd say it was quite a successful purchase."
"I wanted a cast iron casserole dish to cook with, but didn't want to pay for the expensive ones. I love this Amazon Basics skillet! It's heavy and cooks well. It's been easy to clean so far. I mostly use it on the stovetop, but I have done a couple of stovetop to over dishes and they've gone well. The biggest issue I have is how to store it when not using it since I'm a little limited on space. Still love it though. It would definitely make a good gift for someone who loves to cook or is setting up a new/first house."
"It arrived on time and packaged very well. It was in excellent condition. I like cooking with cast iron, although I don't like the maintenance bare cast iron requires, that's why I buy the enameled cast because it is a lot easier to clean. this skillet is no light weight, because of the size and thickness of the metal it is heavy as it should be to keep the heat. I particularly like the curved bottom because the bottom corners are easy to scrape when you stir. we have used it multiple times since receiving it."
"LOVE this pan. It arrived quickly, in perfect shape. The color is beautiful and the size is perfect for cooking for two or a crowd. Cleans up in a breeze. I can wait to get another pan in another color to go with this gorgeous blue and the yellow dutch oven that I already have. My kitchen is a happy place!!! I can recommend this pan without hesitation. I just don't want to put it away!!! Get it...you won't be sorry!!!"
Used it last night for dinner. Some of the rice got stuck to the bottom but it was very easy to clean.
"This is a great casserole dish. Very heavy and just the right size for roasting chicken or making delicious potatoes au gratin. It cleans up very easily, conducts heat well, and is a lovely color! (I have the green one.) I have three enameled cast iron dutch ovens, and love them. They are all expensive brands. This one compares easily with them in quality. Nice job, Amazon Basics!"
"This pan is beautiful, and cooks really well, cleans nicely, and is a good value for the money. This is an update: I love this pan, it is so versatile. Also, it isn't quite as heavy and cumbersome as the lodge brand enameled cast iron I own. I have been using this daily, sometimes for two meals a day, washes up so easily, cooks evenly, I highly recommend."
"I've been looking for enameled cast iron for long time. Obviously Le creuset, Staub, and more are so so so expensive I couldn't afford it and I really do not want to spend so much money for just cookware. This is amazing. it costs less than $50 and quality of it is super nice! I got a Green one and I am super satisfied with this beautiful thing. Working great. Easy cleaning. Just happy cooking."
"I was a little hesitant to buy an “off brand” but this was the size/shape I was looking for.  I bought this for my mother as a bday gift. Compared to the other very expensive brand, this is excellent quality and has quickly become her most favorite piece of cookware. Super easy to clean and the size is great for so many different things.  For those who balk at the thought of dropping $100s on the name brand, but still want a fun, enamel piece, I think this is an excellent alternative for the price"
"This is a great value for an enameled cast iron pan. It's nice quality and cleans up easy. I bought the Dutch Oven first, and waited several months for this casserole to be available again. I was happy to get my hands on it. The only drawback is also one of it's best qualities. It's super heavy! That makes it difficult if you have trouble gripping or have a weight restriction, especially when it's full and HOT!"
This is just the right size if you are single or have a small family. It conducts heat well and cleans up easily. I purchased this in the matte navy and leave it out on the stovetop because it is so attractive.
"Love this purchase! It’s a great size, versatile, and looks expensive. Nice finish inside and out. Feels heavy duty. I have the Amazon brand Dutch oven and that’s held up just as well as my very expensive one. I’m excited to have this piece and plan to use it daily. Love the price point!"
I saw this skillet and had to have it! The color is amazing. It cooks things perfect. Heats up quick and things don't stick to it. It has been easy to clean. The only thing I wish is that they made different sizes so I could buy them all! Lol
"I LOVE this cast iron skillet/braiser. The quality for the price is AMAZING. I just used it to make a small batch of French onion soup, cleaned it, then popped it in the oven and roasted some chicken thighs. I own a Le Creuset Dutch Oven and the AmazonBasic line is just as good - way more affordable. I also have the 3.5 qt round pot. I highly recommend!"
I love this! The white is so pretty even just sitting out on the stove. It cooks food really well. The only down side is that it’s the second enamel covered pot I’ve purchased and food has stuck to the bottom of both on the first use. Haven’t had problems with it after the first use and clean. It’s nice and heavy and heats super fast
"I've bought 9 of these in different colors. Kept 1 , gifted the others. A bit heavy, but love cooking in them. Cleans easily."
"Love this pan! Went to cast iron because they are healthier, in my opinion. This pan is the very versatile and I use it for almost everything. Easy to clean...sometimes soaking required, but it cleans up great. Super affordable compared to other “brands” and great quality. I was lucky to have gotten mine on prime day but I would pay full price also."
A well made casserole. Does a good job of even heating with good amount of head retention. So far no chipping or discoloration.
I am glad that the negative review did not deter me from buying this pan. I have never had a pan so nice looking that I can just leave it on the stove top. I found that bleach will remove any discoloration. Love it!
Love this skillet! I brought this enameled covered skillet specially for a pot luck and it worked perfectly! I needed a pan that would go from stovetop to oven and this did the trick. It cooked evenly and I love that it has a lid. It is heavy but manageable. The coating makes cleaning a breeze. Highly recommend!!!!
I love this thing! It cooks evenly and it’s easy to clean. The fact that it is beautiful is just an added bonus
"I love mine! I see some other reviews say it is hard to clean but it's not at all. I have fried, boiled, baked, sauteed, and no problem cleaning. If you have to scrub too hard for your liking just heat some water up in it and stir the stuff off of the pot. I loved it so much I bought a pot to match it."
All the quality and performance of the expensive French enameled cast iron cookware at half the price…or less. VERY highly recommended.
I cooked in cast iron most all of my life and I love it you still have to cook for a lot of cowboys outside and it's absolutely lovely now with us enamel it is with the enamel it is just a pleasure and not only that it's pretty on the table too
I have used this pan several times now. Cleans up so nice and easy. I have sauteed veggies and meat. I have browned up meat and finished the dish in the oven. I have baked dishes in the oven. Great pan. Cleans up better than my big Lodge Pan.
"Great quality, size, weight! You will be very happy with your purchase of this braising pot!"
Really a nice skillet. Just as durable and handsome as Le Creuset. The only reason I downgraded it as a gift is because the stated brand on the lid is Amazon. I would recommend a tasteful logo or letter A. But for me this is a great buy.
I can't believe how great this casserole is - the cleanup is remarkable - every time I clean it I marvel. I have a french name brand pot and this is as good if not better! I use it all the time for eggplant parmesan. I simmer the marinara for 3 hours and then add the breaded eggplant. Pop it into the oven and it's just amazing! It's a truly versatile pot.
"I bought this as a Christmas gift so I am not sure about the functionality of it. However, it seems like it is great quality for the price. The coloring is exactly as I expected it to be. I believe the person I bought it for will be happy!"
"Love my brazier. Looks and feels like Le Creset for 1/3 the price. Great for me dish meals (chicken, Italian sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions, oregano, salt, pepper, little olive oil cream vet and pop in 350 degree oven for 45 to 60 minutes. Delicious with a gr is n salad."
I love the pan for the price! I had been wanting a Le Cruset but it’s too expensive for me right now. This pan is a perfect alternative and you can’t beat the price! I just wish it didn’t say Amazon Basics on the lid handle - a bit tacky. Otherwise it’s a great pan!!
I got this in white and am very pleased. I have a gas stove and I wanted something that could simmer On the stove for longer periods without burning it. This fits the bill to a tee. Cooks evenly and does not burn.
"I love this. Yes you need to be careful with it or it may chip. But that is standard with any enameled cast iron. The quality of these are as good as the higher priced, name brands."
"So excited to have found this AmazonBasic! I have the Le Cruset version which is a workhorse in my kitchen. I have come to love the versatility of this pan so much that I gift it whenever possible but it’s not often I can afford the sticker price of the Le Cruset!!! So to find this pan- same shape, same size is so great!! I gave it my mom and it has become the primary pan in her kitchen. Can’t wait to gift this to others!! Ps. Could we have more color options?"
"This braiser is perfect for the kind of cooking I do: lots of curries & other stews. It cleans up beautifully and easily. Not all the amazon basics are winners, but this one is in my book."
Homerun!! This review is easy! Sorry if I sound like a commercial!!! But I love my pot! I already have the Dutch Oven version in the same color! I’ll never go back to ordinary pots and pans again!
Great for braising.
"I've purged all non-stick cookware from my kitchen. I ordered this instead of constantly having to pamper my other cast iron pans, love it! So easy and gives me a piece of mind that I no longer have toxic chemicals leaching into my food from the non-stick pans!"
"Love the super vintage look and the cost effective price. It works as well so far as my LaCreuset and way better than plain cast iron. It does have Amazon basics stamped on the knob which is kind of a drag but, oh well. Love it!"
"I needed an affordable, versatile skillet and this was perfect. I’ve made everything from steak to pasta to chicken and it gets the job done and cleans up beautifully."
I had no idea Amazon had such quality cookware. It’s a staple in the kitchen
Baked a peach cobbler in the oven using this skillet. Clean up good. Very pretty in blue ombré color.
I love this! I use it several times a week for dishes I need to sauté and brown on the stove then finish off in the oven.
Really nice item. Looks great and cleans easily. Quality is comparable to Le creuset: but not quite as heavy and the enamel finish may discolor slightly vs. Le creuset. Great gift item.
"I LOVE my set I got for myself. Very easy to clean. I'll update on the durability question, since I got them not too long ago, I could not answer that Q. But it IS a GREAT product. Way to go Amazon, Thank you."
"It is like Le Creuset, for a fraction of the price. Came out to be as expected. I only used it for sauteeing & cooking on induction stove top. I don’t used it for baking in oven. So far, it is holding really well. Satisfied consumer."
This has become my go-to pan for just about everything! I love it! The heat distribution is amazing. No more hot spots!!
"This dish is more than beautiful. I gave it as a gift, and the person says it's too pretty to cook in. They want to find a way to display it."
"I love this dutch oven style pan, the size is nice and big and I love that you can bake up 400 degrees too - it's pretty to display as well"
"I bought this to replace another non-stick pan that had become pro-stick after a few months. I've learned that you shouldn't overheat the pans and you shouldn't use Pam or similar sprays. Perhaps it's my own education that has allowed me to keep the pan really non-stick, but I've found this pan performs much better than more expensive options. I bought this because I did a search for ""best non-stick pans"" and found Amazon Basics on the list. My experience is that this really does the job."
"Works well for cooking of the food, but makes a poor hat"
Cleanup is easy and the pan is not too heavy.
OK if your looking for a realy good coated frying pan this is the one. good pan at a good price. but remember this. use ONLY PLASTIC OR WOOD .when mixing i know because this is my second pan. the first one i said it will be ok if i just give it a quick stir with this metal poon. well guess what i scratched it. then i threw it out. now i learned my lesson . ONLY PLASTIC OR WOOD. very good pan.
Paint is already coming off of the bottom after one use. It stuck to my oven top.
These pans are not worth your time. look at my other reviews for the one that I liked recently.
Easy clean up.Only problem is that I cannot find a 1 inch lid
"This pan is a good size, the weight is comfortable, I've had it for several weeks and use it many times a day. The non stick is great"
This is a very nice a stick big fry pan. Keep in mind it is extra big. Nicely washes clean!
Finish already coming off of pan bottom.
exactly as described.
"Have had the skillet about 1-1/2 months and this week the paint began to come off the bottom of the skillet when cooking with low and moderate heat. Very disappointed, especially since happened not long after the deadline to return or exchange."
Cooks fine. Paint peeled off of the bottom on the first use.
"Pan is large, and price good. Only problem I am having is the paint is coming off bottom. It is all over electric cook top."
Really does work as advertised
I put this pan on the stove and turned on the heat and put some food in it and it cooked it on the first try. Unbelievable.
It burns your food and the color quickly turn black Absolutely a waste of money! No good
Haven’t had the pan for that long yet really. So far so good. Seems to be a decent quality. Love the size and that it has a handle that stays cool!
Just as described. I use it for everything now.
I like frying taters and it fits good on the stove
I wish it came with a lid
Frying calves and beef liver.
"Good pan… until it started to burn on the bottom! I don’t really expect a non stick pan to last forever, but it should last longer than 3 months! At this price I guess it’s not bad but it’s not recommended."
first use was fried fish and it got stuck on the first use
Paint chipped within one week
"It’s easier to clean than a normal pan, but it is a far cry from being non stick"
Please be aware this pan will not work with induction ranges. I didn’t discover this until after it arrived.
This Amazon basics skillet cooks better than a name brand skillet and nothing sticks to it! This is the best skillet I’ve ever purchased in my life! I purchase this skillet over and over again!!!
"I have cooked on this for about a week and so far the food has come out really well! The heat distribution is pretty good and it's pretty easy to clean afterward. The pan is pretty big, which was very useful for my needs compared to my previous 10-inch skillet. I really like the rubber handle, the only thing I wish it came with was a lid, but I can't complain."
Great product at a great price and fast shipping
May be a good pan if the outside coating didn't chip off at the first use. Threw it in the garbage because it is a fire hazard.
"Nice large skillet. Seasoned like the directions said to. Pretty red. Nonstick cooking and easy clean-up!!! Do not use metal spatulas in this...get yourself a good melamine or silicone one. I ordered ""used like new"", and it arrived brand new. Excellent value!"
Cooks great.
Très grande poêle mais la peinture dessous semble décoller a la cuisson. Première utilisation et assez satisfait (update) mais ouverture très grande et difficile pour trouver un couvercle.
The product looks great but from my experience the turquoise color came out after the first use itself. I am not at all satisfied with this product.
"A very good product. Been using a lot of other ""Branded"" products and this beats them hands down. The non stick coating is excellent saving is a lot of oil."
Superbly sturdy and has good weight.. loved the 32 cms one..don't find them easily.
Great quality
Sehr schöne antihaft beschichtung
Superb definitely u can buy it
Damn gud
Good quality and Greta design.
"ok, firstly..i like my omlet to be cooked in good amount of oil. of u see the pics, the oil has setteled on the sides which only means thz pan is puffed up from the center which dzfeats the pupose of mqkin a perfect omlet. i made 4eggs omlet which u see in pic as i like to cook at one go. fliping an omlet this size on a huge pan like this is not easy but i do it as i have good practice. the flipped omlet pic if u see the center the round circle is dry coz of the puffed up pan. again ..the idea of makin a perfect omlet is defeated. in this case 4months down the line the puffed up center of the pan will be spoiled and the onlet will stick to it nd burn. amazon needs to fix this problem as the oil needs to stay in center, coz when u pour the omlet whip into the pan with the oil in center, the omlet whip spreads the oil evenly to all corners. simple basic dyanamic as they work in tandem. im not happy with this pan hence im returning it."

Despite there is ceramic word in the title this pan has no ceramic surface to cook at. Returned.
Very useful and easy to clean
"A very big size pan with good fit and finish from Amazon, the only reason it gets 4 stars because of the absense of an induction base"
"Die Pfanne liegt leider nicht plan auf dem Ceranfeld auf und wackelt darauf herum, daher ist die Wärmeverteilung nicht sehr homogen. Darüber hinaus blättert der rote Lack nach paar Mal benutzen ab. Meine Erwartungen waren jetzt nicht besonders hoch, aber zumindest die basics sollte eine Pfanne schon können, insbesondere Plan aufliegen auf dem Herd. Schade, ansonsten wirkt sie optisch schön und der Griff liegt gut in der Hand, nutzt halt leider wenig."
Super
Good

"This is best you can get. Large , efficient and durable."
Frying pan
Ut is really good and very big.
"I've had Ozeri products before and liked them a lot. This pan is a huge disappointment. After less than 4 months of us there is bubbling in multiple places across the bottom of the pan. We use it normally on the stovetop with wooden or plastic utensils (never metal), and never used it in the oven."
"I used this on low heat many times, never used metal utensils, and washed when cooled. Now it's discolored and the nonstick coating is ""falling apart."" Disappointing!"
"I am the home cook, cooking for my wife for a' 57 years now. What I am impressed with? Got the 12"" Ozeri pan yesterday and used it today for the first time. It is replacement for 12 pan from our fancy Anolon Nouvelle Copper Hard-Anodized Nonstick Cookware set that we bought in March 2017. The Anolon pans are ""slow"" to heat on the Induction cooking surface, and the pans got scratched pretty quickly. Especially the 12 inch one. But this babe gets hot 2 to 3 times faster than the Anolon! I recommend to use at least one click lower temp than you are used to. Also, their surface protection green pad is nifty. Especially because my wife loves to stack everything on top of each other. Closet pyramid builder she is; or not... I usually publish critiques; praise like this one is rare from me.  One shortcoming - silicone handle and stone finish: the seller needs to publish maximum temperature for this family of cooking pans. Silicone? 450 or 500F??? What is the thermal expansion limit for the stone finish??"
"Never seen eggs glide off without even touching it yet. I have more expensive pots and pans, but they are not non-stick. I needed this for eggs, but you can use it for stir fry and everything else. Please remember to use medium heat and preheat a couple of minutes before cracking your eggs into it. Using medium and maybe occasionally medium high for short times will avoid users who experience discoloring of the pans. Browning pans happen on frequent high heat with non-stick and non-metal pans, but you don’t realize it because most non-stick pans are coated black. Medium heat is key. Also, read the instructions and season the pan before use. That just means a very light coating of oil is spread on the inside of the pan before each use. You can use less oil (good for health) and even distribution by spreading the oil (coating the inside) with a very small amount of paper towel/napkin or cooking brush. I promise you your eggs will fly off haha. It is a joy to use."
"This pan is amazing as long as you pay attention to the included instructions. Non-stick is not a marketing slogan here, unlike my other ""non-stick"" pans . Remember that this pan is great for what it's great for, but it can't do everything & isn't designed to be your primary pan. I use it to make things that don't need added fat for flavor & cook at medium to low temperature. Eggs, dark-meat chicken and naturally fattier cuts of meat & fish have never been this healthy & comparatively low-calorie. I actually taste my food instead of unnecessary butter or oil.  Keep in mind that the coating doesn't hold up past medium temperature settings or with metal utensils, so the pan can be ruined by a careless cook. I don't ever put it higher than 6 on my electric range and haven't had any issues. In fairness, I'm not certain how it would work with a gas flame.  These pans (I have two sizes so far) help me eat healthier & I've even had some modest weight loss. Apparently a lot of extra calories hide in butter and oil and it makes a difference for me. I'd strongly recommend anyone interested in health(ier) cooking give these a try."
"When I first got this I was ecstatic. Food just slides right off, even eggs. So easy to clean. BUT, I was washing it the other day (always hand wash my pots n pans) I noticed that the coating is getting shallow surface scratches and I ONLY ever use plastic/wood/silicone utensils in my pots. So this has me concerned, why is it scratching so easily? How long will it last before the food starts to stick? Great pan and I love it, just wish the coating was more durable.  Update: 8-28-19 Still has the surface scratches but food is still sliding right off, so updated to 5 stars. Seems to be holding up great."
"I was tired of everything usually sticking in ""non-stick"" pans. This one is so AWESOME. Perfect for cooking any thing you don't want to stick, for me its Corned Beef Hash. And for eggs, and anything that usually sticks literally slides out. Give the eggs about 2 mins or so let them set a bit and you can swirl them around in the pan. Get the Lid too. I don't understand why they sell them separate other than pure marketing. But it's nice to have for different things you cook. AND, it comes with a felt circle for the pan surface so you can set other pans on it and possibly scratch it. My husband is not allowed to touch it or use it. I only wash it by by hand, there's no need to put in the dishwasher. Water, soapy dishrag and just wipe it out. I've gone on enough."
"This pan is much better than I expected it to be. I cannot answer for any of the negative reviews that have been posted, but my little boy scrambled some eggs in this pan using a fork and scratched the hell out of it and none of the surface broke, flaked or cracked. It's in perfect working order and has been since the day I bought it nearly 10 months ago. The surface has some discoloration in it but that is due entirely to the fact that my family does not know how to NOT use high heat when cooking. They are idiots. Don't be like them. I just ordered a second one and I am completely confident that these are going to be some of the best frying pans you've ever used."
"It’s been 363 days since ordering this pan. Without hesitation this is the best frying pan we’ve owned. Food doesn’t stick due to its no-stick coating which makes it extremely easy to clean and means it does not require a lot of butter or oil to cook with! I had some oil/grease and food spatter spill over the side which caused it to stick to the bottom of the pan. With most pans you’ll never get that off without scratching the bottom of the pan, not with this pan! This pan also works on an induction stove and comes with a protective pad to put inside the pan when storing it and so another pan setting in it won’t scratch the coating. Always use wooden or rubber utensils when cooking with any pot/pan.  So why did it take me almost a year to write a review? Well... because I’m on here to order more, preferably a set. Helps that you also get to read a “long term” review."
"I truly have never cooked with a pan this amazing. Absolutely nothing will stick, and I mean nothing!!! The clean up is insanely easy, I received a 10” pan as a gift and just bought the 12” pan because I loved it so much. This pan makes cooking a breeze and cuts your clean up in half - you will never have to soak this pan, everything just comes off with water. Not to mention the pans are very aesthetically pleasing. Can’t wait to get my hands on the sauce pan when it’s back in stock!!"
"I have used this pan everyday now for 10 days. When I first got it i rubbed 1 teaspoon of oil into the pan with a paper towel to remove any excess, as the manufacturer suggested to ""season"" the pan. I also never put the heat fully to medium on my gas stove as the manufacturer warns against high heat - the pans really hold the heat evenly and higher heat is completely unnecessary. I use mostly medium - low heat on a large burner (for the 12"" pan) Since then I have cooked eggs, meats, vegetables, sauces, risotto, gnocchi all with NO oil/butter/cooking sprays added to the pan. Everything has cooked perfectly. Eggs slide out of the pan. Meats obtain a nice crusty sear without sticking at all to the pan. I just ordered the 5 quart sauce pan because I am so impressed with this pan. I hope they hold up long term, but at this point it is certainly the BEST pan I have ever purchased. I previously bought ""the green pan"" ceramic coated pans and they were terrible- everything stuck to them. To be clear, this is my own honest review, I paid full price for the pan and I have received nothing in return. They are just such excellent pans I had to share."
"This pan has become the pan of choice to use in my household. I bought the 12"" pan which gives me more than enough space to cook comfortably. There is no doubt that it is non-stick and easy to clean, it doesn't take much effort to wash all the food off. It tells you how to care for it so if I follow that, I think the pan will last a good amount of time."
I’ve only used a few times so far but it’s good. It’s a beautiful skillet. Cleans easily. The only prep prior to initial use was to clean and smear a little oil in it. It has a nice weight to it as well. I used an old glass cover from another 12” pan and it fits perfect. I like that it doesn’t have any forever chemicals in it such as Teflon.
"First off, the inside of the pan is very pretty. Just having it around makes your kitchen look nicer. It's a very pleasant design on both the top and bottom. The material is thick, making the pan feel heavy, solid, and sturdy. Despite its thickness, it conducts heat extremely well, so it doesn't need a high setting to cook well. The no-stick coating works extremely well, though you should avoid metal utensils like the plague with it. Keep them as far away as possible; use a silicon spatula or something to stir or remove food. No idea what ""stone-derived"" means, but it seems to be just a PTFE coating. Avoid the Stone Earth lid, though; seems it doesn't hold up to heat well and has straight-up exploded. The pan is fine, however, and easy to recommend."
I'd love these type of pans. I always do my research before buying a simple one. My last pan had a non-stick issue and I replaced with this pan. So far I enjoy it. wish I'd got a different colour though. current one make my pam blend in with the pan. Cooked mostly pork and Steak so far. Very easy to clean.
"I’m so glad I splurged for the expensive, nice pan! I bought a nonstick pan not even 6 months ago and it is already ruined. Instead of buying a cheap one again I went with this one and I’m glad I did! I’ve only had it for about a month but use it all the time. Nothing sticks and it honestly makes life easier. I read the reviews which said make sure to follow the directions - coat the pan with oil first use, don’t use high heat and don’t use metal spatulas. I’ve been doing that and it’s still like new! If it starts wearing away soon I’ll come back and let you all know. :)"
"This pan is great! If you follow the instructions on how NOT to ruin the finish you will be fine. I've had it about a month and use it a lot and have to say, it cleans beautifully, it cooks very evenly, and it is nice to look at! Follow the simple care instructions and you'll have a favorite pan in your life forever!"
"The non-stick coating works very well, and it is reassuring that it does not contain the contaminates we've learned about. (I have hope that it will last as advertised.) The heat distributes so nicely - no matter where it sits on the heating element. We use induction cooking, and it works perfectly. The pan is sturdy, and looks really nice. It is refreshing to have the option for an inside pan color (we got the white) that really shows the food while we're cooking. I hope the company develops more pan size options to sell!"
"You know your priorities in life are shifting when you get excited about a cooking utensil but I love this pan. It's solidly well made and packaged with care. Do read the instructions and, if you don't know how to season a pan, you might want to head for YouTube University for a refresher.  Seasoned properly this will quickly become your favorite pan and, at $29, it's a bargain. Highly recommend."
"I absolutely love this pan. We needed something that would not warp when using high heat a lot of times. This pans fits that need. It is very easy to clean. It is very sturdy, you can tell it is from the weight. The pan is not super super heavy but it is heavier than regular ceramic pans. I have owned stainless steel and ceramic and this is the perfect of all. It is pricey, but like mamma use to say ""you get what you pay for"". If you are one the fence about a pan this would probably be the best for you. I am picky about cookware and use these reviews when purchasing products, so I write it like it is. Enjoy."
This has been a good frying pan. I have used it 10 plus times and it is just like new. Nothing sticks to the pan! Not a single scratch on the coating either. I have cook things at very high temps as well with no troubles. I was a little worried after reading other reviews but now that I have used it I have had not a single problem with this pan. It has been a good buy for me.
"Is there a better pan?? I've purchased cheap, high end and in between quality pans, this is the best. period. Nothing sticks, ever! Very thick bottom does not warp like many non-stick pans I own. Lower heat than normal needed, washing takes moments no matter how crusty, dirty etc... I've owned it for months and its still like new. I will buy the complete set when available."
"I’ve been using this pan for a month now and I’m so happy with it:) I’ve cooked just about everything I can on it and nothing has stuck to it. I do hand wash 🧼 no dishwasher, even tho you can if you want to. I have carpal tunnel and the pan it self is not to heavy. Which is really great 👍 I have also used metal spatulas in it and no scratches! Thank you for this pan, finally something that works"
No need for any oil when cooking. Food just does not stick and I am including cheese. Cooks evenly. I love the fact that they send an insert to place on top of the pan when you are storing it to keep it from getting scratched.
"My wife and I cook a great deal, and we needed to replace our non-stick pans. So we experimented by purchasing several types of non-sticks.  Our primary test was cooking an egg over easy without any butter or oil. Ozeri Stone Earth was the only pan that did not stick.  Other features of Ozeri Stone Earth that beat out the others: * An even temperature over the entire cooking surface. * Deep bottom, which makes it excellent for making sauces. * Ergonomic handle, which made it comfortable to work with, especially when making crepes.  We ended up purchasing two 12-inches, two 10-inches, and an 8-inch. We are never using anything else."
"This pan is amazing! I was searching for something like this for a long time, it's worth the price and works so well with food. I can finally cook multiple things in one pan. The best part is the slick surface, I make scrambled eggs with often cheese and no sticking at all! Highly recommend!"
"Pan looks nice and performs very well. I like that the bottom of the pan is not ridged or sharp, If you have a glass cooktop this will be easier on it than other pans I have used. I wish the pan came with a lid option. I'd also love a full set of this pan!"
"I love this pan. The pan this replaced was part of a pretty expensive emiril anodized aluminum (spelling?) set that barely lasted a year before the surface became damaged from use. Apparently this releases chemicals under heat so we had to throw it away. I don’t see that happening with this one. Very even heat distribution, and our stove top isn’t the greatest so we struggle with this. Only downside is you have to buy the top separately."
"This is an absolutely NON-STICK pan and SO easy to clean. One time I forgot that I had it cooking on the stove, by the time I smelled the burn, the dumplings in the pan were all burnt. However, the burnt food didn't stick to the pan at all, and was easily removed with my silicon spatula. The pan was easily cleaned and with no trace of burnt food or scratch at all. So glad that I bought this pan!"
I bought three sizes of these pans. Love them. They heat better than my last pans and the surface is awesome. Wish I had discovered these years ago. They come with felt surface protectors which is a nice bonus. Take care of them and I suspect this will last for years.
i have had my 12 inch for a while now holds up very nice and very easy to clean which is really nice for me im pretty disabled. So this is very helpful to me i decided today im getting another 10 inch to go with my 12 inch
"I have 2 of this brand skillet. Very well made, works well. I like them."
"I looove this pan! I bought it on Nesha’s Recomendation from Rainbow plant life. I have never loved a pan before. Lol’d. You can just feel the quality of craftsmanship. I also have never taken such good care of a pan before, it commands respect and care. I am a big believer in quality over quantity. Buying well made kitchen gear and only having essentials. This is an essential!"
"Best non stick ever. Comes with 10 commandments, lol, what to do and what not to do! Clean with a soft sponge. You won’t be disappointed if you treat it right"
"holy crap I've had this pan for a couple weeks now and it's the best pan I've owned in my life. We're very thrifty and we use objects until they're on their last leg, but we desperately needed a new pan, as our old one (from Target) was losing the handle and bits of black stuff from the coating were coming off. With this new pan, even when we burn sugary sauce, everything scrapes off really easily, making clean up super fast and smooth. If it holds up a couple months from now I'll probably replace our other pan with this brand (our other old Target pan's starting to lose the handle too haha) 11/10"
"Heat distribution is mindblowing Very easy to clean Minimal or even no oil needed Add couple drops of oil and wipe the surface with paper towel, thats it It impresses me everytime i use it Never got anything burned on it I keep it on medium to med-low heat and its awesome , heats up pretty quick Use care when cleaning it , and only silicon utensils"
"not sure why this has mixed reviews. If you use a soft sponge to clean it and do not use metal utensils, this pan holds up great! I hand wash my pans and knives because I don't trust my dishwasher, so that may be why others had issues?  overall awesome pan, heats evenly and has a good spread. really wish it came with a lid though"
"Purchased this 12"" pan a year ago. Love it for eggs, meat, fish, cheese and pancakes. Nothing sticks! We make cheese crisps and they slide right out. Very little - if any - oil is needed. You must hand wash but that's not difficult when everything comes out with a water rinse. Will be looking to get a 10"" pan soon to accompany my daily used workhorse pan."
This pan is heavier than I anticipated. It cleans easily. Does not take as much heat to fry your item. It does not come with a lid.
"Made this purchase in November 2018. Use on the average of twice a day for everything from eggs, fish, sausage and anything else you can think of. This is a great pan !!! Read the directions !!! It requires a lower heat, but transfers heat rapidly. Been using for about 5 -6 months now and highly recommend this product, Have the 12 inch pan going to orderr the 10 inch also."
I love how solid it feels. It worked great. And it was very easy to clean. I immediately put it to use when I got it. Hope its durable.
"So far, this pan has been the most easy-to-clean of any type. Foods that would normally stick and make a mess have not done so in this pan. Also, has washed well in the dishwasher to this point."
"We LOVE this pan! Not as heavy as cast iron, but seems to function similarly, and I care for it similarly. I seasoned it before first use and after most uses thereafter. Often i can just wipe it clean, or use some boiling water to loosen particles if I need."
I really like this pan. It cleans exceptionally well and it's size makes frying anything a breeze. The huge amount of directions were the first for me. I usually buy the granite ones. If you want a great pan that's easy to clean then get this one.
"I bought this pan second time, my old one was about 4 + years old, it was time to go... I love the quality , how easy to clean and for the long lasting results. I used this pan at least 3 times a week for many years and it's served me SO good. I have induction stove, and it's hard to find good stuff. I tried to find something new, but nothing attracted me , so bought the same kind one.. I don't know or its works and last the same on other type of stoves, but works well on induction . Price is fair for this quality."
"This pan has become my absolute favorite nonstick pan to date. It heats well, cooks food evenly and is TRULY nonstick. Cleaning it is an absolute breeze. And I love most that it is chemical free. This pan is amazing!"
Bought similar Chinese product get sticky after two month. But this one works very well so far and never has sticky eggs on the pan. Will refer to friends
I really love this pan. I bought it because I don’t want to cook on Teflon anymore and it says it is natural but when it arrived it has a sticker on it that says the name of a coating that it has. I guess I’ll just take my chances with it. Works great and a quick rinse is literally all it needs. You never have to scrub this thing even when you burn something in it.
Easy to season and clean. Great so far. And doesn't stink when heated like my old Green Pan.
"Best pan purchase I have ever made. Slight discoloration after using it every day for over a year, but it hasn't lost even a little of it's non-stick properties (which is essential when you have to wash it).  Even after it being left on the stove for a day it was easier to wash than the spatula!  If I could, I would buy this pan for all of my family and friends- excellent plan 10/10"
"I bought this pan because my old pan went straight into the trash of stuff stuck to it. Follow the instructions about the olive oil, buy the lid with it now because none of your other lids will fit it. Easy to wash, I won't put it in the dishwasher."
"Waited until I had owned this for awhile before I reviewed it because I wanted to see how well it held up. This is a great frying pan; best I've ever owned. I use it every day, often multiple times a day. A breeze to clean, and the non-stick surface is still intact, many months later. Better by far than the ""as seen on TV"" stuff. Will buy again if I ever need to, but it looks like that'll be awhile."
Love them!! In all sizes!! the best pans ever. Will buy More. I have 3 different sizes. Purchased my 1st one last year.. than purchased other brands and they are just nothing to compare to these ones.. that’s why I purchased now 2more and I’m using for couple months now. Same great pans as the 1st one.. will keep buying them.
"My issue with pans is whether or not my husband gives them the thumbs up--he's constantly complaining about uneven heat, not really being nonstick--so far ""Mikey likes it"". He's asked me to buy other sizes. I realize that sooner or later a family member will use a metal fork and scratch it--but at least this isn't so expensive that I'll be too upset."
This pan is just what I wanted in a pan and I love it so much I wish I had a set of these in all sizes. It heats evenly and it will change the way you think of cleaning up! It is so easy to season and keep clean. Very attractive too! I love the weight.
Just ordered these for the second time. I never have anything stick. Used about two times a day for over two years. Not recommended for the dishwasher. My husband put them in anyways and that’s when they started to break down. Hand wash and they’re perfect.
My go to pan. Had it for 9 months and very impressed so far. You HAVE to read and adhere to the instructions.
Absolutely love it! Worth evey single penny. It takes time to heat up. But once hot enough.. acts as good as any non stock frying pan. I bought the other sizes in it too.
"This frying pan is excellent for cooking. It has great weight to it, and evenly balanced. The heat distribution throughout the pan seems to be perfect. There are no hot spots or cool spots.  I really enjoy that it cleans easy and does not contain any chemicals that are harmful to your health. I try and do all my cooking on this pan. I do need to order a smaller one cuz the 12in one is huge."
"I love this pan. It’s the only pan I willingly use now, and my husband as well. It’s enormous, but that’s because I didn’t think through how large 12” actually is. I look forward to intentionally ruining all of my other pans so I can replace them with more of these."
"This is by far the best quality push I've used. So far, absolutely non-stick and easy to clean. I do handwash mine just to be safe."
"If you’re looking for a chemical free, scratch resistant, easy to clean, non sticking and no oil pan use this one! I bought another small one! Love this product! I’m getting these for family this year for Christmas! A necessity after using one time!"
"As of today I have used this pan a dozen times, and I am pleased. Followed the instructions carefully for coating with oil before use. Seems to resist sticking well, and cleans up nice with a sponge. Comes with a protective spacer pad in case you want to store other cookware on top of it. Attractive design makes it look nice hung up or otherwise displayed."
My husband purchased 2 of these for me and I am so pleased with them. They are by far the best non-stick pan I have ever had. The coating is amazing - but you must treat it with care to let it keep doing it's job. They include a felt pan insert so that nothing scratches the surface when you stack other pans on it. Just use rubber spatulas and you're good to go! Only needed to season it with a wipe down of oil before it's first use. LOVE THESE!!
I am not sure what issues other people are experiencing and why but I have yet to use a quote unquote non-stick pan that works as well as this awesome product. I guess I’ll see what happens down the line and write an update seeing as I’ve only had it for two weeks now but I am so impressed so far!  update: still LOVE this pan. has taken over the duties of every other pan i own. so happy with the purchase!
"Was looking for non toxic cookware after watching ‘The Devil We Know‘ documentary on Netflix about the dangers of teflon. Read some blogs that suggested this pan, has been working great so far."
Best pan we have. We kept the felt that came with it so that it doesn’t get scratched. Easy to clean. We generally clean it immediately and hand wash only.
We’ve tried so many pans that lasted a short time. This one is different from the start. It cooks evenly and literally wipes clean. I’ve recently ordered the smaller size too.
"Non-stick, super easy to clean. Cooks foods evenly. So glad I purchased it."
So far it is very easy to clean. Heats food evenly. Have not had it very long so can not speak to the durability of it.
"I loved my first pot like this so much I bought another one when the nonstick started to go.  Yes, the nonstick on my first pot gave out, but I made some mistakes. First, don't use spray oils on these utensils. Turns out they leave a film that you can't remove and that film is definitely the opposite of nonstick. Also, don't use the highest heat. Medium to medium-high works best. That's the healthiest way to cook anyway.  The reasons I bought this pot again, even though it's hard to find in stores now, are its great nonstick properties (if you avoid the mistakes I made with my first one), its large capacity, and its square shape. Before buying this pot, I had to spend a half an hour cleaning up spatter after making or heating pasta sauce. This pot enabled me to cook the spaghetti, drain it and put it in a bowl, then heat the sauce in the same pan with not a bit of spatter (because of the high sides.  It's also perfect for cooking four slices of French Toast or grilling cheese sandwiches.  Treat it well and it will make your life easier!"
"I bought this mostly for frying foods as it has a nice basket and I don't like electric fryers. When I received it, I realized it was so much more. It's extremely nonstick and everything just falls right out of it. The basket feature is great for frying. The lid is sturdy and functional. It can go from range to into the stove no problem as there is no plastic on it. Absolutely LOVE this!"
"My husband & I were looking for several items to purchase: 1. Deep Fry with a Basket 2. Blanching Basket to scald tomatoes, peaches, etc 3. Larger Square Skillet especially for frying Bacon 4. A Roasting Pan  When I saw this pan, it fit the bill for all of the above, so what was going to probably cost us at least $250.00 to purchase all of the above ended up only costing us $49.99. I've used it for frying bacon & it's the perfect size. I've blanched peaches, corn & tomatoes using the ""frying basket"" & I've used it for boiling cobs of corn. We haven't roasted in it yet, but that's just a matter of time & the roasting pan that rests the roast about 3/4"" from the bottom of the pan is exactly what was needed. It is also induction friendly, which is a HUGE bonus, as I like to use my induction cook top when we travel & this pan will meet all my needs. I will be purchasing another."
"For once the tv hype is actually on, remember seeing the advertising as a teenager and was like ya ok dude sure, now as a adult and in a spot where could actually afford to look around at stuff from pricey point to me just being cheap this was in the middle and it was not worth it, all my pots and pans are Gotham steel and stuff really just does not really stick that’s without me using spray or butter. I do recommend washing by hand yes it’s dishwasher safe but when you use dishwasher it more likely to take off the coating of non stick pots and pans."
"love it,,,holds 6.5 quarts. totally nonstick and so easy. heats up very fast too and is great to let food simmer or just stay warm all. day. $35 is a steal for this pan and lid. was $79.95 a few weeks a go."
"I purchased the Gotham Steel - 6 Quart XL Nonstick Copper Deep Square All in One for my daughter because she saw my pan and wanted one like mine. The only difference, one which I wish mine had, is this one has two short handles rather then the one short and one long handle I have. I use mine for chili, cooking pasta, making beef stroganoff, tacos, anything that needs a deep pan. The pan cleans easily, without leaving any residue. I have a number of Gotham Steel frying pans and really like them for their ease in cleaning and cooking. This pan will last a long time!"
"My review is with the use of a glass-top electric stove. This pan is AMAZING. It cooks everything you could desire, evenly and cleans super easily afterwards. It says that no oils are required to prevent sticking, and it is true! I have cooked eggs in it several times and not one piece of egg has stuck to the pan. Everything comes right off, with ease. Just remember- ALWAYS use medium to low heat (I let it heat up a little at a 4 - my stove's medium - and then add the food)."
"This was bigger than the one it replaced, which is great! I can actually get 2 slices of french toast into it and it's not even a tight fit! ( I slice my bread on the diagonal before dipping and frying ). Do be careful, this pan gets HOT and you don't want to have a burnt wrist from the pan edges. My old pan was not as deep as this one, and I nailed myself when using it the first time. That whole muscle trained thing ... LOL"
"We had a very old saute pan that wasn't non stick anymore, so I have been searching for a while for another similar one. I came across this one on accident, but I am actually really glad i did. The price was great compared to some of the other ones out there, and it's pretty big! It also has a non stick surface! It's great, I no longer have to scrape the bottom or worry it burns because this thing is really great!"
"I use a large sauté pan almost every night for making dinner. I have gone through several nonstick pans have been careful to only use plastic utensils with them. They always ended up flaking off which is obviously a concern. So far this Gotham Steel pan hasn’t scratched or flaked at all, and it cleans up really easily. My husband has commented several times on how easy it is to clean. The helper handle also doesn’t get as hot as my last pan, so that’s a plus. Seems to be a quality pan and so far I am very happy with it (been using it for several months now)."
We waited until we had used this pan for a while before writing a review. It is beautiful and totally nonstick. Deep enough for stir fry and just heavy enough to be comfortable when using it. The tempered glass lid fits perfectly and we use it for slow cooking. It is a beautiful copper color and the inside surface seems indestructible. We really love it and recommend it highly!
"This pot is all it is advertised to be. I have never trusted non stick cooking ware because that non stick material always came off the pan and into the food. And food would stick so cleaning wasn’t always easy. Also you couldn’t use metal utensils on it. Metal utensils can be used on this pot. As long as you don’t stab at it with anything sharp, the non stick coating will not be damaged. Cleaning is a real breeze and it is truly non stick. At this time, I could not buy a bunch of pots and pans so I needed one all purpose pan and this pot is it. I’m very pleased."
"I LOVE this pan!! I have several sizes/styles of these Gotham steel pans but this one is my favorite! I love that I can put a whole chicken, pork or roast & veggies in it & put in oven yet I can make a huge batch of food on stovetop! Best of all, it cleans up super easily w/just a scrub brush or sponge, even when something looked like it was sort of burnt at edges & would be horrible to clean! It just wiped right out! I avoid metal utensils & dishwasher. If I could only have ONE pan, it would definitely be this one!!"
"I'm very pleased with this pan. I don't use metal in it, and the surface is still pristine after more than two months. Nothing sticks to it that can't be rinsed off (e.g., the thin edges of the egg white in a fried egg ""stick"", but are easily sprayed off with water, with no scraping). I've done frying with no oil, stir fry with lots of veggies, etc. and it's all worked wonderfully. The lid nicely inverts into the pan for storage without scratching, and the double handle design means more room in the cabinet. I'm looking to buy more pans and get rid of my old Teflons."
"This is exactly what I was looking for. Versatile pan and big enough to cook a whole meal. Do not need oil or butter which is great but can also add a bit just for flavor. Easy to clean, love the grip handle to help keep the pan steady when full and hot. Great for cooktop as well as oven. And it does a good job keeping food warm."
"My husband and I love to fix spaghetti together and this pan is perfect! The deep sides allow plenty of room to brown the meat, add the spaghetti sauce and cooked spaghetti with room to spare. Did I mention it’s easy to clean? It’s so easy you’ll have it clean in a jiffy! Second piece of Gotham Steel cookware and it won’t be our last!"
"I don’t have any complaints about this. I didn’t want an electric one because they’re usually so bulky and I was very happy to find this stove top fryer. I used it for chicken and I loved the results. The oil stays in the pan, doesn’t jump around and once it’s done you can just lift and hook the basket so it can drain. It’s very effective and easy to use. Cleanup was a breeze as well. If this review was helpful in any way, please let amazon know and click on ‘helpful.’ Feel free to ask any questions!"
"I first ordered this product for my daughter in Winter Park, Florida and she is totally in love with this pot. She explained all she can do with the pot and I just had to get one for myself especially when you have company visiting or when my daughter comes from Florida with her 3 kids. It savse a lot of time when you can cook a lot of food at the same time and people don't have to wait. Cleaning is the best part. No struggle in cleaning this pot. Just sponge with soap, towel dry and put away. Gotham Steel is the best product ever invented. Delivery & packaging great. Would highly recommend & would purchase again."
"I needed an extra large deep skillet and when this arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It was the perfect size, not too heavy for me to lift with one arm and nothing sticks to it. My aunt ordered one after seeing it. Great value for the money"
"This is a fantastic pan, especially for frying. Finally found one large enough to allow me to fry enough French fries for the family (instead of having to do 3 batches in regular size. And very well made."
"We are so happy with this we brought two! Such a versatile pot and we especially love the integrated basket.  Also a special shout out to Simon at Real Co, USA (I noticed that several other people sell this so I want to make sure you know the right one to get it to.) When we had an issue with a defective unit, he handled it promptly and completely and we couldn't be happier with his service. Real Co is the real deal so please help support a great vendor like this who totally stands by their product."
"This pan is amazing. I can cook eggs, meat, vegetable or anything else and never have a problem with sticking. It is the perfect size for a family dinner. It is easy to clean since absolutely nothing sticks to it. Wonderful pan!"
Bought for my mom. She's kind of picky on her pots/pans. She was looking for something just like this and it does so much more than expected. She hasn't used the steamer or the basket yet but She said it heats evenly. Doesn't stick. Easy to clean. Good size. The lid fits great. She wants to now buy one for me
"I've used this pan about 12 times since I got it. Although the description says you can't scratch it, I already did. I would recommend only using plastic utensils in this pan. Cutting food inside the pan with steel/ceramic knives have left scratch marks on the inner surface. Doesn't seem to effect the non-stick action, but I was hoping to keep this pan looking new longer. Definitely is non-stick. I NEVER use a spray when cooking with this and haven't had any issues, even with the minor scratches."
I wasn’t expecting much from a $35 pan but thought I’d try it just in case. This pan is the perfect size for family cooking. It has a great non-stick surface and the higher sides make pan frying easier.
"I have a large family and had to use two pans on occasion before we bought this! It cooks evenly! Tested it with pancakes and each one cooked the same amount of time. The bonus is how easy it is to clean, literally minutes to wash it no matter what you cook in it! Highly recommend this, especially if you don’t like cleaning pans!!"
"I was looking for a replacement for my heavy dutch oven, which is hard to clean. This lightweight pan is amazing for making my beef chili. Nothing sticks at the bottom. I made fried chicken and the clean up was super easy. I poured out the cooking oil and gave it a fast wipe with a paper towel. Washed it with soapy water and the liquid just beads off the pan. It's truly nonstick and so much fun to use. Super fast cleanup."
"This is a very nice pan and lightweight. It does not fry well because it never gets too hot. So it is made more for sauces and for sauteeing but not for frying chicken or a hamburger, etc. I returned it because I needed a good frying pan."
Only pots and pans I’ll buy now! They are the absolute best! I have a lot of their other things like their bacon pan! Talk about crispy bacon! Yummy!! Now I’m working on getting their baking accessories!
"My new favorite ! I threw away 2 pyrex dishes for this! It’s versatile, large enough to cook for a family of 5! It steams or roasts vegetables beautifully and my meat is cooked nicely! Very little all is needed and it is seriously non-stick. Quick clean up. Love it!"
Now this is a great pan. I mainly use it to make fried chicken with and it works perfectly. It is so easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great deep pan.
I purchased this pan to replace one of my old school non-stick pans which were falling apart and probably full of chemicals. I really like this pan. It's very easy to use for a variety of dishes and the best part is how easy it is to clean after cooking.
This sauté pan is perfect for big one pot meals.. I even boiled pasta in it. Super easy to clean and so far I’ve had no problem with sticking. I love it
Bought the special for the 9 1/2 inch pan and loved it. Went back and purchased this one to compliment the other. Large size and deep for preparing those large dishes that need to simmer.
"I got this because I needed a larger pan for making family meals. I absolutely love it - large capacity, heats up evenly on my flattop oven and super easy to clean. One or 2 moistened paper towel and it's good to go."
"I like the fact that it's easy to clean,a lot of room that I made Beef Stew in it. My tomato sauce came out great. I don't have any complaints about this pan. I'm Italian love to cook and this pan is great. I love this pan now I have to another one of a different size so thank you."
"We love this pan. It is larger enough to cook a full meal. It is easy to clean, has a great see through lid, and holds all that is needed for dinner for 4-5 people. Great for sautés, stir fry, jambalaya and nearly anything else."
"It is lightweight, versatile, and easy to clean. I can fry a decent quantity at once, although it doesn’t give me the perfectly browned look like cast iron does. The bottom seems to warp a bit as it heats also, however, it isn’t a big deal. It’s a keeper!"
This pan cooks evenly and is so easy to clean. It is a great purchase.
"I love anything Gotham steel. That’s pan is great for on the stove, if you want to deep fry or even baking in the oven. It is nice and deep and a great size. Gotham steel is great because it can go in the dishwasher unlike the competitors. It is the only one like that that I will buy. Never needs oil and it doesn’t need to be baked in the oven with oil. The staff is fantastic."
"I just didn't like it, I LOVE IT. Everone should have a few of these around. I use it to make everything, and waiting to purchase other's from them.... if you love cooking stop and look no further. It made my cooking and cleanups so much easier. Thank's"
"I love this pan! I use this pan all the time. It's large, non stick, goes in the oven & cleans up to just like new. I use it almost daily"
"Clean up is easy.. even with cheese. It doesn't take any effort to clean and I would not recommend the dishwasher for it. My mother has one and by putting it in the dishwasher, made it less effective. I do not use a dishwasher, no need, as I said, it cleans up easy with soap and water and soft cloth."
That is a great versatile pan. Nothing sticks to it- so easy to clean. Others have claimed that it warps…. I suspect those folks are using too high heat for any pan. The heat distribution is so good that you don’t need the temp all the way up! I bought a second one.
I love the.size a d shape.of this pot.....Food.cooks very well The.2 handle.grip is safer when transferring.pot
this pan is huge with great heat distribution and is non stick as advertised very happy with the purchase
Missing the 95 recipes that says included.. and missing instructions. Like what are the clips for?
We have people in our family and we all love cookinf in this pot. I love the height sides to stop splatters and food spilling over the side of a shallower skillet. It is easier to clean initially but we gave our first pot very hard constant use so it would be expected to not be as non-stick as when new. We have several other copper pans and they work pretty well also.
This is versatile.I wish I had the set. NOTHING sticks in this pot and it is large enough for a whole chicken or a simple popcorn on the stove. I love it and wish I had this sooner. Easy to clean as well. 5 stars for this.
"This piece of cookware is sturdy, easy to clean, and very CB I LifeLock. I used it to fry fish and the mesh basket made it easy to remove and drain the fish after frying. Great piece of cookware.. I would recommend it."
I absolutely LOVE this pan its perfect for frying it cleans up so easy. It makes frying foods not messy. Love the pouring spout for emptying used oil. Its also great for baking in the oven although i haven't tried the lid on oven it does say lid is oven safe.
"Love the size of this pan- use it many times a week for everything other than frying- in fact, haven’t fried anything!! Food doesn’t scorch or stick. Super easy to clean."
I had one similar and decided I wanted another one because my son was wearing my old one out and it started chipping... this one was WAY better than my other one. It’s very big and very sturdy! I can definitely feed my family of 6 with this.
Love this pot. Love it so much I bought a second one and bought one as a gift for my son. It is Deep so you don’t have to worry about oil splashing and the square shape allows for a good amount to be cooked at a time.
"This pan is a good weight, heavier but easy to maneuver. Super easy to clean, just wipes out"
"This pot is really good and exactly is as described: easy to use and easy to clean. I use this one replacing three others I am using at same time. For me it’s only a little too big, but it’s great nonstick pot."
I use it for everything
My wife and I were extremely impressed with this pan. We will purchase more from this brand in the future.
Saves me from having a lot of different pans in my cupboard. Takes the place of all those extra pans.
"Was a gift for a friend. She says that was a gift with many uses since cook, fried and steam the food."
Perfect size
"Fastest delivery! Very well made, Can’t rave about it enough. Easy to use & definitely easy to clean. Highly Recommend ✅✅ Do yourself a favor & treat yourself to this Gotham Steel cookware."
My wife loves the whole collection in general but she likes to cook a lot of dishes that you can cook all in one pot. And this pan is big and deep allowing you to easily accomplish all cooking needs
Purchased this 11” deep square Gotham Steel Pan set for my daughter. Her exact words to me were: Thanks Dad. This is exactly what I wanted. It is now my favorite pan!!!
So it didn’t explain how to deep fry if your not supposed to use oil or grease since it’s non stick so I have yet to use my deep fry basket for it however I absolutely love it for once it’s something that holds true and not advertised as a lie
"Great pan, but I guess I miss understood the ad. Said 11 inches deep, I took that as top to bottom, not across"
I bought this pan to go with our set so that we had a larger option when making one-pot meals. This is perfect and is just the right size for what we needed. Super easy to clean due to the copper non-stick surface.
Bought as gift for a beginner cook. They loved it --especially since you don't have to use nonstick spray. Cleans well.
"Large enough to do all my cooking larger than a regular skillet. I also like the frying and steamer options. The non-stick attribute is excellent, cleans in a snap."
Been able to use this pan for almost everything. Every glad I gifted myself.

"I ordered these to replace my worn-out 17 year old frying pans. I have used these new ones ~10-15 times so far and they are absolutely wonderful. Like many other reviewers, the first thing I cooked was eggs— fried and scrambled. They slid off the pan like a fat guy on a soaped-up, downhill slip’n’slide. The only time anything has stuck to this pan was actually when my 10-year-old cooked scrambled eggs. But like I have told her a hundred times before, the reason eggs stick to pans, is because she put COLD eggs on a COLD pan. You have to preheat your pan and you have to let the eggs sit out of the fridge for 10 minutes or so to get the chill off of them.  And I actually have cooked things other than eggs lol. I have pan-seared chicken, sausage, pork chops, sautéed vegetables, and a few other things. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to get a sear on the meat since the pain is so non-stick, but that was not a problem at all.  These pans are excellent. Clean up is a breeze. Five stars, highly recommend!"
"For years I refused to give up the expensive nonstick pans I bought in 1999, even though one had warped and all of them had long ago lost their non-stick finish. I finally got so mad at the mess they made of the food that I set them out at the curb for the garbage men to take away. After reading dozens & dozens of Amazon reviews I finally decided on the Koch Systeme CS nonstick pans in 12"",10"" & 8"" sizes. Woah! What a difference! The food I cook in them practically levitatates out of the pans, even without oil. Cleaning them is so easy, just a quick wipe with a sponge and that's it. I'm treating these pans like they were made of gold & what's funny is they cost a lot less than the ones I finally threw away. I highly recommend these pans, 5 stars plus."
"Nice pan, I’ve never used ceramic until last week and man, these two pans are great. I recommend only hand washing the pan and using rubber utensils when cooking to keep the ceramic safe.  Over the years I have learned that if you wash pan with the dishwasher, that’s really only good for something like stainless steel. Don’t put nonstick pans in the dishwasher, it’s too harsh. Just hand wash and you’ll love these pans. They work great.  My wife and me cooked eggs, steak and bacon on it so far with no problems. Easy to clean. Just let it cool off and wash with water and soap and a soft sponge. I imagine this should last maybe 3-5 years if used right. Not bad for the price."
"I bought this set of pans a few days ago, the quality is awesome and it is really great. It can be stir fry and pan-fried without sticking the bottom. Personlly, I feel that it is not deep enough, but still praised five star."
"We have found these skillets to be of very good quality. After using for a couple of months, we have not experienced any issues. They are a breeze to clean, because nothing seems to stick. It requires very little oil (if any at all) to cook. I read the instruction carefully and I'm always careful never to use the wrong utensils or to overheat. That's really the key to using any non-stick cookware. Only giving 4 stars for durability because that determination can be made over time."
"I have couple frying pan without lid and I'm tired not to have lid. So when I cooked every oil spread everywhere not only stove top but me. My frying pan worn out and it's time to get new ones. I made a decision to get frying pan with lid. This set has 10""and 12"" which are the most popular size. They are pretty light. I have good 12"" stainless frying pan. They are good but super heavy. This one is not which is good for me. Also I like stainless frying pan but it's really hard to cook fried egg. This nonstick frying pan even doesn't need oil. They warm up pretty quick. Once you cook something without oil even you don't need to wash with dish soap. I just use paper towels and wipe it. Easy peasy! Every thing is ordinary but works very well."
"As you can see, the purchased larger size skillet fits in well with the other two smaller ones. I really liked the fact that it matched the color scheme. It cooks very well and is a cinch to clean. You'll enjoy it too! I also like its flexibility in the sense that you can use on the stovetop or place it in the oven...very versatile."
"Everything made in these pans turns out fabulous! Chose them for the non toxic coating & ease of cooking / cleaning. Have used them for several months and A+ performance.  Have used them successfully on both electric glass top & induction stoves. They take a bit longer to heat up, so be patient & include the preheating time in your recipe. Following directions, we keep heat at medium. Absolutely everything from veggies, fried rice, eggs, pancakes, grilled sandwiches, pasta dishes, etc all turn out perfectly.  Cleaning is a SNAP! I use a tiny amount of olive oil when I make something, and all I need to clean is a paper towel and quick wipe. HIGHLY RECOMMEND these pans."
"The original set I received had several small defects in the surface coating. The company responded immediately with a full replacement at no cost to me. I was impressed with their quick response and concern for the quality of their product. Overall, the pans perform as stated in their product writeup. Follow the instructions given and they work as advertised. Don't wash in the dishwasher, clean in the sink. They are very easy to clean by hand. Use a small amount of oil or butter when cooking to prevent sticking, and you will not have any trouble with these pans.Use silicone or wood utensils and the ceramic coating should last a long time."
This is the 3rd time I've used this pan I received for Christmas. I used olive oil and browned my chicken with no residue left in the pan after (see photo). I have an electric range and have no issues with even heating in the pan. Its pretty light weight for the size and the sides and nice and tall so you get fit a lot in there. The clean up is fantastic; you only need soap and water.
I have only used once but they were amazing. They even came with lids. Glad I saw they had the two sizes as a pairing. The 12 inch is large enough for family meals while the 10 inch handles all the smaller portions or the side dish. Very easy to clean. Don't love the color wish they were blue but overall very happy with the purchase.
"Love these pans, easy to use and most importantly to clean. The only thing I can complain about is the handles are really long. The glass cover also leave a lot to be desired, we have to keep tightening the handle and the metal edge of the inner glass looks like it's starting to rust. Please don't let the lids detract from the pans - these are easy to use and clean up and the heat dispersal is excellent."
"I've had to change the way I flip and stir while cooking to prevent the food from sliding out. More than non-stick, I'd say the surface is slippery. The pans are quite light weight and seem to be well designed and constructed. The value for the money, though, depends on how long they last so a review after one month can only say that I see no signs of wear yet."
"I'm so glad that we decided on this pan set. After our old pan had lost its ""nonstick"" quality we knew that we needed to find an updated pan or two. This set is perfect - the food comes off effortlessly with little effort during cleaning, and the two sizes are great so that we can make a variety of dishes. The lids also perfectly fit keeping in the heat, as needed. This set was a great deal, and I would definitely recommend this pan set to anyone looking for nonstick pans!"
"I've been using these pans for about 6 weeks now and really like them. I recently ordered an 8"" pan to complete my set. They clean up very easily. I just use the sponge side of my scrubby pad. The handles are long and have not heated up much as I cook. I would definitely recommend these."
"These pans with matching lids are fabulous...they spread the heat evenly. I let them cool and them use cool water on them and they continue to look like brandnew. Food tastes great. They clean like a dream. Love them!! PS I bought ""repackaged"" and they so no signs of distress so I scored a good percentage off the already reasonable price."
"Works with induction, and you basically rub the inside with a cleaning brush (soft), wipe them out with a paper towel, and you're done. It's a pan. Will it survive a decade? I don't know, but it wasn't $300 per pan, like my mom's, so I'm not that worried about it."
"I love these pans!! They heat up immediately and evenly, and are SO easy to clean. I love that the pancakes or omelets never stick, and that I can do the TV-chef flip 😄 of them!!"
"Have had these pans for 2 years now and definitely the best quality and durability I have ever had in a pan. The non-stick lining is still holding up. Before using, wash and coat with a light coating of olive oil, then heat on low to season the pan."
"Nicely balanced, pans sit flat on stove without having to prop up handle as in some other “quality” pans. These pans actually will brown meats unlike some other, supposed quality, nonstick pans Cleaned up with a paper towel and showed no scuds or scratches from cooking utensils. Handle stayed at a useable, handleable temperature throughout cooking. And they look great !"
These frying pans are great. Love the way they cook and clean up. Had a problem with one of the lids and customer service was great. They immediately responded and resolved the problem.
Awesome price and value for the set. These are definitely non stick!! I have bought other pans and they stick. These are Super easy to use and cook on! Very easy to clean. Perfect size! Very durable and sturdy. Love these pans! Definitely recommend!!
Great pans BUT... be sure to heat the pan and then add olive oil. Otherwise it ruins the non-stick surface.
I've needed a bigger pan for a looooong time (several years) but kept putting it off because I get overwhelmed trying to figure out a good one. LOVE these. Not even over easy eggs stuck to them!
"After using teflon pans for years and throwing them away when they got scratched and started peeling, these durable and super easy to clean pans have won me over! Even heating during cooking and simplest clean up ever make these pans worth the price. The fry pans convinced me to come back and order small pots too. Five stars"
"Love that they came with lids on each pan. Super easy to clean, most of the time you just wipe any residue off with paper towel so washing is a breeze. I would recommend."
I've never reviewed anything outside of books. These pans are amazing. Only had them for a week and am delighted. No more scraping the egg off of a previous pan. Eggs slide right out and the pan hardly needs to be washed. Highly recommended.
These pans are heavier than the pans replaced and seems to spread the heat threw out the pan. Foods cook evenly in pan and the lid is of good design. These are well worth the price.
Ease of cleaning is a real asset. I dislike the very long handles and would prefer smaller handles on either side of the pan. Nothing has ever burned in these and they still look like new after four months of daily usage.
"I love these so far! Would be 5 stars all around but the knob on the top of lid is a bit close to the glass which gets a little warm but other than that I love them. Lightweight, evenly heated cooking, and no sticking issues what so ever! Update 06/15/2020........Upgraded to 5 stars! Now that I've gotten a bit more used to the the know on the glass lid, I love these!!!!"
I love these pans! Thank you for a great product! I have used them at least 20 times and I've never had any non stick pans perform so well! I often cook without any oil and my food just slides right out! They are super easy to clean and still look like new. Lids are a lifesaver. I expect to be purchasing others in the future! Thank You!!!
These skillets are awesome and food does not stick. The cleanup is so fast and I find it cooks the food evenly. I use these skillets just about every day.
"The pans are substantive, good looking & with lids. Previous pans either domed up or down due to lack of substance. Food slides off well. Oil stays in one place - flat!!! Only time will tell - will come back next year and update this."
"LOVE these pans! They are lightweight and cook beautifully. The larger one is larger than I thought I needed, but it proved me wrong. The nonstick is exactly what I'd hoped for. My oven has been broken for four months and these pans have been used multiple times a day now for many months. Highly recommend."
Purchased these on recommendation of a friend. Needed some new fry pans for our travel trailer--OMG these are awesome & clean so easy. Had to order the large one for my husband to use in the home cuz he was so impressed.
"Not being a very good cook, these pans are perfect. I can cook just about everything in them. They are super easy to clean and the great part is nothing sticks to them. Super easy to clean, rish and wipe then let dry. And the price is really budget friendly."
These are replacing old skillets and I’m very happy with these.
I like the sturdy handles and the easy non stick surface. When hung for storage they fit nicely into each other making room for other cooking vessels.
I cooked chicken Italian sausage burgers in them the first time and it worked out beautifully. The cleanup was practically nil.
"I am amazed at these pans, they are aewsome. You have to be careful mixing or flipping food, it will slide right out of pan."
I have had these for a few months now and I wonder why I didn't buy them sooner. Great non-stick pan with a good quality feel to them.
First time I used ceramic skillet. Usually use teflon. This is way better. Stuff really does just slides right off. Small problem is trying to grab something. It slides out of your way sometimes.
After a year of frequent use these pans are as good as new. I love them!
Used it first time last night and loved it wiped out clean then washed in sink hopefully they last a long time. Sturdy. Very pleased
It is indeed non-stick. Very easy to clean & heat is distributed evenly across the surface of the pan. Very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommend this product.
The pans are beautiful to look at with the copper inside and black outside. Food slides out and they clean up easily. I've only been using them for a week so can't attest to durability. I'll update as I use them longer.
"this has, by far, been the best pan I have ever used!! so easy to clean!! NOTHING sticks to it!! I have used many other pans over the years and there always seemed to have something stuck that needed to be scrubbed out. NOT these pans. They are truly amazing!!!"
I love how easy these pans are to cook and clean. Any time I buy pans I wonder if they’ll be good like they say and so far these have been.
"This pan, is the pan that I have been waiting my entire life for!! Seers hard, like a cast iron, Cleans with just a wipe, Absolutely Amazing!!!"
"We are finally in our apartment and can now use our wonderful skillets. Nothing has stuck, even melted cheese. I still use a dab of butter when I cook our eggs because we enjoy the flavor the butter adds. I am so glad I chose this product and I would choose it again. These skillets clean like nothing I have had before."
Great lightweight pans! The nonstick surface is wonderful— food just slides right off. Will purchase again when the time comes.
"I've been through so many non stick pans over the years. These are perfect. No tephlon. My husband can stab them with forks and they don't nick, peel or get damaged. Also like how food cooks in them. Super easy to clean, even something like burnt cheese."
"These heat well on my induction stove. They are very light. They clean like magic,. I use the 8 inch version for eggs and it cleans up like a charm."
Love these pans! Definite recommend!
Best surface I have used so far. Easy to clean even if you burn something like peppers and onions.
Only use twice so far but acts as good as ant no-stick pan I had.
So far these pans are great absolutely do not stick and clean up with soft cloth and soapy water. If they last then well worth the $60 cost.
"; They are fry pans , what might you think I might add??"
Food doesn't stick and it's easy to clean
"I love these pans. Nothing sticks and they simply rinse clean. They are the best cookware, of ANY kind, I have ever used."
We love them. Use daily. Wish the handles were a little shorter though. But overall. Great product
They were good for 2 months but all went to trash wasn't non stick anymore
"I was worried that they wouldn’t be deep enough, but they are! I can fry up pot stickers and plenty of other recipes. They are lighter than my old skillets and a good value. Clean up is easy - wet paper towel does it. I recommend them!"
The smaller pan arrived warped so bad that the lid won't fit.very frustrating considering the cost.  Quickly sent out replacement pans. Love these pans. Happy for quick service fixing priblem
I have been using these for a couple of months and they are amazing. Easy to cook in an easy to clean! Still look like new months later. They have made cooking easier... so worth it!
These pans are awesome! Food will not stick and are super easy to clean up! They still look brand new after several months of use. Would highly recommend them.
Absolutely love these pans. I would buy them again and probably will for Christmas presents !
I love the nonstick surface that is truly nonstick.
i really appreciate the ease of cooking & cleaning with these pans. Plus the lids fit so well. I’m so happy.
"I have used All Clad for many years. This is my first All-Clad nonstick set with glass lids (Essentials Nonstick Saucepan set, 4-Piece, Grey), purchased on Amazon. I bought these about three months ago to replace an older set of nonstick pots (Macy's brand) also with glass lids that I've used for almost 15 years. I've only used my brand new All Clad nonstick pots maybe a handful (8 to 10) times, usually for reheating soups and sauces. They are not used daily and I do take good care of them when I have used them.  So today, I was reheating soup uncovered in the 4.5 qt pot on my gas stove, then turned off the heat and covered the pot with its glass lid. About three minutes later, my daughter was in the kitchen next to the stove and heard a loud ""pop."" She found that the lid had shattered, and luckily for us, the glass did not burst. Still, I threw away the soup because I couldn't be sure that micro glass fragments did not end up in the soup.  I ended up calling All Clad customer service on the phone because it was such a shocking experience to have something like this happen. I wanted report the potential danger/harm of using their product, instead to my surprise, what I found out was that All Clad doesn't stand behind the safety and durability of all of their products -- they informed me that their ""limited"" manufacture's warranty against defects does NOT cover lids. I was told that I would't be able to purchase a replacement even if I wanted to, but they do sell universal lids and I should buy that if I wanted a cover for my pot. WTH? Major disappointment."
"A product this expensive will never be a 5 star value. It is high quality  Update: Taking away a star. The pot is downright dangerous. The handles get so hot you can't touch them at all. The colander leaks enough where the pot and colander meet to make it useless. While boiling potatoes we had to ditch the colander in the middle of cooking it was making such a mess.  Don't bother. If you can afford All-Clad you can afford better. The pans are fine and cook well although we still have to spray them when cooking eggs, pancakes or other sticky foods."
"This product is great for the value. Unfortunately, we have had scratches on our pans with only two months of use. We’ve been extremely carefully with them by only using wooden and plastic spoons when we cook and silicone sponges to clean them, yet somehow they still managed to get scratched and a dent on one of the pans. The description claims they are scratch-free and that’s what we expect for the price we paid for these pans."
"You have no idea how long I researched this purchase. I knew I was going to spend some money and wanted the best bang for my buck. Honestly, I am not regretting these pots or pans at all.  They are non-stick and I literally watch food rinse right off or eggs just flip with ease and they haven’t warped at all. The one annoying thing is one of the pans doesn’t have a lid but in the entire realm of things it doesn’t make me deduct a star.  Yes they are pricey but they are an investment. I absolutely love these pans and feel like all my searching ended up with a phenomenal product."
"Some of the best cookware on the market...Ive used them for years. The newest version has redesigned the handle to be easier for weaker people to use, the older handle was awkward long, uncomfortable to the casial user, but it was designed for function. The new handle filled the open cavity of the old handle removing harsh edges with a smooth hand hold."
"Our first set of All-Clad was 25 years ago. This is our second set and would never consider anything else then All-Clad. We've had many friends ask how we keep our older pans new looking, and the answer is quite simple - take care of them! Don't use metal utensils, don't use abrasive sponges, don't put them in a dishwasher. They are SUPER easy to keep clean with simple hand washing with a non-abrasive sponge.  Putting any non-stick or anodized aluminum cookware in a dishwasher is NOT recommended. Many stronger detergents such as POD types detergents can weaken or even strip the anodizing away. It's not the cookware, it's the detergents. Would you use an abrasive sponge to wash your car? Of course not! The same applies to non-stick pans. It's a coating. If you scratch the coating, it will no longer be non-stick.  We look forward to another 25 yrs."
"We were long overdue for an upgrade on Cookware. We cook at home every day, so our previous set was pretty beat up after 5-6 years, it wasn't the best quality to begin with. We decided to splurge and get a really good set and ended up deciding on this one. WOW! Food cooks more evenly, with less oil, and we can throw stuff in the broiler for a minute or two at the end to add a bit of crispiness before serving. Our omelet and stir fry game just got a lot better. And cleaning is much easier. Nothing sticks to these things. 10/10 would recommend. I just hope quality doesn't degrade over time"
"They are beautiful and so easy to clean. I've been following advice from previous reviews and NOT putting them in the dishwasher. It's only been a month but they are as perfect as the day they came out of the box. (and I cook every day). I've recently moved and am trying to re-learn cooking on an electric stove (which I hate) and I've burned a few things and had to start over. I just wiped a paper towel across the pan and it was ready to go again right away. It just wipes out. I'm hoping that if I treat them well (handwashing and not scratching them) that they won't chip and peel like every other ""non stick"" pan, they will last a long time. So far I love them."
"ITS NOT INDUCTION ready yet ALL CLAd’s description said it was usable on all cooktops. Why did you answer in your question and answer section that it definitely indication ready. If you are going to allow random people “like Bob” answer questions about your product, Allclad, you might monitor the answers. If it were my product I wouldn’t let anyone say anything except a company verified person who is knowledgeable of the product.  A complete waste of my time"
"I cannot say enough how much I love these pans. Top quality all the way. I love that they have handles on each side of the pan. They clean up so easy! My son has a competitor's set of pans and after using my All Clad, he said this will be his next set. I highly recommend this product. It's worth every penny!"
Had these a few weeks and absolutely love them! I actually enjoy cooking now. Nothing sticks!!! And cleanup is sooo easy. Food just slides out of the pan! Be sure and season them before use.
"Googled and researched BEST cookware for 2020 and after lists and lists and reviews on Amazon and all over the internet came to these. Hubby loves them for his Christmas gift, he's the cook. The handles refuse to get hot on the stove top because of the design. Very sturdy too"
"What can I say besides Awesome!? Heavy duty, heat fast, hold heat, even cooking throughout…basically just wipe clean/soapy water. I don’t put mine in dishwasher by choice."
Nice set but rather light weight and thin walled compared to the older professional models we have had for a number of years.
"This was a perfect Christmas gift for my Son, that moved into his new condo. Easy to clean, food doesn’t stick and cooks food evenly. Definitely adding more to my Son’s collection."
"They retain heat super well; clean easily, and so far after few uses have held up on the non-stick with proper use."
"My wife complained at first use, but she didn’t follow the preparation instructions. After that, they work great. No sticking"
"It's All Clad! if it's good enough for my old boss Thomas Keller, then it's good enough for me!!! very easy clean up. More expensive than most, but well worth it. Very durable. But i still put towels between them just because."
"We are very happy with the performance of this set, although we are concerned about durability. We take good care of the set: hand wash only using non-abrasive sponges and gentle dish soap, avoid overheating, and use only wood or nylon utensils. Yet, our frying pan is starting to slowly show scratches. Nothing of concern yet, but we can tell these are not made like the All-Clad sets of yore. That being said, these turn out great food. Just be prepared to replace them sooner than you would with a sturdier set."
Great love cooking in is fun to use Even heating
"Great, Heavy, and Durable!! I cannot say enough great things about my All-Clad pots and pans."
Absolutely love these will be getting more
So far so good. Have withstood many uses and cleanings.
"Purchased these to replace some ten year old Caphalon pots and pans. These are finished beautifully, easy to clean and have a well balanced heat dissipation."
I use it to cook all my meal. I am planning to buy a smaller frying pan
It doesn't burn food and is easy to clean.
"Very sturdy material, but not heavy or hard to lift. I followed the seasoning instructions before initial use, and we have had zero issues with food sticking to the pans. Very user friendly, food cooks evenly, minimal cleanup and great value for the price. This was definitely worth the investment!"
About this set for my wife's birthday and she loves it! I found it to be a bit pricey but quality seems to be there. See how it holds up over time.
We have the full set of the D5 stainless ALL Clad and prefer these over the stainless. Very well made with proper heat distribution. Durable and dishwasher safe. We are very pleased with them.
"For the money I would’ve preferred an 8”stockpot instead of a 7” but, I love the look the feel and I love the easy clean up. I also wished the square pan had a cover"
"Love love this cookware. I bought an 11 piece set on sale at a Home Goods and found I wanted a larger saucepan. I ordered online and paid half of what I did for the larger set. BUT, I’m very happy! They’re worth it!"
"So far, these kitchen essentials are living up to their billing. Excellent non-stick surface, but we will see about long-term. Very easy to clean."
I love my All Clad products. The non-stick surfaces are wonderful! Can't believe that I waited so long to upgrade my pots and pans!!
Purchased as a great ft for our DIL. She loves them!
Best pots and pans set ever! I received these for Christmas and I honestly don’t want to buy any other brand now!
Bought these for my wife who loves to cook. She loves how beautifully the food cooks and does not stick to the surface. Looking forward to preparing many delicious meals. And they clean so easily with soap and water.
"Nice size pots and it just makes cooking easy. Absolutely no sticking and no cracks, just gorgeous pots!"
Love thesepots From the glass lid to the cool handles! Perfect sizes for everyday cooking. Easy to clean
Bought the set July 2021 and the coating is already chipping away on each pot and pan . Super disappointed since I heard this Brad was top of the line. My return timeframe ended and I am now searching for a new set.
Love these pans. Except for the lid handles are metal and get hot need pot holder
What’s there to say?? It’s AllClad!!
"These are the best pans, the price is great and they are worth every cent"
my favorite set of pots and pans easy to clean love them!
"I believe that All Clad is the gold standard in cookware. Their products are first rate quality and will be used by generations, once purchased."
"I have been using All Clad cookware for over 40 years, it was not what I expected from this manufacturer, the teflon coating is so low grade I was almost offended. In the past I never purchased high priced kitchen utensils or cookware online, so l learned: for me buying is seeing and feeling what l'm paying for. Thank you."
"I don't know why I waited so long to change out my left over pots and pans from college. I'm so glad I finally decided to ""adult"" and invest in some great cookware. This pots and pans are stylish, durable, high quality, easy to clean. I couldn't be happier!"
"Great quality pots, highly recommended"
"Great cookware, durable and easy to clean."
These are two pots that are very useful sizes that have a comfortable weight and balance. Cleaning is a breeze.
"My husband surprised me with this set for Christmas and I could not love it more. They are nice and heavy, very well made. But the best part for me is that they are dishwasher safe. This was my first set from All-Clad and I will definitely purchase more."
Love it. Bought all new pans and they make cooking fun. Feels fresh and new.
These products are absolutely first rate.
Absolutely beautiful!!! Been wanting this set for the longest time and was finally able to invest. It’s worth every dollar!!
Perfect pots
"I already own All-Clad , but not nonstick. I am in love with these pans ! Great value , easy cleanup, less oil . I cook pancakes with no oil or lard, they don’t stick and brown evenly."
"Easy to clean. Make sure to read directions before use, very helpful. Love how they stack. Versatile lid so you don’t have an abundance"
pans are well made and slightly bigger than other company products
THE BEST! Worth every penny! Nothing sticks to these and they cook so evenly! Clean up is so quick and easy too. I waited a few months to write a review because I wanted to be sure we liked them. Had them about 3 months and use them daily. LOVE THESE!
Best pots and pan with protective coating i have owned. Worth the money.
"Heavy duty, easy to clean, nothing sticks!"
Perfect addition to my collection.
This set is fantastic. Worth the money!
Quality
Long time All-Clad customer
"If you are on the fence, just buy these! They are beautiful and shine almost like tiny non stick diamonds! These are stunning and are by far the best cookware I have ever owned!"
Heavy solid nonstick cookware. These pans clean up beautifully either by hand or in the dishwasher.
"I am so pleased with pots ease of use, heat distribution and easy clean up"
"High quality, reasonable price..."
Love this set! We use these daily at our house. So easy to clean. I loved them so much I bought my mom a set for Mother’s Day.
Seem to hold up better than other pan sets we have owned.
"The only reason I'm having to buy these pans, is because of my son-in-law. He has ruined my other pans by NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. These are the rules with any non-stick pan that you want to KEEP non-stick. 1) No high heat! These pans work exceedingly well at low and medium. Even pre-heating these pans on high will warp the metal and damage the non-stick coating. 2)HAND WASH ONLY! Automatic dishwasher detergents have caustic agents in them that will damage certain metals and will ruin non-stick coatings. 3) NO SPRAYS! Things like Pam have a propellent in them that will also damage the non-stick coating. 4) NO COLD WATER ON A HOT PAN! Who does that? I've seen him take a sizzling hot pan and run cold water right out of the faucet on it. Really? I'm sure that he does that to get the grease out, while the pan is still hot. But, doing so will warp the metal and ruin the non-stick coating. 5) NO METAL UTENSILS! Again, who does that? I've seen metal spoons, ladles, forks, spatulas and even KNIVES used on my pans. Don't do that. Just.....DON'T.  Calphalon brand pans are some of the best on the market and will last YEARS if they are treated with care and respect. I have a full set of Calphalon pots and pans. I am very pleased with them and have full confidence that everything I cook in them is going to turn out great. Good purchase. Five stars."
Just received and larger pan defective. The handle was positioned to where end sits lower than pan bottom ( so that pan CANNOT lay flat on stovetop). Am returning set.
"First, many of the reviews of this pan seem to be for a set or other products. I would prefer reviews that are SPECIFIC to the item listed for sale.  I have used and loved Calphalon for over 20 years. I should have known that the price point of this pan was too low for a high quality Calphalon pan. I don't know if this is a lower quality line or the pan is defective or what. This pan does not heat evenly. Cooking bacon gives me one half burned and one half barely cooked. I must babysit everything I cook constantly and move the food around in the pan to keep it from burning. Clean up is easy so that is nice. That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. I NEVER put any cookware in the dishwasher so I can't speak to how it holds up there. I am very disappointed with this pan. it has damaged my confidence in Calphalon and my trust in that brand."
"ok, this skillet looks wonderful, if you're going to go with hard anodized skillets. However, I have been totally unable to even use mine! I've washed it by hand in warm, soapy water 4 <FOUR!> times already, once even with a nylon scrubbie sponge, and still, I'm getting black stuff on the towel I dry the pan with. I can only assume this black stuff is going to leech into the food I cook in this pan so, as of right now, I've not used it. Is there anyone else who has experienced the same?? I would like the manufacturer to help me out here. Just what is this black stuff??? I've attached a photo of what is coming off the pan on a dish towel. It reflects what I see on the towel when I rub the pan dry with my three fingers. UPDATE: I contacted Calphalon directly and I must say they were more than helpful and did send me a replacement pan. Unfortunately, my review must remain the same, as I experienced the exact same problem with the new pan. That's enough for me. I don't have time/energy to deal with this further, so I am out not only the pan, which I really needed, but I'm out the original cost as well. Does anyone know if these pans would be recyclable? not sure how to dispose of the one I have. And one more thing... the ""black stuff"" remains unidentified. Calphalon was unable to identify it either and said it was perhaps something from my dishwasher, but I've never put this pan in the dishwasher, ever. <shrugs>"
"I needed some non-stick pans. I have been using all-clad D5 stainless steel for the past 6-7 months of cooking. While they're good, some times you just need a non-stick pan to keep your sanity. (Especially since the D5 series heats and retains that heat... lots of scorched foods as I navigate the learning curve) I did some research on amazon before buying these two pans. I considered getting a whole flight of pots and pans but thought do I really need all that cluttering my cabinets? NO. 2 pans is all you need when you've already got pots for boiling or simmering. These two pans get the job done and are a cinch to clean! I used the small pan to sear some burgers, then finished in the oven. Despite them being greasy, the pans wiped clean with a paper towel. Ohhhh what a relief that is! The only cautionary tale I have is that the small pan's handle is quite small for my hulk hands. When heating, take caution as the handle can get quite hot toward the base of the pan. Nothing a potholder or oven mitt can't solve though."
"I had bought one for myself that I liked very well, I bought another for myself and bought 2 as gifts . I only used silicone spatula, wood spoons , absolutely no metal was ever used. I have had this 7 months but I would think it should last longer. And also I hand wash it . Jean"
Dont buy this thing. Metal is too thin and warped after JUST A SINGLE USE!!! I left the pan on the stove for over 20 minutes with the burner turned off so the pan could cool down before washing. Didnt make a difference. Cheap crap.
"[Edit 6/6/21] it’s been almost exactly two years since I bought this Dutch oven so I thought I’d post an update. I’m very pleased at how evenly the heat is distributed, how easy it is to clean - especially the lid - the size, appearance and durability. I’m no chef but I do cook quite a bit and this workhouse performs effortlessly day after day. I’m very glad I bought it. [/Edit]  I started steaming seitan and so needed to up my Dutch oven game. After quite a bit if searching I found this and I’m really very glad.  When I opened the box there must have been some sort of optical illusion because it looked so small! When I took it out and compared it to my old Dutch oven it morphed into its real size. No, I wasn’t smoking anything lol. It’s a nice size and the large diameter helps when steaming.  This DO is pretty much exactly what I was looking for. The right size, weight and a nice look. Oh, and easy to clean. Couldn’t ask for more."
"So I wanted to make cooking and easier experience for me and opted for this pan. The nonstick coating really shows it's worth when you let the pan get hot. Key part of it being: LET THE PAN GET HOT. Leave it on whatever temp you want/need but actually allow time to pass before you cook. When you come back after a couple minutes (time I used to chop or prep whatever I'm cooking) and start putting food in to cook, you get a nice sear on your food that almost makes it taste charred.  In terms of cooking, I have sauteed, fried, and boiled pasta in this pot and it's been fantastic. The pasta was an experiment that has become a great tip I've adopted. I'll boil water, add pasta, strain and set the cooked pasta aside, wipe out the pan and cook the rest of the meal before tossing the pasta back in."
"I love this brand so much. You get exactly what you pay for with Calphalon products. I wanted a wok, but settled for this and I don’t regret it one bit. The inside is super easy to clean, but I will mention that the outside of the pan is not as easy to clean if something gets stuck and or burnt onto it. This is perfect for cooking bigger meals in, and I use it at least once a day. I will never go back to another brand of pots and pans."
"The Calphalon frying pans were ordered to replace 2 pans that are beyond their usefulness.  We LOVE Calphalon products. They are made of sturdy metal, have a long-lasting nonstick surface, and provide even heat distribution. These pans are a non-issue in our household. My wife, who uses them the most, told me the old ones were worn out and to order 2 new Calphalon pans. She was very specific that no other brand was to be ordered,...Calphalon only !! We both like the way the handles pans are made since they are oven safe up to 450 degrees. Just make sure one uses a potholder when taking the pan out of the oven.  BOTTOM LINE: We have used Calphalon pans for many years, and truly like the quality of their products. We will definitely order again."
"I was looking for a larger saute pan than the one I had so I ordered this one. Apparently I didn't realize just how big a 5 quart saute pan is. This sucker is HUGE! It's also heavy so you'll develop some good arm muscles if you use it frequently. All kidding aside, this is a well made, durable, easy to clean pan with all of the quality Calphalon is known for and you'll be grateful for it's hefty size at your next dinner party of family gathering."
"This is my favorite pot we’ve ever had. As with any nonstick cookware, I only use a wooden or silicon spoon when cooking in this to avoid scratching. I’ve also been hand-washing it. (I never put pots/pans in my dishwasher.) I have a gas stove, and it has cooked anything I’ve made evenly. It’s also incredibly easy to scrub clean after using. I used to dread cooking due to cleaning the dishes afterward, but this scrubs clean instantly no matter what I have cooked in it. I wish I’d bought the set sooner because this line is so pleasant to use I smile in appreciation every time I cook with them. I highly recommend!"
"I don't always review purchases on Amazon, but when I do, the product deserves it. If I get a lousy product I'll let people know... That's how this works, we rely on reviews because we can't hold it in our hands. With that being said, this is the second purchase of this exact pan that I've made. Made. First of all, it's extremely sturdy, which is hard to find with cheap cookware. Cookware. I would say this is anything but cheap, it's moderately priced but it's well built. That fits directly on top And is simply awesome for cooking. so here's the downside, you are buying a Teflon pan and no matter how careful you are over time, it's going to get a little beat up and a little more until all of a sudden it's not really non-stick anymore. Notice above I said this is my second purchase... I got a lot of mileage out of my first one and I was happy with it. It says it's dishwasher safe and I'm sure it is but honestly, you're better off hand washing this. It takes up less space in the dishwasher and you won't ruin it. Take good care of it and the last of very long time. This was a good purchase on Amazon, one of the few"
"With a name like the every day pan you may look at it and think I won’t use it every day… But let me tell you once you’ve used this pan, you might find that you actually do use it every day! It is absolutely my favorite pan and I cook a lot. I’m the primary cook in my household I have made everything in this pan from stirfries to meatballs to chicken to macaroni and cheese… I can’t think of anything I wouldn’t cook in this pan it is super easy to clean has plenty of room to cook for plenty of people I have for in my household. I’d love it I would replace all my other pans with this pan if it wasn’t as expensive as it is. And when I say that I mean I would literally buy like four of these pans or five to have a back up. Best Pam I’ve ever used! Sturdy awesome hear distribution The angles make it easy to use a spatula there’s no hard area to pick food up with because the angles allow you to slide under your food easily. 10 out of 10!"
"At first I was bummed because it was hand-wash only (I didn't pay attention to the description) but I got over it pretty quickly. Hand washing it after use isn't really an issue, although I do run it thru the dishwasher every now and then if I'm feeling lazy. Hasn't turned into a pumpkin yet. Pan is great, not warped or peeling or anything. The lid hasn't shattered and the world hasn't ended. Yes the handles get hot over a gas flame (duh). I use this pan for everything from long slow simmers, to making a big batch of scrambled eggs, to sauteing fish fillets. It's the perfect size!"
I was in dire need of a new fry pan. My old one had lost all of its charm. Everything stuck to it. It was always a big mess even using oil or Pam didn’t help. So I decided to get a new one. There are so many out there that make all kinds of claims. It caused great confusion for me. That day I happened to be doing some baking and when I took out my baking pans I realized I had the answer in my hands. Several years ago my husband bought me a set of calphalon bakeware for Christmas. As I took out these pans I realized they were in perfect shape like the day I got them. So I ordered the calphalon fry pan with lid and I know that it was a wise purchase. I use it everyday. Sometimes three times a day. It’s sturdy. Nice to look at and I feel confident it will last a long time just like my bakewear
"I really liked the quality, and especially the 10"" size. My existing and new 8"" are perfect for some things but needed one slightly larger (and smaller than the 12"" pan I have) and this is it. And I will not buy any that will not tolerate a higher oven heat as I use in oven also almost as often as on top of stove. I like the balance and feel of the handle too. Perfect for my cooking for two."
"This is a great addition to my kitchen at a great price. It's a solid, heavy piece that's well made. I e been used it for a few months and it shows no wear at all. I love the size of this as well. It's a little deeper than most sauté pans but not as deep as a Wok. I love Calphalon."
I finally upgraded my kitchen pots and pans with a Calphalon set. I loved the set so much I wanted to buy a couple of extra frying pans. These pans are great. Very sturdy. Oven safe. The only thing to note: they are handwash only. If you are a fan of just throwing pans in the dishwasher – you’re out of luck.
"Welp most importantly it works. This is a chef's pan not a ""wok"" as some reviews here claim. So yes it's got a bit more rounded sides but that's better for a multipurpose pan like this one. Also the Teflon coating is the best I've ever had so far. This thing seriously works well. Did not realize the difference until now between a crap pan and a good one. An added plus is that there is no coating on the handle rivets inside the pan which usually tend to chip off and end up in the food."
"I ordered these pans because I've used my son's set. They are extremely durable. They distribute heat well on glass-top and gas stoves. They clean amazingly easily with NO scouring. Just wipe clean. We store them with a small towel or folded paper towel in between just to be cautious. I really don't know if it's necessary, but it seems like a good idea."
"When I say I love this pan I really LOVE this pan. I purchased this item right before Thanksgiving. With Prime, it arrived on time. It lives up to its description ~ all purpose. I used it to sauté, to sear and to simmer! I also used it to roast!! It cooks evenly and it handles well for its size. Clean up is a breeze. I can prepare foods at a lower temp and I can cook for a large group. This pan singlehandedly kicked my cooking game up a few notches!!!"
"Upon receiving the pan, I thpught this pan was a bit flimsy due to its light weight. After I have used it numerous times cooking, I grow to love it more and more. It provides even browning (due to its flat base design). The only slight negative is the all-metal handles. It is a bit inconvenient to keep remembering to use a cloth pot handle cover every time I move or rotate the pan during cooking. Still, the food turns out perfectly cooked. This pan is a must-have in the kitchen."
"Bought these pans back in July 2017. They are both excellent, release sautéed food effortlessly, and have not warped. Have not tried cooking without oil or margarine. We use the smaller pan daily to make omelettes out of cage-free, pasteurized egg whites with melted Smart Balance margarine, using medium heat on a ceramic cooktop. We wash the pan after it cools off, with warm water and mild dish soap. We use the larger pan once in awhile and it's been great, like for pancakes. After they're cleaned and dry, we stack them with clean cloth dishtowels in between so that they won't scratch. I've decided to give away our old IKEA non-stick pans and buy an additional set of the Calphalon, because the difference in quality is so palpable."
I am very found of Calphalon cookware. I have several pots and pans. But this Dutch oven doesn’t seem heavy duty like my other pieces. There’s not much weight to it. Seems like it’s made of cheap steel. Not what I expected for Calphalon. Love the size so I’ll keep it. Hopefully it’ll last like my other stuff.
"These pans are great! My last non-stick pan purchase was from Pampered chef, and they only lasted a year. I was pretty disappointed in those, so I wanted to find something more durable, and ACTUALLY nonstick! Not to mention less expensive! .my hubby and I found these and we love them! You really don't need any oil in them at all, and they wash so incredibly easily. Also, I was quite pleased with how the handles only get warm, and not hot to the touch. We've been using these almost daily for over a month, and very pleased! Also my husband is happy with how easy he can flip an egg in the smaller one."
"I used these pans for year cooking at my grandmothers house so I decided to buy them for myself, I love these pans. They are easy to clean, heat evenly . I have used these pans on both electric and gas stove tops and they cook great on both surfaces. I make sure I following the cleaning instruction, hand wash after cooling but I dry them right after so the water doesn't sit on the pans but you don't have to do that. My only issue with the purchase was my 10in had come with scratching on the outside of the pan due to poor handling during shipment. I keep it anyways because it a hassle for me to mail it back due to my location and the cooking surface part was good condition. Another plus was these fry pans are made in the USA!  I would recommend these they will last a long time if they are cared for correctly."
"Love this pan, just fried up some goodies in it. Heats evenly, no bowing. Handle cool. However....In the description it states it is 15+ inches circumference ,but they probably meant with the little side handle included. The actual pan is 12"". It was smaller than I expected, but it's still a great pan. So if you're looking for a 12"". I would recommend! Wash and oil your pan before use, and it's an easy non-stick glide. Nice!"
I needed a Dutch oven to make a certain type of bread but didn’t have a lot of money to spend. This pan was very reasonable in price so I. Decided to try it. It was perfect. The bread cooked perfectly. I love this pot. it cleaned up easy and easy to store.
"I've only used them twice since getting them but I'm so very happy. they have a nice weight to them, sit evenly on the burners and my eggs didn't stick this morning, and the pancakes didn't stick yesterday! i did purchase a silicone spatula and a silicone scrubber to avoid scratching when cooking and cleaning."
"I am working towards slowly replacing my old cheap pots and pans and I've become a Calphalon fan. Every product looks good and cooks good. Don't think twice!  Worth noting: it is advertised as being safe for metal utensils; don’t. No nonstick will live long if you make a habit of using metal utensils. If you do, use extra caution that you're not scraping the pan."
"I've waited to give a review when my issue was addressed. I love the skillet, but I was charged for a set and only received one skillet. Thankfully, It was refunded because this is the best skillet I've tried so far. I cook a lot of eggs for my dogs mostly, and this skillet has been super easy to clean . However, if I have a full skillet, it is more difficult to clean the steel bolts connecting the handle. I wish that was done differently. That is my only complaint."
"I’m a long-time fan of Calphalon cookware. My first set of pans lasted for over 10 years. Wanted to get new frying pans of different sizes for quick, everyday meals. Super satisfied with my purchase of 2 Piece Classic Nonstick Frying Pan Set: great shape and size, easy to use and take care. Got them in August 2019- so far, so good: pans are in good condition/still non-sticky after almost daily use (8-inch pan is perfect for eggs/omelettes). I just follow few simple rules: no high heat, hand wash only and I use Calphalon Nylon All Purpose Turner. And price is great!"
"I’ve used Calphalon for years and I love the brand and their products. I let it at the sink with hot water after cooking and with proper washing soft sponges (NO SCRATCHING MATERIAL) everything gets removed quickly and it returns to normal, NO \SCRATCHES if handled as it should be."
"Love this brand, old one was getting a little scratched up. Love that this one has the lid. We use it almost everyday for something. Have to discipline myself to hand wash only. I have been lazy in the past and throw it in the dishwasher, reason probably why my pans don’t last. I would recommend and I would by again!"
"This has become the go to Skillet. I love that it’s wide and pretty flat with shallow sides. It holds a lot of food with plenty of space. There is a little bit of bow in the middle, but not much and once food is in, it hardly matters. (The fact that my stove isn’t level is a bigger problem!) it has gotten some visible scratches, but no coating peeling or flaking. It cooks very evenly. I’ve done batches of 8-10 scrambled eggs with no problems and no hot spots. It’s taken it’s place with my Lodge cast iron and my Revere Stainless Steel. I don’t end up using the lid most of the time, but it’s nice to have. I do wish it had a different type of knob."
"This replaced an older pan. Only complaint was that it was difficult to find, buried in hundreds and hundreds of Amazon photos. The 'Classic' doesn't seem to be a product line like some of the pan sets. Actually purchased another Calphalon model that turned out to be a shallow 'saute' pan, not what I wanted, FINALLY found it after another hour of searching deep into the product photos."
"I am so glad I did not pay attention to the negative reviews on this pan! It is my go to skillet for all my skillet meals now. Not too heavy when draining grease from ground beef or turkey is a big plus for me. Non-stick makes it a breeze to hand wash. And I have had no problems at all with the coating coming off, as a few other reviewers have mentioned. I love this pan so much, I bought a second one for my winter condo, as I don't want to be without it. Highly recommend!!!"
"I love this cookware, it doesn't matter if it is Teflon coated or not. I have been using this cookware since the 80's. This pan is deeper than the frying pan, you can sear you meats and continue adding and cook everything right in the same pan."
"We have had Calphalon for years and our pans finally wore out...they aren't supposed to, but too many overly heated food items (read as burned) caused us to have to look for new. These are not quite as heavy duty, but thus far are meeting our needs and because I still walk away from the stove, they have cleaned up nicely after leaving something in them a bit too long! (just as you should/would expect Calphalon to do!)"
"Calphalon pans have been in my kitchen for years. I have purchased several sets from Amazon and have also purchased them for gifts. I love them. The price has greatly increased. The pans now are much lighter, and thinner. I sure hope they hold up. They say ok for dishwasher but I can tell you from experience they don't last as long if you do put them in the dishwasher. Love these pans. As I said hope the NEW thinner style will last as long."
"I love my Calphalon 12"" fry pan. I bought it over a month ago, and have used it almost daily for all types of cooking and have had no issues. The food never gets stuck to the pan, and the pan is so easy to clean. I have washed it both by hand and in the dish washer and it always comes out looking like new. Both handles remain cool to the touch which is great. I use only wooden or silicon utensils to stir the food so as not to scratch the coating. I will be ordering a smaller 8"" pan next."
"Bought a full set of 8 pans / pots. I hand wash them every time. They are great pans, except for the rivets. Food sticks horribly to the rivet areas. I end up using a non-scratching type scouring pad, which I'm sure will reduce the durability over time. I will be looking for a set without rivets."
"I have had many sauté pans throughout my marriage of 39 years. Most of my pots and pans are Calphalon. Don’t ask me why I cheaped out on sauté pans. Every sauté pan I had I would take eventually take a hammer to it to flatten out the bottom as the all seemed to get a hump in the middle after time. This new pan is a dream. Sears beautifully on the stovetop. has a metal handle which doesn’t wiggle after time. Has a dome glass lid. Beat of all it is Calpalon quality. My husband even commented after he fried up some bacon, this is the best pan, the bacon doesn’t curl as it did in our other pans. I had to laugh, he doesn’t usually comment on cookware. I use this pan fir everything from pork roast to pasta sauce. It is our new go to pan. Thank you Calphalon for keeping your product standards throughout the years."
"This pan is like a horse. Like a horse, it is versatile, spacious, and capable of handling a wide variety of cooking tasks thrown at it. Like a thoroughbred, it has a thing gauge that allows it to handle significant heat. Like a racehorse, it is amazingly resistant to scratches and is mostly clean by the time it sits in the sink. If you have a large family, this is the best sort of horse you can buy - if you have a smaller group you are cooking for - just be sure you want a horse this big."
Great pans. Use to make over medium eggs. Flips easily without fat added to pans. We love this brand as they are very reliable. Just replaced our 25 yr old one. Recommend no dishwasher as the heat after a few years eats away the outside. Use rubber spatula always to keep Teflon safe. You won’t be disappointed. Great value with 2 sizes included.
"I got this to replace an old, non-stick, wok-shaped pan we used for various types of rice based dishes (primarily because it was cheaper than that style and we didn't cook on the slopes of the pan anyway). This pan has a larger base and steeper sides than that shape, although the overall diameter is the same. This pan heats quicker and more evenly than the one it replaced and we've been really happy with it over the first month. As with most non-stick pans, the real test will be longer term viability of the coating - time will tell."
"I use this pan for everyday cooking and sauteing; it is a good medium size, and it has its lid, two handles, and is versatile for cooking many things. Use a non-stick spatula or a wooden spoon with it of course."
"REPLACED A LIGHT WEIGHT, WONDER, COPPER NEVER STICK FRY PAN. I ALWAYS KEEP SALES SLIPS WHEN BUYING SOMETHING THAT PROMISES TO NEVER FAIL. THANKFULLY I DID NOT WANT TO RETURN THIS AGAIN. I HAD REPLACED THIS THREE TIMES IN 6 YEARS. I LOOKED FOR A NEW PAN AND CAME UP WITH THIS GEM. WITH TWO HANDLES IT HANDLES WITH CONFIDENCE. THIS ALLOWS THE PAN TO GO IN THE SINK. IF POSSIBLE I WOULD RATE IT HIGHER."
"I had ordered a cast iron version and while I am sure would have been excellent, it was just too heavy for me (arthritic hands). I knew I would drop at some point and may burn myself, plus make a big mess. So, I sent it back. I have other Calphalon pans so decided to try this one. It is substantial enough, but I can handle getting it in and out of oven without fear. Holds a lot! Love the high sides!"
I tried the copper pans and then the blue pans. They worked great for a couple months now they’re junk and everything sticks. These calphalons were only a little more money but the no stick is great. I won’t buy anything else from now on.
"After 50 years of cooking, this pan is like hitting the lottery. Heats quickly and evenly. Deep and wide to fit over the widest burner to use 'all' of it and not waste heat. Clean up is a breeze. Cover design is spot on with drain spout and clear cover."
I recently remodeled my kitchen and wanted new cookware to replace my 30 year old pots. Excellent quality. No stick without chemicals. Easy clean. Will last the next 30 years
"I have had many non-stick pans in my lifetime and these are hands down the best ones. I purchased the 8” and 10” pans which are just the right size for smaller cooking tasks. They are both sturdy, cool evenly and are extremely easy to clean."
"So far so good. I have another skillet the same as this and after 3 years It died. Everything sticks, no matter how much oil, or how slowly I cook whatever it is, temp wise. I'm going to baby this one hoping it will last as it's advertised it will. I've cooked one meal in it so far ... and its all good. So far."
"We have other Calphalon pans and we take excellent care of our cookware. This pan is warped after just over 3 months of use. Of course, the warranty is through the manufacturer and you have to pay to have the pan shipped, if they will even replace it. Shipping costs almost as much as the original item. Not good."
Nice deep sauté pan holds 3 quarts. I was looking for a 10 or 12” covered skillet to replace ones I’ve had for 25 years. This was an alternative choice but I’m happy with it because it can be all purpose. Still hoping to find a 10” covered skillet.
"I got these for my dad for Christmas since we always seem to ruin his “good nonstick pans” and these have held up super great !! Heats up fast, nothin sticks, and I basically just rinse it off every time I wash it because anything left on the pan comes straight off. I’m super happy with these pans, they’re affordable and really just work great!"
"Outstanding. That word describes these pans. I am very, very pleased with all aspects of the pans. Just made an omelet yesterday. Came out great and so easy to clean. I would purchase again, and highly recommend them to everyone looking for these types of pans! A++++++"
"We received a large set of these pans for our wedding a couple years ago. The pans we used for ever, and wore down. These worked as a great replacement and have new pans without having to replace the set."
"I love these Calphalon pans. I have been using them for years, since I couldn't find Viking anymore. I have a set of Calphalon, with the saucepans, dutch oven, 8 and 10 inch frying pans, and a 12 inch deep frying pan, so this was an addition for when the deep pan is too bulky. I love the pan. It is keeping up with the Calphalon quality that I have come to know and love. The only drawback? Amazon's typical packing jobs when they send things out (see pic) HUGE box with a pan banging around and one piece of paper in there for cushion. Who in the hell do they use to pack their products?"
I fell in love with Calphalon years ago. It is heavy duty cookware and cleans up beautifully. My old nonstick pan was really worn so I replaced it with this one. It's fantastic! And deeper than my original. Another great purchase!
"Love this. I can make just about anything now without concern for overflowing the pan :D I have done stovetop to oven at 400 degrees without any issues at all. Nothing sticks, easy to wash. Very even surface for cooking, definitely worth the price. Even if the coating does wear off one day (which it hasn't) it is affordable enough to replace."
"High quality, non stick, easy to clean, and heats evenly. What more could you want? These are the only two pans I use (even though I have others) because they’re a good size and I like them so much. I love that the handle doesn’t warm up - it makes it easy to pick up, but also I don’t accidentally burn myself while stirring!"
"I had been using Calphalon pots and pans for a long time. My frying pans had worn out from constant abuse, due to my ignorance. These new pans seem solidly made and seem fine to me. Things don't stick to them. I have no idea about features such as heat distribution and heat resistance. I do intend to follow the enclosed instructions for use. The price seemed to be okay."
"Beautiful pot, great quality, easy to clean and decent price!!"
We have only used it one time yet but we cooked sausage in it for a breakfast dish. Our old Teflon pan would allow the sausage to stick so hard we would have to soak it then scrape it before washing it. This new pan let the sausage slide right out when done! First time is awesome!
I love this pan. I use it almost every day. It keeps oil spatters down and is perfect for almost any stovetop need! I like that has high slanted sides. It is very easy to clean as well. Highly recommend.
"These pans are so easy to use!! They heat evenly, never, ever stick, clean up easily and are very attractive. They set I purchased were very reasonably priced. I highly recommend these pans."
"My husband and I rented a VRBO and found the pans too nasty to use. I had to have something that day to cook dinner, so we hurried to WalMart and bought two of these frying pans for $29. We've used them every day for 6 weeks, and LOVE THEM. I own All-Clad, Calphalon, Le Cruset, and Mauviel products to name a few. I used to work at Williams-Sonoma, so I know how to treat cookware. I can only assume that folks who've had trouble have unintentionally misused these pans. We have NEVER heated them beyond medium heat (and medium heat is plenty high to even sear foods in these pans if you add a little coconut oil - unrefined, organic, in glass, of course). We let them cool before cleaning - according to instructions. We use ONLY a flexible silicone spatula or tongs when moving food around. We never put them on a burner that bigger than the base of the pan, and always make sure it stays centered on the heat source. We use only a soft sponge or Dobie with the lightest bit of an environment friendly liquid detergent, and dry with a soft towel. They look brand new and perform to the highest of standards (mine). I plan to replace ALL of my non-stick cookware with GreenLife Ceramics when I get home and test them on my gas burners (we have electric in the rental). That's the only missing link as to why other users have had trouble if they're doing everything else right. If it works out like I anticipate...anyone want my scratched up expensive ""non-stick"" Calphalon for their workshop? Update: I love these pans so much I let my son have the first set, and I bought another set for myself, and the 12"" fry pan, too. The gas burners have caused the SLIGHTEST bit of wear to the flat area of bottoms. Barely noticeable and a non-issue for me since they're SO wonderful to cook with."
"I spent some time studying up on ""non stick"" pans. Decided against hard anodized and anything teflon based. My intent was to replace my 10"" pan which had lost it's muchness after a year of constant use. Face it. they all become useless in time. So far they are great. What surprised me is the 7"" pan is practically all I use. Thought it would be too small but it is perfect for a three egg over pan. Most of the negative reviews I see with pics show pans that had been overheated. Do not cook without an oil. Butter is better but olive oil is better for you. Or Canola or others.  Happy I got this set!"
This is the third and final time I will be updating this review. These pans are garbage. They start off amazing but the second you cook some meat in them they start going downhill. It's been about 2 months and the grease from the meat will stick directly to the pans even on medium heat and you have to scrape it off. Also the ceramic material is so weak it chips off like crazy around the edges. Do not buy these unless you only want to cook light foods like eggs or veggies
"If used correctly, these are really great non-stick pans. They only last about a year before needing to be replaced entirely, but considering we use them every single day I'm ok with that. They REALLY need to be babied though or they will not last at all: medium-low heat only, wooden or silicone spoons, hand-washed with a non-abrasive sponge. My only complaint is that the bottoms get ugly and scratched almost right away.  UPDATE! These crapped out on me within four months this time. Wow. They lost their nonstick ability basically overnight - everything started sticking and the bottoms became stained with burn marks. We cared for these even more carefully than our first set, too. Not cool!"
"My local Publix sells Greenlife pans, and I really like them. I needed a new 10” pan after using mine for 8 years, saw the soft grip handle option here, and had to try it. I really like the feel of the handle as I’m cooking. I won’t lie, I’ve destroyed a few pans learning how to use them. Here is what I learned. First mistake, don’t use high heat with them. This lesson was hard to learn. It really doesn’t take a lot of heat to make these pans hot. Just above medium on my stove is enough to make it hot enough to fry with. If you go to a medium high or high heat on your stove, you will burn your food and ruin your pan. Stick to a low or medium heat. I also think the folks who were complaining of the handles melting were cooking on a high heat. Second mistake, don’t use any spray oils in the pan. Spray on oils like Pam will coat your skillet in an oil that will permanently stick to the ceramic, stain your pan, and destroy the natural non stick surface. Use regular oils like butter, olive oil, coconut oil or vegetable oil. Plus, just a tiny bit of oil will go a long way with the natural non-stick qualities of ceramic pans. If you over do the oil on too high a heat, you will destroy your pans. Third mistake, using metal tools on the skillet. I beat the hell out of my first skillet using a metal spatula. I switched to olive wood and bamboo tools, and they do great. They don’t scratch the surface at all. Fourth mistake, running water in the skillet while it is still hot. I ruined the surface by repeatedly doing that. I was thinking I needed to put it to soak, but learned that if I just let it cool, the food came right off when I washed it with a sponge and soap. I don’t have a dishwasher to know if that is good to do or not. Mine have always been hand washed. Are these pans going to last you the rest of your life? No, but they will last you several years if you use them properly, and at this price that’s not a bad deal."
"I've been using these every day for the past several months and I don't have any problems. It's important to read the directions carefully to know how to properly take care of ceramic cookware. Certain cooking oils cannot be used on this cookware. Sprays should never be used. Also heat should not be turned up past medium. Finally they should be allowed to cool before washing.  Edit: 6 years later and these pans look almost as good as new. There are no scratches, peeling or discoloration of the white ceramic coating, nor of the turquoise paint. Even the bottom of the pans are fine. The handle's silicone has darkened a bit because I regularly put them in the oven."
"I’ve had this for a while and I’ve been intentionally waiting to review them to make sure that they were going to hold up. Skillets are one of those things that just never seem to be able to hold up in my house. With three teenagers cooking it seems like they kill pans constantly. If it can survive my kids, it’s well worth the money. I would definitely buy them again if needed. They cook nice and even and they’re very easy to clean up. Their nonstick surface has lasted and I’m impressed by them."

These two ceramic frying pans are the best...I have had many of this type of pan over the years. They usually last for only a while. I was surprised of the quality of these two pans. They are not lightweight neither are they very heavy. They work amazing. You have to add some butter or oil in the pan after heating. So far I have cooked scrambled eggs...heating up different foods...even made a burger and all of them came out great. The cleanup is incredible..just rinse and the pan looks like it was never used.... .You virtually only wipe the pan down....what I like the most is making one thing ..cleaning it off...and then adding whatever else I'm cooking. I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of these pans and wasn't sure when I received them if they would be good or not...but I'll tell you I have no regrets....they are amazing!...I will only purchase ceramic frying pans for health purposes.....these have more than met my expectations and I would highly recommend them!
It’s bizarre to me how people in the comment are so not careful on this pan. They use metal utensils on it and blame the pan when it chips. We have used the pan for five months now. The only scratch is one time accident by a metal spoon. All my utensils are wooden to protect the coating. It’s such a beautiful pan. Me and my boyfriend both love it. It’s light most importantly non toxic !
"As a pink loving girl, I was delighted for these frying pans to arrive and to begin cooking in them. I wanted to test them before I ordered the complete set. Following directions, I only used the recommended oil or butter. I never went above medium heat and after 5 times using the small frying pan, today I discovered ceramic chipping around the entire rim of the pan. Concerned that the small pieces might’ve have gotten into my food, sadly I won’t be using it again and will be in search of a set that has durability & sustainability."
Awful!!!! After two months they've lost their nonstick. Such a waste of money!!!
This skillet is nice and lite weight. I ordered yellow. I make sure never to go above medium heat and immediately after use I wipe it out with a paper towel. Once it is completely cool I wash it with a non abrasive pad. Food slides out every time.

"These are great. I have had then for a little over 5 months. They cook well. Heat distribution is even. Clean up is easy. READ THE DIRECTIONS. The larger pan my son used every day (yes, EVERY day) to cook his eggs and bacon. If you read the directions and do what is says these will work for you. You cannot use cooking spray. I have used only butter and olive oil. You let them cool and clean them off. Only once did my son use them for quesadillas and the cheese got stuck and cooked on. I had to use a magic eraser for that mess but it cleaned up. The inside of my pans look exactly like they did when I got them. The outside, not so pretty, but who cares...the inside is completely functional. You need to follow the directions and NOT USE cooking spray. And wash it after you use it, don't let it sit. But even if you did (admittedly, my son did a few times before I gently reminded him), the mess will still come off. I love them and am buying the 12"" and a 14"" in another brand."
"Great product. I bought the pair of skillets several years ago and have been very satisfied with them. No sticking, easy to clean, etc. I still use them in fact. I washed them in the dishwasher even though it’s not recommended and they have held up well.  About a year ago I bought a pair of skillets at Costco. I’ve already had to throw one of the Costco pair away. And I was careful with them! I did not wash the Costco ones in the dishwasher and I only used a soft rag to clean. I couldn’t believe when in less than a year my scrambled and/or fried eggs started sticking to the pan. I used an avocado spray (similar to Pam) when cooking. I don’t know if that was what caused the sticking problem or not. It never caused a problem with my Greenlife pair. All I know is I had to throw the Costco skillet most used away!  I needed another small skillet so I came back to Amazon and bought another Greenlife pair. I have used the avocado spray often on the Greenlife skillets I purchased years ago with no problems but I’m not using it this recent purchase (just in case). So now I have an old set that I continue to put in the dishwasher and use a Pam-like spray on and a newer pair that I do none of that with.  The point I am trying to make is I HIGHLY recommend this pair of skillets. I wish they came with lids but I make do with other saucepan lids."

"I bought some skillets from Rachel Ray & they quickly warped. They did not cook well but these are great. I followed the directions about cooking at medium because high heat was not needed. True! It takes a while for my electric stove to get warm so I start on a 3 on burner indicator, then after a few min I go to 5-6 on my burners. I was overjoyed with the way it cooked the bacon on 5. I’ve tried other veg & meats and they also browned up nicely. I didn’t put in until it was hot on 5. I put bacon in cold and watched the way it heated up and then cooked the bacon. These 2 sizes were perfect for what I’ve used them for in last months. I am delighted with these & totally worth there price. When cool I run a little warm water and soap - extremely easy to clean."
"I saw the mixed reviews but my aunt bought them and watched it with my own eyes and decided to try! Glad I did. We have bought many non-stick pans and thrown them all out since it’s not true non-stick. These are! I have ground meats, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, made sauce. All non stick! I spray a little bit of zero calorie butter (since that’s my choice - I know you can use EVOO also) and in my food goes. Slides around and doesn’t stick. I ground turkey and brown it with ease. Slides right out. If there are any marks from it just sitting longer in one spot, once it cools, wipes out with a paper towel! Insane! I have not put it in the dishwasher and I wash it by hand each time to assure it doesn’t get scratched or damaged. No chips yet and have used it many times! I got the mint color and the large and small pan set. True mint color to match my kitchen and cream/off white inner. Very pretty, sleek design and easy to clean. Stores inside each other well and in the on drawer! Worth it for sure. We want to get the matching oven pan trays and cake pans!"
"Not sure why these have awful reviews? They’re great non stick, easy to clean, eggs slide right off. It’s recommends not using nonstick spray, maybe people are doing that. We’ve used both pans for a few weeks and are super impressed. Our fancy pots and pans from our wedding already were trashed and we took a chance on these"
"Love non toxic non stick so easy to wash! I wish I bought a darker color because the bottom of pan where it touches electric stove top gets burned looking, but the inside is perfect and I love it more than all my expensive gourmet pans!"
"Update 9/26. The only negative I can find is that they do absorb odors.  I was starving because I was waiting for these to arrive. Breakfast was somewhere between lunch and dinner...linner? OK, having read many, many reviews, I had the basics down for what to do/not do. Washed, dried, grabbed the eggs, leftover rice, mixed vegetables, and soy, etc, heated the pan while finding the butter, prepped my eggs, and got out a wooden utensil. Then I dropped the butter and poured in the eggs. Coming off cast iron, I wondered if there was such a thing as too slippery, as the eggs sailed across the pan...had to strategize so I could fry, turn, and chop the eggs into appropriately sized bites. Added veg and rice, and the rest. These pans are so anti-stick, I shared some of my food with the counter.  My thoughts about some of the negative reviews: If they scratch, metal tools are being used or the smaller pan is stored in the larger pan without protection. If the finishes are coming off, I’d guess too high a heat is being used or the pans were not allowed to cool down. Think stainless; hot to cold warps the center. Apples to oranges, but higher heats cause damage. If the bottoms scratch, well, that should be expected unless cooking on a glass top.  In summary: These pans require a different approach than do cast iron, which I’ll continue using for a good sear. As this is day one, I’ll review again in a couple of months. There aren’t any stars for durability as I’ve no clue how they’ll perform long-term. And I should probably read the instructions before dinner as I’m cooking chicken."
"I first used this brand of pan at my sister-in-law's house and fell in love with them. After a couple of months of looking at them and reading the reviews of others, I finally ordered a set of two pans. I really can't conceive why anyone wouldn't love these. If you cook with butter or oil (no Pam) and hand wash, you should have no problem. I've cooked cheesy eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, onions, mushrooms, ground meat, etc. and I have had absolutely NO sticking or hot spots. The pans have a nice heft without breaking your wrist. I really love them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone."
"I’ve had these pans less than 2 weeks, but they are awesome! I don’t know how they will hold up over the long term but I love them. They quickly clean with warm water, soap and a paper towel. They don’t have an odor before, during or after cooking. I’ve made steaks, pancakes, hash browns and vegetables. You really don’t need to cook at more than medium heat. I’m happy because my old non-stick pans would cause my air purifier to register a red warning for toxins in the air. These pans don’t register at all with the air purifier."
"The pots and pans are great so far, I have had the large saute pot with lid since last year and love it so much that I ordered more to match it. The clean easy, you need to read the instructions and follow them!!! Don't use them on high heat these pans work fine on med heat. if you need to go to med-high but not for to long. only use plastic on them and don't use harsh scrubby's such as sos pads. I love them they are pretty and work great. I preheat my frying pans first with oils, they cook just fine. They clean so easy!!! LOVE THEM!"
"Absolutely Love! These pans are well made, clean , easy to cook with. I have had them for several weeks. I treat them like I would a skillet. I am definitely buying more! I would recommend buying silicone utensils. Wood, metal and plastic are still tough on pots. I only use those on my metal pans. I haven’t had any scratches, burns or bad food. It comes right off. I let cool then I rinse with a little soap and sponge. Clean!"
"Update 3mo's after using every day, the pans are still white inside. I'm simply amazed.  I am so impressed with the quality of these pans. I have been buying ceramic pans from discount stores for a couple years now & replacing them every few months, because oil stains them. I have been using these daily with oil. And not one spot of brown or yellow. So happy. I actually use less oil than with other ceramic pans. And am taking care not to use high heat. I believe these will last me a long time 😊"
"My husband and I really like these pans. They are non-toxic (compared to other non-stick pans) and they're really NON-STICK! Warning: Do NOT use sprays on these pans. We did that with our last set and after several years, we really destroyed the non-stick coating. Just use a tiny dab of butter or oil. You could probably use them without ANYTHING at all, but we like a little bit of flavor. Also, do not use maximum heat with these. Stick with low to medium heat so you don't damage them. Clean up is super easy and requires almost no scrubbing. We really like them!"
"Although the GreenLife is not the GreenPan, they are both owned by the same corporation that claims the sand non-stick coating allegedly creates 60% less CO2 emissions. GreenLife is claimed to be environmentally conscious as is GreenPan. I chose GreenLife simply because I liked the idea of having red pans. Super non-stick. Easy clean. It is DW safe, but tro ensure longer life it is recommended to hand-wash. More like tilting it into the sink and watching everything slide off. (Of course I do wash it - not a total lazy a**.) Good value for price!"
"I cook a LOT. I have burned every pan I've owned - and I haven't burned these yet, I imagine they will sooner or later. But for now, they are fantastic. Cooking (eggs or whatever) without ANY oil they slide right off! (don't do that, use a drop or two!).  They are not especially ""light weight"" but then you don't want something that feels flimsey - these feel sturdy, comfortable. I have not tested them in the oven (it says you can use them in the oven - but I'm skeptical because the handles are some kind of comfortable plastic - but then who knows, maybe they'd be fine).  They clean very easily, solid feel, food slides right off - LOVE them. Also, I'm surprised they still sell pans in the US with teflon which can still release harmful gas if left on the burner unattended!"
"Nonstick - YES! Lightweight - YES! Pretty - YES! I love these pans so far. I've only had them for about a month. They have not lost any of their beautiful non-stick-ability yet. I've been careful to follow the instructions: Don't heat them on high; don't use cooking spray. I hand wash them (very easy clean-up). I'm so happy to have found pans that don't have toxic chemicals and are GREAT FOR COOKING EGGS, even with little oil. Yes, I have to be more patient as they heat up on medium (instead of heating on high, which I can do with my cast iron pans). But once heated, they seem to cook food faster at lower temps than my previous (teflon-type) pans. I have heard that the durability of the ceramic coating is not as good as that of other (toxic) pans, but I haven't had them long enough to comment on that."
"After reading reviews, it clicked these are still teflon non-stick but superior to the 'older' designs & that was grate for me with my black coated pans flaking new was needed. Here's the trick, keep below medium heat & DON'T use spray oil or metal utensils. Then it's the best egg pan ever also good for sauteing veggies but really that is all a non-stick pan is for. For high heat cooking get yourself cast iron or stainless steal. Chefs know it, you should too."
"I really love these products. However, if it is used for direct cooking with propane gas ( as opposed to natural gas or electric), unfortunately I found it is not a good choice for the pans, particularly. The reason is something about the propane heat causes stains on the outside of the beautiful turquoise finish and I can't get them off. Also, somehow the cooking oxidizes on the inside and stains that tool. I can get it off but only with an abrasive, which you aren't supposed to use on this product anyway. Disappointing in that regard. However, it is a really well made product and I love how it cooks. Easy to clean if used for baking. It appears to only be an issue with stove top cooking."
"I was steaming pumpkin , second day after I got it- and i forgot to turn off stove, so left over pc burned to ashes i was so sad ! thinking my new pan is gone but I put water on it and black just peeled off! amazing great product, thank you"
Bought these pans to take with us in our camper but loved it so much that I've taken it in the house and it's replaced my very expensive set of pots and pans. Make sure to follow directions and NOT use pan spray only use butter or oils. This cleans like a dream. May order a color that matches my kitchen but at this point I don't care what color the pan is
"There is nothing to dislike about this pan. It is without question the smoothest, easiest pan to make an omelet or crepe in that I've ever used. I dash of soap and some warm water, and it is clean. I am careful to only use a medium low heat setting, and have used the bigger counterpart for several years. It has never lost it's nonstick quality. It heats up quickly, and is very even heat. If I could use regular utensils in it, this would be the only pan I'd ever use!"
I love that the 2 skillets are not heavy. The coating prevents food from sticky IF you read the directions. I got in a hurry and washed it and fried some ground chicken that stuck a bit. This is my second set but it doesn’t cook like the first set. I use spray oil in the first set. This set says not too. If you follow the directions it turns out fine.
"I wanted a ceramic non stock pan that was chemical free because we recently got a parrot. I needed a safer more healthy non stick pan and I’ve heard ceramic is a great alternative to Teflon. I use stainless steel to cook most things except eggs. They always burn and stick to the pan, or I have to use a ton of butter which is not ideal for me. I cooked eggs this morning with the new pan and the eggs were perfect. I used a few drops of olive oil and it turned out great. Easy to clean as well. I would definitely recommend."
"So easy to clean!!! Eggs, pasta sauce, literally ANYTHING comes right off. Love this product. You don’t need to use as high heat or it will start to brown, very fast conductor"
"These make me happy every time I pull one out of the cabinet. They look great. They're fun compared to my old, dark pots/pans. The porcelain makes it very easy to see any bit of dust. I didn’t realize how many dirt specks were on my pots/pans just from sitting in the cabinet before. My kid loves the smallest pot for Mac-n-cheese, and the smallest skillet for pancakes (it’s pancake sized). I couldn’t be happier with these."
"I purchased these mostly because they were fairly inexpensive and I needed something to replace my old ones where the Teflon was flaking off (so, so bad!). I was not expecting to use these long term and was planning on saving up for a top line set of pots and pans. I've put more of these pots and pans on my wish list. I'm extremely impressed with the slick cooking surface and sturdiness of these. They are super easy to clean, even melted cheese and egg (I let my 10 year old make eggs) were able to just be wiped off with a dish towel."
"These are excellent and sturdy pans. We were worrying Ed that the light color would lead to noticeable scratching or permanent staining. So far, we have no dings or stains - high praise from a household with 2men and one boy!"
"I looooooooove them. I have been following the advised instructions about cooking below high heat and using butter and refined oils as well as how to clean. And it is by far the best pan I’ve ever had. Please do not use metal utensils, only wooden or silicone types. Foods just slide right off and cleaning is like a dream. If your food is sticking, you are not doing it right. Can’t stress enough how much I’m so happy about this purchase."
They are everything they say they are…. I use a pat of butter when I preheat the pan on a low to medium heat. Nothing sticks to this pan. And you can literally wipe it clean with a damp rag when you are finished cooking. They are comfortable (handle) and appear to be incredibly durable. I bought the two piece seven and 10 inch pans. I look forward to buying the larger pan and the other pots that they have.
"Love these pans. I was wanting non toxic cookware and got a set for Christmas. I had to repurchase the smaller pan because my daughter used a scrubbie to clean the pan. It ruins the finish. The only downfall is you need to be super careful to only use a sponge to clean, never scrub. If stuff is sticking I soak for a little bit. Stuff does not stick often as these are quality pans, but it does happen. They get hot quick! You do not need super high heart. It was a learning curve for me as I burned a few things. Worth it though for the nontoxic properties. These will be my only pans going forward."
"I have had these pans for a month now and they still look good as new. Cooks very well, heats up quickly, are nonstick and easy to clean."
I had been using a Cuisinart non-stick pan for a few years and noticed that the voting was a bit scratched. I knew it was time to replace it with something chemical-free. Did some googling and thought I’d give these a try. They heat quickly and evenly and have gotten the job done with minimal clean up. The soft-grip handles are a nice touch and the colors are lovely. Highly recommend.
So far....they are durable. I have not had them for long. MOST IMPORTANT TO KNOW. Never clean with detergents at all. Rinse with HOT water and towel dry. Use ONLY a low or med heat. Take a little longer to preheat before use. It retains its heat so it will continue to cook after the heat has been turned off. Good to know for scrambled eggs. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"If you use cooking spray these pans are not for you! It will ruin them! I have followed instructions to the T and they are wonderful!!! No sticking, no burning bottom of the pans like some reviewers have stated! When you follow the correct directions they will be the best pans ever"
I need light weight cookware due to my carpal tunnel. I wish they sold the frying pans seperately because I really just needed the smallest one for my egg frying but I guess its fine to have a bigger one on hand for bigger dishes just in case. I already own the pots and I love the color options and the way they cook and clean up is wondeful! I feel safer with this than teflon. Thanks Green Life!
"I am in LOVE with these pans! I bought these before buying the whole set because I wanted to make sure they would do the job well. Usually you get what you pay for, so I was a bit skeptical with the price of these being so low. I am absolutely thrilled with them so far though. I've been using them for a week and they're a dream to cook on. They are EVEN BETTER than non-stick/teflon pans! My food cooks evenly, all you need is a silicone spatula or wooden spoon (the spatulas work better on these though), and they're so nonstick I just have to wipe them with a paper towel to clean! Even with my non-stick pots and pans, I was still having to soak and wash them. I'm in love with these and can't wait to buy the whole set. They're a beautiful color too, and I especially love that I'm not putting toxins in my body every time I cook."
"I love to cook (no microwave here) and many pans these days (except the good old cast iron) don't require the use of oils, butter, or sprays and using them can damage their finish. Let's face it, you can't pan fry a steak, saute mushrooms and onions or even have a decent looking pancake without butter and/or oil (don't use sprays). These pans are easy to clean, heat evenly and don't require high heat and permit you to create the best tasting ""And"" looking (presentation counts) meals, I highly recommend them to anyone who loves to cook.:-)"
"These are the only pans we buy because they do NOT have the screw heads that hold the handles on inside of the skillets/pans. That makes the entire cooking surface non-stick. In all the others, there are screw heads inside the cooking area which are a pain to clean if you are fixing anything sticky."
"Beautiful and durable! I ordered these used/repackaged and the protective packaging was off the pans when they arrived (I ordered them as repackaged...) In spite of a scratch on the rim of the larger pan after being loose and banging against each other, these pans, on the cooking surface, are perfect. I have some other new non-stick pots that I've learned I have to be fairly careful to not scratch and so lose the non-stick surface, but these are already different. They cook sticky things with no stick at all and clean up as though nothing had been in them at all and there is no sign of a scratch from stirring in them.  They are also just plain pretty pans. I like having them hanging in my kitchen. I like the soft handle too."
"What I love about the pans is that they are a joy to cook with and easy to clean. Not only do they make cooking so much easier, you can actually hold and move the pans easily. Some pans are too heavy to use and others aren't able to be cleaned easily. These pans to what they say they will do. It was actually a treat to use these pans."
The best part of these cooking pans is that they are healthier than other types of non-stick pans. Easy to clean and cooks well.
"These are the most non-stick pans I've ever owned. Eggs, cheese, meat, nothing sticks and the pans wipe out clean of even oil or butter. I wish I could put them in the oven, and I wish they came with lids to finish an omelette, but they do what they were designed for very well."
"One thing I have learned with pans is to read their instructions. These pans are meant for medium to low temperature cooking and that is what they are great for. They are so easy to clean if you do use them properly! I cook eggs on them potatoes and more. I would stay away from cooking bacon in these as I would be afraid that they would cook off the surface, bacon is better on cast-iron"
I typically don't do reviews unless the product is awful or exceedingly great. These pans are the latter. I like them so much I'm buying them as gifts for family members. They heat up evenly and are very easy to clean. I've used them at least once daily for several months and they still look like new. I wash them by hand not in the dishwasher. I also do not use any metal utensils on them.
I'm angry I didn't discover these sooner. They're so great! Easy to cook and clean. Supposed to be much better than nonstick which is good cause I use them mainly for cooking for my kids and stainless steel gets tarnished looking after a while.
"I am loving these pans after my girlfriend introduced me to them and this 2 pan set is so much less expensive than buying it in the box stores!! My gf paid this price for 1 Pan!! I got 2 incredible pans for the price of one and you REALLY can try an egg without any oil!! It sears meats beautifully, cleans up so fast- NO Stickons!! And it wears beautifully!! I have been using it for over a month th out a mark!! Make sure you use plastic utensils but wow! This even is making me ignore my favorite cast iron for its light weight and quick clean ups!"
"The pans have exceeded my expectations so far. I chose to buy these mainly for health reasons, as I read they are PTFE, PFOA, lead and cadmium free. I didn't expect the non-stick quality to be as good!  I've used the small pan daily (only for a few weeks) for frying eggs. There is no staining at all and I love how the egg just glides off the pan with such ease!  I watched a youtube video of someone using the pan for frying eggs in this pan. Some people seemed to get put off because in the video, the person didn't use any oil and (as I've found), this seems to create a thin crispy film on the eggs. However, I've discovered that by using a tiny drop of oil (light olive oil - not virgin), and I mean little (not more than 1/4 teaspoon is needed), no crispy film develops.  I don't use EVOO with the pans. I've read some reviews which say it may stain the pan. I've had no problems using light olive oil.  I also tried frying chicken with the larger pan yesterday and stir frying vegetables. It was okay! I (only dared) used medium heat only so it took much longer to cook than using my wok. My wok sticks easily when I cook chicken with it, but for this first use, I loved that it didn't stick with this pan at all! I unfortunately slightly overcooked the chicken, but found it still did not stick to the pan - yay!  As it's not long since I've been using the pans, it will be interesting to see how long these favorable comments last!  I do make sure I don't use EVOO or metal utensils, use low-medium heat only and I make sure I let pan cool before cleaning. Another tip I read and found useful was to use kitchen paper to wipe both sides of the pans after use and any unwanted dirt or marks come off so easily. Then I use a small amount of dish-washing liquid and water to clean with soft sponge after it has cooled.  In terms of the vendor, I received these pans a week sooner than stated during ordering so shipping was fast! I was very concerned about buying ceramic products online for international shipping, but I couldn't find these anywhere in my country, so I thought I'd risk buying it here on Amazon. They fortunately came without any scratches or defects and seemed well packaged enough.  For now, I'm so happy I bought these. Out with all the teflon pans (which didn't seem as non-stick as these GreenLife ones anyway!) and at a reasonable price.  As I say, it's early days yet though. It remains to be seen if the non-stick qualities fail after a few months (as it seems to have done for other buyers)."
Love these! Even my boyfriend loves that I bought them even if they are super pink. Easy to clean and super non stick. So excited to toss my old ugly set
"Love these. Good tastes better in these. They are dreamy to cook in, and the best pans for glass top stoves. They have sealed bottoms so they don't deposit melted aluminium onto the glass like stainless steel pans with aluminium glad bottoms. I would not use anything else on glass top stoves. They can be a nightmare to keep clean if you have the wrong pans.  You cannot use metal in these EVER! Chuckle. If you lack self control in that area, don't buy these. Wood or plastic only for these"
"Love, love these pans. Well made. Have a nice weight to them and the color is so beautiful. You can cook on low heat and pan cooks evenly. They are amazing !!!"
"I've only bought this brand, GreenLife, for years. It's so awesome. I love how they're built so sturdy and well. They're built much better than most non-stick cookware. They last forever, with proper use and care. And, I love the colors. Happy I continue to buy this brand."
Fantastic cookware my wife just loves the fact that they are super easy to clean and it does not take a lot to heat up the pan as it heats up evenly. Best pans I ever bought no more Teflon breaking down because it's ceramic and is way better as a stick free surface. I recommend you will not be disappointed.
I don’t usually take the time to write reviews but I’ve depended so much on customer reviews of late that I decided I needed to start writing reviews myself. I’ve used these pans for about a month now and feel I’m in a better place to do a review. The pans are easy use and easy clean. Let them (and any pan for that matter) cool before washing. My cook temp is never over medium and I use wood or silicone utensils. Lastly I only use them for eggs. What a joy to cook eggs in these pans. They literally slide out of the pan.
"These pans are attractive and they cook evenly and with minimal oil needed. They are sturdy, easy to clean and I have enjoyed both sizes. If you have a small portion to cook, the smaller pan is perfect and the larger pan is a great middle size for larger quantities."
"I like this brand. I have 8 inches and 10-inch skillets. I like both of them. I have been using them for almost a year never had an issue. I bought this one, my pans are not enough to fry cabbage or cauliflower whole at a time. This one is more spacious and easy to stir in the pot with no spillovers. I am glad it still the same quality no food sticking to the pot. I made cauliflower fry, transfer the food just wiped the pan with a towel, and start cooking again. Less washing. I am washing in dishwasher still coating works the same with no issues. The most I like the how big it is easy I can cook for 6 people. The lid and handle design look nice and sturdy."
Got it today and used it tonight for supper. Very nice pan. Nice even bottom that heats evenly. Used on my flat top electric stove. The directions said to hand wash so didn't use my dishwasher and hand washed and it was easy to clean. I'm gonna buy another one.
Loved the even heat distribution of this pan. Maybe only used a tsp of cooking oil in pan and cooked beautifully for stir fry. Good investment. Reasonably priced. Not too heavy to lift for me. All in all this is the brand I will be sticking with. Cleaned like a breeze with sponge and hot soapy water. Don't use scouring pads. No need. Had for 3 months. Use often..no scratches.
"I purchased a small Sensarte frying pan awhile back and it was great and well made. So, I bought this large, deep pan and a large frying pan and am very pleased with both. They seem to heat evenly, no sticking and work great. I used this deep pan for stir fry and it was perfect."
"In June of 2021 I purchased the Sensarte 8-inch and 9.5-inch pans and fell in love. I have been eyeing the 11-inch pan ever since and finally bought it yesterday. When I don't want non-stick I cook with All-Clad, so I like good pans. Sensarte fits the bill. I marinate boneless, skinless chicken breasts in Italian dressing and I used to cover a broiler pan with foil and broil them. Not any longer. Now I take the BSCBs out of the marinade and place them into the Sensarte pan. The chicken is delicious, nicely browned and the dressing (which has turned almost black by the time I am finished cooking) wipes out with a paper towel. The pans heat evenly, so no hot spots.  While the smaller pans came with handles attached, this one arrived with the handle neatly packaged in it's own little box. The screw and washer are inserted into the pan for a twist or two. Sensarte also provided a rather nice screwdriver! First step of installation directions tell you to take the screwdriver, screw and ""iron ring"" out of the package. I went through the packaging to make sure I hadn't lost the ""iron ring"" and finally decided they must have meant the washer. *sigh* That being said, the handle went on easily and feels very sturdy. I am very pleased with these pans."
Perfectly made pan for cooking .heat is balanced all over the pan. Mostly if you have to do fry this is the best pain . And the cover of the pan is well made and very strong handel
"I have only used this skillet once but it worked very well and was truly non-stick. The food cooked nicely and there was absolutely no sticking. The food literally slid out of the pan. It is quite large and will handle a big order of whatever you are cooking quite well. The pan is much lighter than I expected, so I hope that it does not prove to be less of a workhorse. I got rid of my old Calphalon non-stick skillet, which has lost almost all of its non-stick quality. But it was quite heavy and conducted the heat throughout the cooking process very well. I cannot say for sure if this pan will do the same or not b/c I have not used it enough yet. Hopefully it will. In the meantime, it does appear to be a very high quality skillet."
"While I like this pan, I wouldn’t buy it again and don’t recommend.  The good parts: The lid! Most pans don’t come with lids and this was one of the reasons I bought it. The size is larger than what I had been looking for, but now that’s one of the things I really like about it. I cooked a tomato based sauce and it didn’t stain which was something I’d been concerned with. So far, the pan has continued to be nonstick.  What I don’t like: The bottom isn’t flat. The instructions say to use some type of oil or fat when using, but when I do, it all goes to the edge of the pan. This makes for uneven browning. I also tried to fry eggs in this pan and no matter where I put them in the pan, they ended up at the edges. This isn’t acceptable. I would also wish the pour spout was on the other side or on both sides. I don’t usually pour away from me, but rather pour towards me, so the pour spout isn’t useful."
"It was about time I started looking for new sauté pan ( I cook a lot !! ) and came across this one. I wasn't sure at first if I should order it , but I did . And boy was I surprised !!! This pan is made so well I couldn't believe it !!!! And I love the look of it !!! ( that's what drew me to it originally ) So of course I had to put it to the test and it was wonderful !! It says to rub a very small amount of oil around the pan before use and use low heat at first to kind of pre-heat the pan.......it worked great and I just love the pan , so I ordered another one without a cover and smaller.......now I have 2 wonderful pans that will last a long time. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants a well made non stick pan."
"I purchased this pan for my son who was moving on to his own place. The pan needed to be able to cook evenly on a convection stove, and to be easy to clean. My son tells me that this pan meets all the criteria very well. In my opinion, this is a beautiful pan. (I want one.) He did forget to rub a minimal amount of cooking oil on the pan from time to time as per the maintenance instructions, but he said that a little soaking easily removed the stuck on eggs. I have a saute pan similar to this one, and eggs can stick a little if I forget to rub a small amount of cooking oil on it ever so often. The Sensarte pan does what its description says it will do. Based on what my wonderful but very picky son says and the fact that I have a similar type pan, I do recommend this Sensarte pan. (In fact, as soon as I submit this review I am going to order one for me!)"
"This pan is EVERYTHING...beautiful, easy to clean, sturdy and cooks food perfectly! When I opened my box I was blown away by the packaging...I mean they sent along a screwdriver to put the beautiful wood handle on with!!! I couldn't believe the quality, the packaging and then with a couple of tight turns...the pan was ready to wash and use! SENSARTE made is SOOOO simple! The beauty and elegance of this pan is incredible. I immediately cooked a piece of salmon to perfection in my new pan and I LOVE IT!!! Don't hesitate and look no further...I am ready to collect more pieces of this cookware even though this pan could be used for everything."
"I love this new pan. I am able to cook at a lower heat and I am very impressed with the consistency of the temperature throughout the whole cooking process. With the taller sides, I make less of a mess. It is very easy to clean since there is no hardware for food to get stuck on inside the pan. The handle feels very secure. The ability to use the pour spouts on either side of the plan helps with draining. The bonus is that the pan is beautiful in itself. We ended up buying a small pan for my husbands breakfast also. I highly recommend, do not even hesitate."
"I have been looking for the perfect pan to cook perfect spanish rice. My old pan stopped producing. the lid didn't close tightly anymore. I wanted a big enough pan to cook 4-5 cups cooked spanish rice. This fit the bill. I just tried it for the 1st time and WOW. rice cooked evenly, fluffy, and did not stick at all. funny how you can use all the same methods, and ingredients and it will come out differently. This pan gets 5 stars! Its new so I can't comment on the wear & tear yet - stay tuned! : )"
I have been searching for years for an everyday go to pan that food don't stick to. I have cooked everything in this pan and nothing will stick. Food cooks fast and evenly. It literally wipes clean with a paper towel. I like that it has some weight to it and doesn't slide around on the stove. I can drain grease with the pouring edge. I think this pan is awesome. I am not easily pleased. I love this pan.
"When I received it, I realized it was a bit larger than I expected and wasn't sure I would use it that much, HOWEVER, it is so easy to cook in and clean, I have used it 2 out of 3 days and am loving it. Have had it only a few days so time will tell. I am following the instructions about heating it up slowly with oil or something in it and washing it by hand and so far, so good! Highly recommend it. Love the depth of the skillet also."
"First off, this came with a screwdriver! That was nice to have. This is not heavy at all. My other skillets are much heavier. I noticed when cooking in it, not as much food gets pushed out the sides because of the height. I'm a fan of this so far. It was easy to wash clean. The food cooked evenly. I have fried in it and used it to simmer. It did a great job."
"Better than the ones we used to purchase and loved. We chose this one because the reviews on the other one had dropped but this one works well, no non-stick peeling etc. We particularly like the size, the ease of cleaning, and the spout. We have struggled with different lids to drain what we'd been cooking, but with the spout and lid, super simple. For the price it's a great product."
"I am replacing all my pans with Sensarte pans, they are that good. I have mastered the French omlet, thanks to Sensarte. I love browning meat in them, cooks soups, start to finish. My husband loves washing them. They rarely make it off the stove top. One by one I will own them all. And this one, my first, came disassembled and they sent screwdriver with it. Come on, who does that."
"This pan replaced one of the Gotham copper pans. I feel this is more durable so far. I have used it most everyday for over a month and it looks like the day I took it out of the box. It’s depth is a real plus too, helping keep the stove top from getting too splashed up from cooking. Having the lid is great too. I highly recommend this pan!!"
"I love everything about this pan. Most of all, I love the way it sits on my glasstop stove. Very easy to clean as well."
"Heats even, cleans up easily, the only reason I gave it only 4 stars for durability is that I’ve only been cooking with it for a couple weeks. I think the negative reviews are the result of not reading and following the instructions. Rapid or high heat isn’t good for any pan, but especially damaging to these finishes. Gradually bring up the heat and you won’t be disappointed in the performance or the durability!"
"I LOVE this pan! I have some 3yr old nonstick RR pans that are dented, scratched, and ready for the thrift store - and I have a huge cast iron pan… this one is now my “go to” for everything! I make eggs; rice; soup; pasta/sauce; I make everything in it!! Easy ti clean, feels sturdy, heats evenly! And to top it off? It’s beautiful!!"
"This pan is big enough to cook a full meal in, with nice high sides. Pancakes cook nice and evenly and nothing sticks at all. It cleans up really easily too. Great purchase!"
"I love the fast, even heat distribution. It’s very durable. So easy to use! Totally non-stick with everything I’ve used it for, and it’s used daily! It cleans up extremely fast & easy (once cooled). Caution: it cooks everything on low or med. Do not try to wash when still hot."
Beautiful piece. Hated to get it dirty but couldn’t wait to cook in it. Didn’t want cast iron on my cooktop. This cooks like cast iron but doesn’t scratch top.
"This is a perfect stove top Pan; it seems to be very durable. I would have uploaded pictures of it but I'd lost them using his stupid Amazon app. This app should have a foward button & it doesn't even offer you access to all your gallery photos! SMH -- But, buy this Pan, ""you won't regret it!!"""
"I love this skillet. Everything cooks evenly and it's deep which I love The lid had a wood handle that is easy to grip and stays cool to the touch All in all it's a great. I haven't had it long enough to know about the durability, I haven't used it long enough. So far so good."
"This pan is awesome, we used it for almost everything! Nice wide, deep space inside. I love the lid. Nonstick quality is good. We don't need to scrub it after cooking, a good rinse with hot water usually cleans it all up."
I purchased this pan as I needed a deep pan to mix chorizo and eggs and sloppy joes as I had been losing food over the side of the pan. This pan resolved all of that! Very easy to clean and the wooden handle remained cool.
"Not too heavy. Did great job (no stick) when cooking. Like the looks of the skillet--wood handle, wood lid knob, speckled finish. Looks to be a quality product--hopefully holds up over time. Read instructions and how to care for."
"This is IT! I have a collection of skillets.....some very expensive and have been unhappy with all. That is until this one. I am extremely pleased with everything about this pan. It is the right size, has a pour spout, glass lid, heats evenly and is super easy to clean. I highly recommend it to all."
"This pan is in constant rotation in my kitchen. It's non-stick, easy to clean and big enough to cook dinner for 4 easily. Great for any recipe where you need to make a sauce. Works well on my flat top electric range."
"I am enjoying it so far. It cleans up nicely. My only problem is that I am an older person and it is almost too heavy for me. As soon as I use it, I do clean it after it cools off and I have seen no scratches or marks on it."
Been trying to find a replacement for old Teflon coated 10” pan. This looked to be a good bet and has proven to be very nice. Not sure about the handle and lid handle - they are plastic/polypropylene. They don’t get hot but I don’t know how durable they will be
It is sturdy..heavy enough..well made I think..cooks well remember to start out low temp and don't cook on high or even med high it will get hot enough to chop up your veg s and by the time you prepare something else it will already be cooking!
"I needed a new pan to cook in with a lid. I like that this one is light yet the metal is thick. The handle is very comfortable. It’s very easy to clean. It is shipped without the handle attached, but they send you a full sized screwdriver with the pan to attach the handle. That was an added bonus for me."
Shipping was fast. The pan is great. Just what I wanted. I made a big stir-fry tonight and nothing burned or got stuck. This was a trial pan to see how I liked it. Passed with flying colors. Will buy more pans of other sizes from this company.
I have these pans in 5 different sizes now and absolutely love them. They heat up quickly and hold heat evenly. Super easy to clean up and so far have been quite durable. Definitely recommend!
I love this pan!!! I wish I had ordered the bigger size but I likely will. So easy to clean! Only bummer is that it isn’t fully oven safe. I love the pour option built in to the pan too!
Love this pan. It is the perfect size to cook hamburgers or Lima beans. Very versatile pan. The nonstick surface is awesome. I bought three other pans in different sizes because I liked this pan so much.
"I actually really like this product that I ordered more from this company/brand. I just wish there other products came with lids the way this one does, but overall really great! True non stick!"
It’s an excellent investment. Easy to clean. No issues so far. Love it. A family friendly size. This is my second one. A gift for my daughter in law. She likes it.
"This pan is amazing. Nothing sticks. Everything we've cooked so far has been cooked perfectly. Clean up is like super easy. Literally, we use a paper towel and everything just wipes out. I bought one for my son for Christmas and one for my daughter and they both love them!"
"Bought to use camping and replace other pans. Threw away all other ones after using this one. It's deep so what you're cooking stays in the pan, easy to drain water and grease from pan with no mess."
"Completely in love with these pans I ordered the rest of the set of pots to go with them . Thick heavy , easy to clean. Completely impressed!"
So far so good! It truly is non stick which with some pans is a fib! Lol but this one is super easy to clean and no food sticks! Only thing I can say I don’t like is that it’s not dishwasher safe but that’s ok!
"I believe in giving credit where credit is due. I'm immensely pleased with this purchase. I have cooked twice with this pan and was very happy with the outcome. I used medium heat and my food came out the way I wanted. Clean up was easy! I used warm water and just a tad of detergent on a sponge and walls, it was clean! I highly recommend this product!"
"This was my first and now I have two. After using the big pan, I was so happy with every thing about how it performed, I had to get the small one to go with it. They will help to make you a better cook."
So far I really like this pan. I have not used it a lot yet but what little I have used it I am impressed. Considering purchasing another in the next size larger.
I believe this is the best pan that I have ever owned. No sticking at all! And the wood handle is so nice looking. Got this one on sale and will be buying more.
I love this pan. It is one of the best I have ever used. The quality is great. Not heavy. Will order more from this manufacturer.
Pan is not too heavy but is good for frying meats. Keep cool handle. Not too pricey and would recommend to others who need a deep frying pan. I use it all the time.
The best pan in the world. It cooks everything perfectly. I’ve gone through so many pans only to find this one. Worth the price.
"I have finally found a frying pan I love. Moving away from non stick to ceramic, I was always somewhat dissatisfied. This pan is something different and works perfectly. 100% non stick and easy to clean. Love the depth for larger recipes. The glass lid is a plus and the wooden like knob and handle are a nice touch."
Wood-like pan handle and lid nob really elevate the cool look of this speckled finish cook ware. Heats perfectly and super easy clean up. Love it!
"They look great, heat very well, and are awesome for easy clean up. Replaced all of my other pans with this brand"
Very easy to clean and durable. I wrap foil around the handle and place in oven when making omelets. It is a pretty pan.
I absolutely love this skillet. The high sides are just right for anything you might cook. The food looks wonderful and it cleans up beautifully
"We wanted a particular width and depth plus all the easy to clean, good heat distribution and easy to handle. All great!"
"Great deep pan, love the clear lid. Cooks great, nonstick and cleans easily. Heat evenly distributed."
I love the look of this pan and it is perfect for making a meal. Seems to cook evenly with minimal sticking and the handle stays nice and cool to the touch. It is also super easy to clean. Very much worth the price.
I would recommend this pan to anyone. It is easy to clean as it is easy to cook with. Things will not stick in it and all cleanup is easy.
"no sure about longevity, but my first impression of this pan is great. nice thick flat bottom and easy to clean"
Ordered this to use with a two burner induction cooktop during remodel. It’s conducts heat well. Cleans easily and a wonderful addition. Have loved cooking with it.
This pan was purchased because we were so pleased with the larger pan of the same brand. They are the best that we have ever had!
Solid construction. A dream to cook with. Quick and easy to clean. The pouring/draining spout lip is a nice touch.
It is well made. It comes with the handle not attached. It is easy to attach the handle to the pan with the screw and screw driver that also comes in the package.
"I enjoyed the pan and it worked well. It’s more of a Dutch oven than a frying pan, but still nice."
"We first took a chance abd bought the skillet March 2. We liked it so much we bought another one the end of March. I waited to do a review and will say this skillet lives up to all the expectations. Heats evenly, nothing sticks to it, and clean up is a breeze. After trying other non stick products I highly recommend this one."
"I have three different Sensarte pans/skillets and use them almost daily. They are very sturdy and well made, and evenly distributes the heat while cooking on my glass-top range. Their customer service is impeccable, as well. Excellent products."
"It’s a $15 frying pan, honestly, I can’t complain. I needed a pan when I first moved out, and this fit the bill. I never learned how to cook, so this little pan saw some tears, burnt bacon, and stuck on who knows what. It’s been 9 months, and honestly—I’m a better cook now. I’ve learned to love my pans, and finally got a set that I won’t abuse. This pan did everything I needed, and worked for a first time cook. Did it scratch? Yes. Does it look new? No. It’s a frying pan, it adds flavor."
"I've had this for a couple months now, and it's been terrific. My old pan had become an ""everything sticks"" pan, and cleaning it after cooking just about anything was a huge pain. Nothing sticks to this one, and you can clean it after each use in seconds.  I can't speak to how well it would perform for serious culinary work, but for a home cook who just needs a good frying pan for everyday cooking, this is amazing for the price."
"Honestly this pan is amazing. for 8 bucks too, this is a steal. the non-stick doesn't scratch easily, and it indeed is non-stick. Great weight and handle. I think a lot of times people over think what cooking ware they need to get, like it needs to be expensive (like buying a kitchenAid product...ugh such a waste of money), when actually things like this are fabulous too."
"Before I purchased this frying pan I was restricted to cold meals or microwaveable products that were probably poisonous. Even if I wanted to cook, my skills at cookery were utterly atrocious, if not diabolical. In short, I cooked worse than any line cook at a Buffalo Wild Wings.  After I purchased this frying pan, I became a Michelin Star Chef. I could fry up dishes that would make Gordon Ramsay taciturn. Guy Fieri would gladly buy a first class ticket to flavor town if he could take even the smallest bite of one the dishes I was creating.  This frying pan changed my life. I found love on Match.com without even posting a photo of my face, I just took a photo of my food.  Tony Robbins and Gary Vee swear by this frying pan. This combined with cold showers at 5am will make you an instant billionaire. This is the secret that Rhonda Byrne still won’t shut up about.  Buy yours now! You will not regret it! Operators are standing by!"
Love how heavy it is. Feels durable. Thick bottom. Heat distributes evenly. Everything from eggs to salmon slide right out of the pan. Make sure you get silicone cooking utentils to cook with.
"I read some reviewers said nothing sticks to this, so I was under the impression I could make scrambled eggs but it sticks. of course that is remedied by adding a little butter or little oil first. but I was under the impression it would not stick without those things, so I was just slightly disappointed because so far it functions just like any other$12 frying pan I could buy it at a local store, but this is well-built and sturdy and everything about it feels high quality my only complaint is unless you use cooking oil or butter or something things can stick to it"
"You simply cannot go wrong with this Utopia pan, for the money; sure, there are others out there that cost 3-4 times as much, but none of those products (I've bought a number the high ends), will out perform this pan. It cooks even, for edge to edge, non stick is superb, cleans up very easily and has performed flawlessly, with daily use now for over 8 months. As with all nonstick pans, be careful not to use anything but nonstick utensils and be careful not to stack in dishwasher or dry rack, with nonstick side touching metal of abrasive objects; with those things in mind, you will not go wrong with the performance of this Utopia pan."
Cheap price. But rubbed out after one year. Cheap enough to buy again but I can't say product is high quality.
This was the best Nonstick Frying Pan for its reasonable price that I have ever purchased. I am complete satisfied and would recommend this pan to anyone looking for a good nonstick pan.
"This is a great pan. The photo shows the surface condition after 7 months of daily use. (Small amount of scratching visible but performance is the same as the first day I used it.) I am impressed with the durability and am ordering a 2nd (I always keep 2 non-stick skillets on hand.) I've used T-Fal skillets since 2012 and used to be quite pleased with their quality, but that quality has diminished in the last few years and I threw my last T-Fal away and this is a better replacement for half the price."
"I really like this pan; In fact, when we got a new set of pots and pans, I kept this one and got rid of everything else. However, I had been noticing a plastic-y film on my glass stovetop every once in a while and couldnt figure out where it was coming from. Apparently, something has peeled off the bottom of this pan and is transferring to the cooktop (looks like a ring from the pan bottom). Im using easy off to try to clean off the bottom and see if thay resolves the problem. But, user beware."
"It's a pan. How much is there to say? Actually, if there's a stand-out feature to it, that would be that the handle was attached correctly. The pan I was replacing (different brand) would let water into the handle at the rivets while in the dish washer and then leak out onto the range top the next time I cooked with it. This one is solidly constructed, no water problems."
Ordered this pan after reading the positive reviews. Never expected it to be so nice! Not at all flimsy and the handle does not get hot. It looks like a much more expensive pan and i am very happy with it.
"I have started using induction cooking more and more, but I don't have a lot of induction cookware. I needed a non-stick pan, so I ordered this one. Very nice pan. It is not cheaply made, it has some weight to it and chances are good that it will last awhile. If you're looking for a non-stick, induction frying pan, this one would be a good choice."
"I wanted to wait a few months before writing a review because I have been burned (figuratively, of course!) by “nonstick” pans. You know the kind....on tv they put a slice of cheese in the thing and twirl it around like it’s floating on air. Those always left me wondering what I was doing wrong. Well, four months later and nothings sticking!  I have treated this one like I was probably supposed to have with the other ones...wash it out with only soft things, like a paper towel or sponge. And no metal spatulas. Don’t need them because nothing sticks anyway. Well worth what we paid for it. Would buy again but don’t need to because, as you know, nothing has stuck! Ta Da!"
Excellent non-stick pan! Very easy to clean. The handle does transfer a small amount of heat through the plastic so be careful of that. Aside from this there are no issues!  Also the pan is deep enough for most dishes but if you like to have a fuller/more robust dish with tons of vegetables simmering and marinating then you'll need something deeper than this. I recently cooked a meatball soup (it was portioned for 2 people so I didn't use a standard pot) and all of the ingredients barely fit. Something to keep in mind!
"I first bought a Utopia sauce pan. Nothing stuck to that thing. Cleaning anything was a breeze. So then I decided to buy this frying pan. Same great experience.  Just bought these products, so not sure how long they will last. But so far they work great, and do seem sturdier than other non-stick products I've bought in the past that ended up peeling and having to be disposed of prematurely."
"Bought this as secondary pan for my cast iron. Its used mostly for light duty, like over easy eggs or grilled cheese when the other pan is in use. With light use and non-metal utensils this pan has held up very well and has not lost its anti stick properties since purchase."
"My wife bought a pan at a home and garden show that cost significantly more and was worthless a few month later. So I said why not try one from amazon. Well this pan has performed flawlessly never sticking without the use of oils or non stitch aerosol. One year later and still my go to pan. Her 150$ pan, we donated it and hope no one is cursing us."
This frying pan is great! It was only about 16.00 but it doesn’t stick!!!!!!!I think so far We have it for 2 months!!It doesn’t stick!!!Its worth the money!!!!!!
"The first thing I made in this pan were some scrambled eggs to test the nonstick abilities. I was blown away at the results. All remains wiped off with a single swipe of a dry paper towel, and the eggs came out great. I have used this pan several times by now and have noticed no wearing down of the nonstick coating. I bought this pan after getting so frustrated at my Blue Diamond ""nonstick"" pan that I threw it straight from the stovetop into the trash. After quickly purchasing this pan afterwards, I can easily say that was a great decision."
"I first purchased this pan in September of 2018. And it’s lasted me a year and a half! It’s April of 2020, and I’m back for more! It lasted a long time - and I use this pan every, single day - multiple times a day! I’m ordering a couple more, and definitely recommend this pan!"
I love this pan. I use it almost every day. It cleans easily and is nice and flat on the bottom (which is good for my glass cooktop). I try to hand wash as much as possible—rather than using the dishwasher. It’s been probably about 4-5 months so far and I would buy this brand again.
"My previous 10"" pan was small on the induction plate. This pan fits nicely and seems to cook faster, probably because the bottom plate is better matched to the induction coil. Coating is holding up well after 1 month, but time will tell. Last pan lasted 10 years of careful use. I wish I had ordered a lid with it."
"Only thing I dislike is the fact they wear out. All Teflon pans wear out in about 1 year from my everyday use, this pan seems to last longer then others I've used though and will be the next I buy too. Love it!"
I wanted a T Fal but couldn't justify that much money.  This pan has held up very well and is an excellent value.  It's a little heavier than T Fal but not enough to be a deal breaker.  Would buy again.
"For the price, and even when compared to non-stick frying pans double the price, this pan delivers! We've had this pan for 2 years in March 2020 and it's still going strong with almost daily use. Sure the non-stick surface isn't what it was when we bought it, but it's still non-stick. Others that we've had never made it a year and that goes for T-Fal brand as well. You need to clean these pans right after use and dry them immediately as well - as with all non-stick. You won't be disappointed!"
"I am so pleasantly surprised by this pan. My previous non stick pan had ceased to be non stick quite a long time ago and I was sick of having to soak it and then scrub for ages to get it clean. This pan was lightweight, easy to use, cooked items evenly, and was a breeze to clean up."
I am incredibly happy with this Frying Pan. The nonstick surface is excellent and it has proved to be durable so far. I am sure I have already good 150 meals in it.  It gets hand washed and air dried after every use and never goes in teh dish washer. So far it is pristine with good care. And I almost never use even a tiny spray of oil.
I’ve designated this pan for eggs only and so far it’s been great! Cooks them perfectly and doesn’t stick. I still coat it with oil so I’m not sure if it’s a miracle pan but it works great if used right. Awesome price too.
"We are using it to fry eggs, does a good job of doing so without any oil. The pan is heavy and well balanced and the handle is strong and sturdy."
"I recently received my Utopia 11 inch nonstick frying pan, and I was impressed by how well-made it was. It's very sturdy, the handle is riveted onto the pan instead of screwed on like most of the pans I have (all have, over time come unscrewed) and the bottom induction system makes the food cook very evenly. I highly recommend this pan!"
"So far so good with this pan. I needed a new nonstick pan for eggs, etc, and this one has been great so far. Hopefully it holds up well, as I really like how it cooks and heats up. I use a gas stove. Pan heats up quickly and it seems to have even heat across the cooking surface."
Loved it. Very sturdy yet light weight. Easy to clean as it is nonstick. Durability? Not sure. It got scratched when someone used a metal utensil on it and will probably have to throw it out in a year or so.
I just received my new pan. It works very well. Have used it several times and everything slides off like it's supposed to. I am treating it gently by not exposing it to extreme temperatures or temperature changes and don't use metal utensils. I hope it will last a while. Thank you!
"I bought this to use with a Duxtop Portable Induction Cooktop, Countertop Burner, Induction Burner with Timer and Sensor Touch, 1800W 8500ST E210C2.  However, when I first tried to use it, the Duxtop flashed code ""E0"" which the manual says means that the pan isn't compatible with induction cooktops.  UPDATE: the burner was broken, not the pan."
"Ordered this to use with an induction plate. Have not used it yet, but sure it will be fine. Seems to be good quality."
"The whole family loves using this new pan. Eggs, veggies, sauces - we use it every day, multiple times a day. It cleans off completely simply by running it under water most of the time."
This pan is exactly what I needed. It is lightweight and easy to clean. Note that I typically apply a generous squirt of olive oil to nearly everything before cooking to help protect the pan. I've been using it frequently for several months and love it.
"Best frying pan in my cupboard. I can’t speak to its durability at this point, as I haven’t had it long enough, but, after 10 or more uses, it looks as good as when I opened its box."
"Excellent pan with an even better price. I was skeptical about the price, but the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. Pan is thick and heavy. Feels much better quality than inexpensive pans that you would find in the big box stores. Holds up to high heat and heats nice and evenly. I would and probably will buy again."
"non stick don't last forever, so its always good to get a cheaper one, and this one is great. First one lasted about a year."
"So far, this pan has been great for sautéing foods, etc. I do still have to use a little oil but not much. I love how easy this pan is to clean."
"I have used this pan for several months, this pan is very good, cheap, but works very well. The only problem is that they do not provide a cover, you need to buy another pan cover if you need."
"I'm the cook in the house and have gone through a lot of ""non-stick"" pans which have disappointed me time after time. , I buy this low cost pan, and eggs just slide around like they are slick on ice. Amazing! But, I've only used it this first time. See what happens with age. Hope it stays this way!!!"
"Pretty good, for a cheap pan. I bought a # of induction-ready pans when I bought my new induction range, which I LOVE. Too early to tell about this one's durability, but so far, so good."
"Was tired of my old, worn pan. Got this as a replacement and am very pleased! It cleans easily."
"My last frying pan was a joke and not an especially amusing one. Everything stuck to it, well, it was gross. So far I've used this about seven times and it's great - nothing sticks, easy/breezy to clean, and I'm very happy with it."
"After getting very frustrated with huge differences in price and varied reviews on almost every pan, I opted for a cheap, basic pan. It works so well! Have had it about a month or so and we use 4 to 5 times a week. It definitely is non-stick and works like a dream. We allow it to cool before washing and hand wash and towel dry immediately. I suspect this will last longer than I anticipated and so glad I did not buy a very expense pan now."
I just ordered another exactly like this. This is exa6what I was looking for and was concerned about the quality because of the excellent price but I'm very pleased!
"I use this skillet at least once or twice a week. I love it! The mail thing you should know if you purchase it is that you are not supposed to use higher than medium heat or the teflon can come off. I have to adjust some recipes that call for Medium high heat and cook them a little longer, but the ease of clean-up is worth it to me."
"This is such an amazing pan, not too big, not too small and super easy to clean. I’d recommend buying more than one. You can’t beat the price!"
"I've never found a non stick pan that will last a lifetime, it just doesn't exist. Buy this, use for 2 years or so, replace. For the price, it's perfect, nice size, great non stick, and when it's lived it's life, you toss and don't feel the least bit bad."
"Great price, and works very well as a nonstick pan! Have used it for many different types of food and has held up amazingly well!"
"I’ve only used once, so can’t rate durability. Works great and just wiped out and stored away when finished. Cooks evenly, which I haven’t found in other frying pans that say good for induction cooking."
Great for every day use. I would suggest a matching glass cover and it would be the perfect purchase for an induction cooker
"The ""Utopia"" Kitchen 11 Inch Nonstick Frying Pan is Great! ""Easy to Clean"", ""Light Weight"", ""Durability"" and a very good Price!"
"Easy to clean and lightweight. Overall happy with the pan. It makes food go from ""I can make you sick for being raw"" to ""This is well cooked. Good job ole sport""."
"Works great on my induction top, nonstick coating is holding up nicely. Wish it had a lid, but you get what you pay for I guess"
I was surprised at the quality of this fry pan. The non-stick coating somehow seems harder than others I've owned and worn out. I would recommend this fry pan.
This was worth the money. So far nothing sticks and super easy to clean. Always use a plastic spatula.
"Replaced my older (worn out, and more expensive) nonstick pan with this one, and am happy so far. The nonstick coating seems to stay on pretty well - haven't noticed any scratches yet. Good side for scrambling a few eggs, or searing some fish/steaks for 2."
I bought this on a whim when my tfal pan’s handle broke. This wipes the floor with tfal. Cheap price. Outstanding quality. My food has never been cooked better. Surprising for a no name brand frying pan. I’d buy the whole collection if I didn’t already have tfal stocked in my cabinet.
Nice size pan just when I need nonstick
Perfect size and weight for medium size jobs - party of one your dinner is ready !!!
first one I received was horribly bent. I requested an exchange and the 2nd one was fine. good pan
"The frying pan I'm replacing, and the ones I'll be replacing in the near future, are all small in the inside. By that, I mean that my old pans have ""curved"" sides which take away from the floor of the pan. This one has substantially less curvature which increases the cooking surface."
"I bought this after burning my hand for the nth time on an Ikea frying pan handle. The insulated handle is great. Also, no need to constantly play with screws on the handle coming loose. Hope to use this for a long time."
"This is a perfect and sturdy medium sized pan perfect for grilled cheese and eggs, bacon too. It is so easy to clean and oven proof it says! I haven't tried it in the oven yet."
"Good, inexpensive pan. Arrived promptly."
"I know from experience that you have to replace your non-stick pans every coupla-few years, because they lose their non-stick quality with use. So, you can either go all-out and get the most expensive non-stick pans on the market, or get a good value for your money. This is a good value for your money.  Despite the non-stick surface, you really need to use some kind of fat to have these pans (and any non-stick pans, really) truly be non-stick. Butter is good if you want that flavor (especially with eggs), as is any high smokepoint oil (I prefer grapeseed oil).  Out of the box, I tested this pan with an egg and no fat on the pan (after washing with warm water, soap, and a sponge). It was almost non-stick, but not quite. Which is what I expected.  If you want your non-stick pans to last: - Do not sear anything (on high heat) - Do not put them into the dishwasher (despite the claim that they're dishwasher-safe) - anything you put in the dishwasher, you're basically sandblasting - Wash with hot water, dishwashing soap, and a sponge (no scrubby pads or dish brushes) - Never use non-stick cooking spray. They contain lecithin, which builds up into a brown goo that you can't remove without destroying the cooking surface. - Only use nylon or silicone utensils (you can make a heck of an omelet with a silicone spatula) - Do not stack them without some kind of protection on the cooking surface (newspaper?). I hang all of my pans on a pot rack, which is preferable.  Follow these rules, and you should get at least a couple of good years use (maybe more) out of your pans. But, plan on buying new ones in a coupla-few years. If you want to cook on high heat and/or sear stuff, consider a good stainless (All-Clad?) or cast iron (Lodge?) pan. Just don't torture your non-stick pans. It's not what they're made for."
"I purchased this pan for the first time about a year ago. The quality of the pan is great, especially since we don’t handle it with extra care (we use metal fork etc.). However, as other review mentions its base is not wide enough so it is not stable on our range. But it is my husband’s fav pan, so when time came to replace an older frying pan, I purchased this pan again. This time can a pan white a wider base, and it no longer wobble on the range. I was so pleased that OXO fixed the design problem, so I bought another one, thinking to replace the older model, that is basically a fire hazard. Unfortunately this time came the smaller base pan again, so I sent it back. I did notice that at the bottom of the pan there is a model number, and it was different. It was 4198 for the older model and 6198 for the improved model. The actual base is about 0.5” wider, which is a big difference. If the pan doesn’t wobble on your range, then it’s a solid pan that would last. I just wish I could buy another pan from the wider (newer?) model."
"I read the reviews that mentioned the problem of the pan tipping when empty because the handle was too heavy, and another review that stated that the design problem had been rectified. I like the other pans I have in this line and wanted the smaller one, so I contacted the seller, Chefs Corner Store to inquire about the pan. I got a fast response, with the seller having opened the packaging on a pan to test it for tipping. Since the report was that the pan does not tip, I went ahead and placed the order. The pan is great! I live alone, so cooking up an egg or two, or whipping up a bit of stir-fry is just right in this 8"" pan. Super easy clean-up, too - just wipe it out. Even cheese doesn't stick to it. Highly recommend the pan and the seller!"
"This is the first truly non-stick pan that I've owned. The blue pan and the copper pan have all lost their non-stick coating. Here's the rub - In order to keep this pan from sticking, 1. Do not stack it underneath other pans 2. Wait until it cools before washing or it will warp. Also, do not use abrasive pads or cleaners. 3. Use rubber utensils not metal. 4. Salt food after you place it off the skillet or it might scratch. If you follow this advice, your pan will keep its non-stick coating indefinitely. I've had mine for months and it still looks brand new."
"I've never owned a non-stick pot or pan because of all the warnings. But, lately especially, some of the recipes I want to make specifically indicate using a non-stick pan. I have a 6"" pan which is good for making a couple eggs but can't handle anything more. I have a 10"" pan too but that's often too big. So I needed an inbetween so got this one. It really is non-stick (surprise!) which is really nice. I am following the recommendations on the little paper that came with it so I hope it'll be nice to me for a long time. I don't want to get any other non-stick pots or pan but this one is a good one. It does have a way of tipping off the burner grill when empty since the handle weighs more than the pan) but other than that it seems perfect. Oxo, fix the handle! You could have put a hollow core handle on there and it would be a near perfect pan for just basic home cooks.  01-2020 update--have been using this now for a month or so and find the tip factor horrible and am now looking for some other non-stick teflon pan. I don't need piping hot juices or oils spilling all over the place, not to even mention the chance of fire. This is just an unacceptable pan just because they didn't balance the handle with the rest of the pan."
"At last, a square griddle pan with some substance to it. Someone had a conscious thought when they designed this pan. I have run through SO many of these, and have had to throw away most as soon as they begin to warp. I always seem to wind up in an apartment that has a glass top stove (grrrrr, HATE them) but this pan works beautifully with it. It is weighty, but not such that you can't lift it. It feels substantial in the hand, and lays perfectly flat on that cursed glass top. If you (and this is key) FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, you'll have this pan a long time. Use low to medium heat, as the heat is conducted quickly and evenly. Do NOT put it in the dishwasher--there's no need to. A quick swish with hot soapy water does the job. If you're scraping food off this, your heat is too high. The price for this is quite reasonable, especially since I've paid for it six times over at least with cheap ones (which were the only ones I could find at the time). I love this for sandwiches, searing steaks, French toast, eggs, pancakes, etc.. This is 11"" square, so 4 pieces of regular sandwich bread will fit nicely here, and clean up is a breeze. LOVE IT!"
"My dad loves to cook, and he also loves to research all of his cooking tools before buying them. I got him this because he mentioned he needed a new non-stick pan for eggs. Cook's Country recommended the OXO pans. He likes the metal handles, so I got him the Pro version. He also generally only needs the 10 inch pan, so I went with it over the 12 inch. He loves it!! Says it is the best pan he has ever had. He really like the angle of the edges. It is a pretty steep side, almost like a corner, and it makes the bottom of the pan a lot flatter than pans that have an easy slope on the side. He says it gives him more room to work. I may purchase one for myself!"
"The pan performs well, however the non-stick surface is flaking off after less than a year’s use employing proper utensils. We expected better."
"Update:4/20 - Still no wear and I use I nearly daily...I like my eggs :) Also, never stack any non-stick pan; hang it on a hook as I can or protect the finish by putting it in a ziplock before nesting pans. Normally I wouldn't have expected this priced pan to last more than three months. With my normal routine, I can see this finish lasting more than a year. Amazing!  Great nonstick finish at a good price. I never use soap on my nonstick pans, just very hot water and a wipe out with a paper towel. Super easy cleanup, no sticking, better than expensive name brands all-clad. I have many all-clad pans, mostly Stainless as it just doesn't pay for a nontick pan...even with the care as outlined above, the finish will erode over time. So just get this oxo and when it finally does erode, just replace it. I haven't seen any wear yet on this pan and I use it often. Pleasantly surprised...."
"This item was very highly rated in a leading cooking magazine. One of its admirable qualities in the review was that the bonding of nonstick surface to base material was not going to delaminate. And sure enough, it was wonderful to cook in it. We were careful never to subject it to high heat, and we took good care of it.  About 1 year later, bubbles appeared on the cooking surface. And then the bubbles scraped off. It's now useless. We wrote to OXO to ask about their 10-year warranty and have had no reply. If we ever hear from them, I will revise this review."
"This has great heat distribution, and has kept the coating well. We have the 10"" and liked it so much that we got the 12"".  I cook on a very hot stove (16k BTU, but to be honest, I tend to have it on low or low-mid). It has only warped a little, and I just rotate it a tad to get it to lay flat. I've gotten the same mileage on the all-clad staneless and and Calphalon William Sanoma Elite Nonstick (I recommend both)  I only use wood, nylon, or oxo silicone spatulas. So I can't speak for what happens if you use a metal utensil.  Note about Calphalon - I only recommend the Elite - as the lower versions lost their coating quite quickly for me. OXO is much better than the T-fal series but comperable in price. T-fal lasted about 6 months before loosing the coating."
"Please do not buy this griddle, its extremely poorly made. Just got this OXO griddle delivered to me on Dec 05. With less than 10 days of use the griddle has already warped with ordinary use, that it is now unusable. Hugely disappointed at the OXO quality of this griddle. Not worth the money, only used 4 -5 times and it warped."
"This would be a five-star review if the nonstick finish hadn't degraded so quickly. The handle and weight are nice, the exterior finish is great. The only problem is the cooking surface. We have lots of nonstick skillets and treat them all the same way: no metal utensils, hand-wash only. This one has started flaking much more quickly than the other brands. It's already time to replace this one, and we certainly won't be buying another of this model."
"After one year of use the coating has holes in some places. Also it had dimples on the pan. When I reached out to Oxo customer support (initially about the dimpling) they claimed that it was carbonization on the pan. I followed their cleaning directions and it made it slightly better but still had a lot of ""carbonization"" on it.  About a month after first contacting Oxo customer support I noticed that there is now a hole in the coating. They stated that it isn't a hole but burnt oil. I have attached a photo here showing the hole and disagree that it is burnt oil.  As a note I never use any metal utensils in the pan. I use a Matfer Pelton Spatula and an old silicon spatula (with plastic handle) in it. Along with OXO Tongs with Nylon Heads. Also we only use butter, olive oil, or avocado oil. We have never used any spray oils, as have read that they are bad for non-stick pans."
"Great value. Received the pan. It is everything I expected and more. I would even compare this to some of the high dollar pans I have had. (Mother-in-law lived with us for a short time, warped my high-end flat pan and destroyed our other cookware) this pan, like all pans, you have to find out how it cooks. Do not set this pan on high heat like u did with your old one you WILL warp it. I recommend starting out on low heat, and cooking an omelet watching the heat signature of the pan. My old pan I could cook at a number 4 heat setting. (We have a gas stove) with this pan I am cooking at a 2 1/2 - 3 heat setting. It makes the best omelets and pancakes. Clean up is a snap. Pan must be cool before cleaning. Cleans with a paper towel. Pan works wonders without using non-stick sprays like PAM, butter, margarine or oils. I expect to use this pan for a long time. Great product."
"We are now on our second pan as the first one was scratched to the heavens the first night it arrived. We literally used it just to heat a couple corn tortillas and all we did was place them in the pan on one side for about 30-45 seconds then flipped to the other side and did the same. In sliding these around the pan GENTLY, mind you, when we removed the tortillas low and behold there were scratches all over the surface. At first we couldn't believe our eyes and said there's no way, so we waited for the pan to cool to room temp and proceeded to wash it with a NON-Abrasive sponge but to our dismay those wretched scratches were still there. Definitely not a nice sight after ONE use and seeing as how we paid almost $50.00 for this pan!! So we returned this as defective because we believe we did nothing wrong. We didn't even use a utensil, we flipped them by hand.  Well the return was accepted and we opted for a replacement of the same pan thinking this was a fluke and maybe something was just wrong with THAT pan. We received our replacement about a week later and we used it to cook eggs, etc. and everything was great UNTIL over the weekend we used it to cook pupusas. Now mind you, pupusas are made with a SOFT masa dough. All we did was heat a little oil in the pan and cooked them on each side until crispy on the outside but still nowhere near what you would think it would take to SCRATCH a pan. Unbelievable. We removed the food when it was done and you guessed it, scratches galore. This time deeper, you could feel the ridge with your finger when you ran it over the scratch and also the finish (non-stick coating) was already coming off in the middle. Ya'll this pan was only ever heated to medium and not ever used on high heat. It just wasn't needed as medium did the job pretty well and honestly that's the setting we use mostly as in learning about proper cooking we found out it can warp some pans, etc. if it is heated too high.  Overall we are sending this second pan back as well, this time for a full refund. We are highly disappointed in this OXO Pan and will GLADLY be taking our money elsewhere. Such a shame because when the pan arrives it is so beautifully packaged and the shine and shimmer on that pan is so elegant and when you look at it, it looks like a nice professional pan, but how is this worth anything when you have to fear it scratching like this?!? I could understand if we were using metal utensils/trying to cook something rough but never expected the turnout we had. Hope this helps others and best of luck if you buy this pan. Apparently it's particular on what you can and can't cook in it."
"I saw this pan reviewed on America’s Test Kitchen, which is my go-to for all of my kitchen equipment. I’ve never had anything fall short of excellent from them; They test for everything! So I was very curious to see if this pan indeed did not balance when I got it, As some reviews have stated. Attached are three pictures. My cooktop is often very unstable because of the design of all the prongs. I move this around all over the cooktop, and it did not tip over once. I knew that America’s test kitchen test for things like this… Ease-of-use, balance, so I am not sure if somebody reviewed the wrong pan? This is a winner! I love that it is dishwasher safe and I love that the rivets are coated on the inside! I will update the review after I use it a lot more… But it does not tip on top of the stove!"
"Non stick has come a long way. I have 3 sizes of these. the are good for heating, clean out easily, I use a paper towel soon after cooking for visible stuff and wash later, and last for a long time. And they are a great price. Cook's Magazine said a few years ago, ""Don't buy expensive non-stick, just use and throw out in a year or 2. Not bad but these last and are worth the low price."
"I knew when I purchased this pan that it did not come with a lid. I did not realize that standard 10"" lids will not fit the pan. I have a lid from a previous 10"" frypan (not Oxo) that has fit multiple pans from multiple manufacturers. I was very disappointed to find that it does not fit the Oxo pan. Once I discovered that I searched the reviews and Q&A for ""lid"" and saw the complaints about lids not fitting. It never occurred to me that a pan from a major manufacturer like Oxo would not accept a standard lid so I did not check that before purchase. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"OXO has such a good reputation that I thought I would get their griddle. In spite of good care and handling, this griddle has warped and no longer fits on the stove well enough to cook anything. Owned less than a year. I sent OXO a letter three months ago and heard nothing.  Not recommended."
"Two yrs. ago, I purchased the 10-inch Oxo Pro pan. Today, it still looks and performs like brand new. I use it every day. Now, I purchased the same pan but smaller 8-inch. The Oxo Pro pans have a lifetime warranty. They will last a very long time if you don't use citrus-based soaps or products to clean them. It slowly eats away the non-stick coating. I found a cover lid for my 10-inch pan and another one for my 8-inch pan. Both lids are sold on Amazon. They are made of glass and silicone with a little metal ring surrounding the steam hole. The knob/handle on the smaller lid is silicone too. It looks like it was made for my Oxo pan. I'm very pleased with the high-quality details, performance, and maintenance of both Oxo pans and universal lids. I would happily buy them all again. Here's the Amazon link for the small glass lid in size ""6-7-8"":  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYF4WQW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1  Please note: The tiny white lines on the cover lid is dust. There are no defects or faults in the lid or pan itself. I didn't know the new iPhones will capture that much detail. Now I have to vacuum before taking photos too."
"I love these Oxo skillets. Like everything Oxo in the kitchen, they are well designed, comfortable, and perform very well. I keep them beside the Matfer carbon steel skillets for tasks that for which I am not confident enough to subject any nonstick pat. I also will remain careful enough to still not subject them to a dishwasher. Why take chances? But they are a breeze to clean, as nothing has remained stuck! Food glides around on the pan while cooking and it comes off after I am finished. My only complaint is they don't have lids available. No problem, though, because lids for my other skillets fit fine. Price was fine for all three pans. I gulped when I saw Amazon had raised the cost on the 12-inch skillet from $40 to over $90, but I jumped for joy when it came down again to $40. The skillets are very well constructed and designed. I appreciate the clever lip on the edge that is effective at reducing spills when I pour food from the pan. Oxo came through for me again. (I am not receiving any compensation from Oxo or Amazon. I am expressing my personal experience and enthusiasm.)"
"As with all nonstick cookware, I was extremely skeptical of the claims about this pan, but it really does deliver, unlike the dozen others I've tried over the past few years. I use a small amount of cooking oil in it most of the time, but I have found that doing so is not strictly necessary, even with naturally sticky foods like eggs. Preheated to an appropriate medium-to-medium-high temp, you can crack an egg into the pan and then flip it with ease, and *that* my friends is truly remarkable. I've tried other types of nonstick pans that make that claim and they have all failed. This is literally the first nonstick pan I've ever owned that is actually nonstick. And, it still accepts and distributes cooking oil evenly. Strongly recommended!  Two additional notes related to this pan: 1) I initially was using plastic-silicon turners/spatulas, one of which had become hard and brittle (eventually breaking). It did seem to leave superficial marks on the surface of the pan, but the pan still seems to perform just as well as new. I eventually replaced the old spatula with an OXO silicon spatula (small size is perfect for this pan) and that's been an awesome fit. 2) Cleaning is a breeze. Most nonstick pans will suggest not washing their pans with soap unless you're going a long time between uses. I have found that this pan actually performs better when you use a little soap to clean it up. ymmv."
"2019 update- the sides are starting to get a little sticky. No warping at all. Can't believe this pan has lasted 2 years with my regular use. Will purchase another soon.  Love love this pan. It has not warped or changed shape. I use it alot. My Tfal lasted a few weeks before it started warping and lost some of it's non stick properties. Not this sturdy guy, it looks brand new 4 months later. Don't hesitate, buy this pan."
"After several weeks of use I find this OXO pan to be superior to 4 other square griddle brands I tried. There has been no problems with anything sticking and so far there has been no signs of warping that has happened with the others. Possibly, because this is a much heavier pan. I am being extra careful with this pan by not using extreme heat and not washing a hot pan in cold water, which could cause warping. I recommend this and would purchase the same pan again without hesitation."
"After reading the reviews on this frying pan, I was concerned about the handle being 'too heavy' which may cause the pan to 'tip over'. However, since I'm usually very happy with the quality of other OXO products I've ordered, I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. This is an excellent frying pan! The sides are high, which prevents food from spilling over the edges and increases the interior capacity. The non-stick feature is great and it's easy to clean. Surprisingly, because of the depth of the frying pan, it seems larger than its size. Best of all, there was absolutely NO TIPPING OVER. Perhaps OXO improved this product, but the frying pan I received is perfect for our needs. Overall, once again, OXO products continue to be reliably consistent in their excellent quality. As far as durability, only time will tell."
"The 8 inch skillet is unusable as designed. Handle too heavy for the skillet. Tips over when resting on stove eye. Center of gravity on the 10 inch and 12 inch skillet more balanced. You won't have the same problem with the larger skillets. Also the cooking surface on the 8 inch pan is slightly more than 5.5 inches, enough for 1 egg, maybe 2. Overall nice pans if you omit the 8 inch size and stick with the larger sizes."
"It is truly sad that as a professional chef of over forty years, my pans at home were very old, in abysmal condition and of poor quality. Even sadder, they had seen very little usage over the course of the last 25 years. After loudly voicing my opinion on the piece of cookware I was using, my wife said why don't you just buy another pan. I was expecting to return this pan but I was pleasantly surprised! It has the right heft and feels solid. It is not heavy and clunky nor does it seem cheap and tinny both are issues I constantly see in cookware for the home. The handle is the right length and fits well in the hand. Even more more important the inside edge of pan is right height and roll for flipping food! I can flip an over easy egg with a flick of the wrist. Most of the pans I see are too square or too short. I can also go from stove top to oven in this same pan and that is like icing on the cake. I liked this pan so much I purchased a 10"" one as well. Kudos to OXO! Now can we talk about a lid to fit??"
"I use this quite a bit -- it is my go-to sear and sauté pan. I often will sear fish or chicken on stovetop and finish it in the oven. I will also use this in place of the wok due to ease of size. It heats up/cools down quickly so I find it easy to control the temperature when cooking. I bought this a little over a year ago (August 2020) and it is still going strong. I use a ceramic cook-top. It was recommended by America's test kitchen. My daughter is shopping for a pan. When I sent her this recommendation I noticed a few reviews that did not like the pan so I just thought I would share my experience. Not sure it would do well over a flame, but over the ceramic it is great! I have an expensive set of thick copper bottom pans, and this is the one I reach for the most. Just make sure you remember to grab that pot holder when taking it out of the oven!!!"
"I had previously bought a cheap griddle pan from Amazon (one of those copper colored things) that warped badly after only a couple of uses making pancakes. Frankly, I'd bought it as an experiment to see if a super cheap pan would be OK. Well, now I know that it is possible to go too cheap :-)  After a considerable amount of research, and reading reviews on pans at every price point, I decided to go with this OXO pan. By and large, the reviews on this pan are favorable, and of course OXO is a well known brand, so I pulled the trigger and bought one.  As soon as I unboxed it, I compared this pan to my old, warped one. The OXO is a good 3mm thicker than the old pan, and its handle is nicer to hold and feels securely attached to the base. We have used it several times, and so far there are no signs of warping. The non-stick coating works as claimed and is easy to clean.  I'm happy with my OXO pan and think you will be, too. It's a solid pan at a good price. As long as you don't abuse it (avoid high heat, use silicone utensils, and DO NOT USE COOKING SPRAY) it should last a long time."
Purchased in December 2019. Never left the pan unattended or used on a high flame. The nonstick coating is great but the bottom of the pan is melting away. I've been buying cookware for 50 years and have never seen this happen.  I contacted OXO through their online claim form and got an immediate reply with a reference number. The reply said they would contact me within 24 hours. That was two weeks ago. I called their toll free number but hung up after 30 minutes on hold. Amazon has not replied to my request for assistance.
I bought this because America's Test Kitchen said that it was the best one. But after only a few uses and with no scraping of the pan with any metal utensil the surface of the skillet looks as if has been in service for 5 years. That is not acceptable. That cannot be the best skillet! There is no way...
"I've bought several nonstick skillets over the past ten years, including All-Clad. They usually work reasonably well for a few weeks and then begin to lose some of their nonstick quality. Even using plastic, wood or nylon utensils seems to scratch them some and finally after a year or more, they become ineffective, although still usable. After looking at a superlative recommendation on a cooking website, I bought this pan. It was a little more expensive than Farberware and other decent quality pans, but I figured I'd chance that it might pay off. Did it ever! Have been using it regularly for two months now and it is as slippery as day one. It's almost annoying how slippery it is as I have trouble flipping eggs in the morning-can't get under them without pushing them around. Anyway, it cleans easily with a soapy sponge, the surface has held up well and it is STILL nonstick. Will update over time, but so far, I'm loving this pan like no other. I'm a car guy, not a cook, so for me to get this excited over a frying pan is not normal. I just appreciate the quality and function of a GREAT product!"
"I really like this pan. I love to cook and good quality tools are important to me. This pan is lightweight and feels nicely balanced. I chose the Pro version for the slightly higher oven temp range in case I need to finish a dish there. Large cooking surface. Super easy clean up. I haven't put it in the dishwasher, but nice to know I can. I found a stray, glass Calphalon lid in a thrift store that fits it perfectly. I'll be buying a 10"" pan, soon!  November Update: I've been cooking with this pan almost daily since August and I still love it. It heats quickly and evenly and cleans up beautifully. Great pan for the price!"
"Over the years I've learned don't expect to keep a non-stick skillet for more than a couple of years. So I never spend the huge amounts that some brands will charge you. I was happy when a very dependable source, Cook's Illustrated, gave it their top recommendation and it has turned out every bit as good as they said it would and it is inexpensive enough that I will not grumble when I replace it in a couple of years."
"I am one of those folks who always check America's Test Kitchen's reviews before I buy anything for my kitchen. OXO has been the highest-rated recommendation for a few years now. It displace T-Fal, which was another favorite of mine. Why is the OXO version better? First off, it's heavier, more substantial. That means it doesn't warp. A key feature for glass top stoves. Secondly, because it has a steel handle, it can go into the oven to finish cooking. An earlier version had a plastic handle that could only go to 325° - not helpful in most cases. I'm a fan of all the OXO gadgets. Now I can add their cookware basics!"
"This thing is slick in its appearance and cooking surface. I'm using a lot less oil in this pan than I would in others. Less oil in the pan means less extra calories in your food (healthy)! Passes the egg test with flying colors! Also very easy to clean. The handle is cool to the touch when cooking on the stove top and is a joy to hold because of its shape. I haven't put it in the oven yet but I'm sure it works great in there and I would use a oven mitt when pulling the pan out of the oven. I use a Misen stainless steel pan for searing and oven cooking (handles high heat safely), just seared then baked a pork loin in the steel pan last night, delicious. This OXO pan retains heat very well for a nonstick, certainly can't retain heat as well as cast iron, carbon steel or stainless steel but this retains heat better than any other nonstick that I have used. I have now bought a 8 inch version of this pan for eggs and I'm so happy. I cook a lot and even if you only cook a little, buy it. This pan is totally worth it, makes cooking so easy and much more enjoyable."
"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance. He loves it. No warping even heat distribution. We even heat our next day warm up pizza on it. To answer a question that seems to be asked a lot.. Warping is cause by over heating the skillet. The highest temp we cook with it is med to med low. Once we are done cooking it is taken off the hot burner and place on a burner that is NOT in use until it cools down properly. How cool is properly? When it is cool to the touch.. you can pick it up without burning your fingers. Also, taking it off the stove and putting it in cool or cold water can cause warping. (Yes there are a few who do that then wonder why it warps). But mainly your cooking on it with too high of heat. Any light weight metal pan flat or fry pan etc., teflon, or no teflon can be warped that way. We love ours the first one we bought wore out. And not due to warpage."
"I have the large and medium OXO pan. I had the large first, and after months of stress free cooking and cleaning I knew exactly what to get when my previous medium pan bit the dust. As we know, no non-stick pan lasts forever, but these really hang in there. I only hand wash them, of course. They actually do a fairly good job of browning, too, though non-sticks are not ideal for that. They are oven safe to a pretty high temp, so you can do that ""brown first and finish in oven"" thing easily. You have to remember to follow directions. They include them for a reason. Read them. Don't heat them to the high temp, even if your recipe says to. Don't put cold water in directly after cooking. And for the love of all that's holy, do NOT spray with cooking spray, no matter what the directions day in your recipe. It causes gumminess that will ruin the pan. A quick drizzle of EVOO will do the job.  The price is quite good. I have several OXO utensils in my kitchen and I love every one of them."
Arrived Tuesday. My husband unwrapped it. Came in large box wrapped in paper.  He’s been using it. Today is the first time for me.  The skillet is not perfectly round. It looks as though it has been dropped on one side. The rim is slightly flattened.  I don’t think it’s a big deal except that I paid $60.00 for it.
"The instructions for this pan says ""do not use dishwashing soap that contains citrus."" Well, my favorite dish soap contains grapefruit. So I never pour soap in the pan or let it sit in soapy water. Instead, I clean it under running water with a baby bottle brush just until I see the patina barely lighten. That's about 3 swirls of the brush then, hand towel dry. After more than a year of cooking, it still looks and performs great. I also bought a universal glass/silicone lid, 9-to-12inch size, that fits both my Oxo pan and a wok. I've always used this pan on top - never inside of any oven. After purchasing the Oxo, for some reason, I read the instructions and learned about the damaging effect of citrus soap. I don't know if it's the soap chemistry or just citrus juice that will ruin the non-stick surface. Most dishwashing soaps have some kind of citrus in it like orange, lemon, or grapefruit. But, I think the warning is proven true by the reviews complaining about the coating. I hope my review helps others get more life out of their Oxo pan. It's a really good one."
"I have a glass top electric stove. This type of stove requires a FLAT bottom pan in order to cook properly. I purchased a heavy aluminum pan from Sam's Club initially but found the flat bottom was rounded slightly and did not cook properly. I couldn't get the bottom flat so I broke down and purchased teflon coated All Clad fry pan. The All Clad worked great - it was very flat, held heat well and cooked evenly. The only down side was the teflon began to peel a few months after the guarantee ran out. I paid plenty for the All Clad pan and decided to try another brand. After doing my research I settled on the 12 inch Oxo non-stick Pro fry pan. Though it doesn't hold the heat as long as the All Clad I like the Oxo pan better. The bottom is very flat, it heats up quickly and cooks evenly. No regrets buying this pan."
The quality of this item is noticeably better than the tefal. I had always bought the other brand because I thought it had a high quality coating but this is a heavier skillet and it does a better job all around. one of the biggest problems I have with skillets is there handles getting loose over time even more than the finish on the default the finish would be fine but the handle would be coming off. I have another version of this Skillet in a smaller size that I've been using for over a year and the handle remains very solid.but this particular size just works better for the kind of cooking I do and I'm really glad to have finally replaced the wobbly Skillet I was trying to use with one that is a lot safer to use because the handle is firm. But it's also a heavier weight Skillet and so everything Cooks so much better in it.
"This multi-purpose skillet meets many needs. It arrived quickly, packed in a very protective fashion. I had purchased a round soft- bristled brush whose handle can contain liquid detergent to use for cleaning. To date, having used the skillet to sauté, fry, bake, and as a Bain Marie for custard pies, I am delighted with its multiple performances. I avoid the nasty build up of sticky residue that damages non-stick pans by never using spray oils on it. I will never put it in the dishwasher, either. The brush mentioned earlier here is totally adequate for cleaning the pan thoroughly. There are no seams between the.walls and the bottom of the skillet, making it a snap to both move the cooking foods and to clean. It heats evenly. The handle is comfortable in my fairly ancient grip. I am beyond pleased with my purchase."
"When I began searching for a 12"" non-stick skillet I looked at another brand that was formerly recommended by ATK. I then looked at their current recommendation( 2019) the OXO 12"" non-stick skillet and purchased it. This skillet has been excellent for the money spent. A true value. It has seen daily use, being used in the preparation of several meals a day. Seeing this frequency of use, it has been washed at least once or more, by hand and sometimes by machine, each day. The cooking surface and handle each have held up extremely well. The cooking surface has only minor blemishes and the handle is still firmly attached to the pan as it was when new. For the money, the heat distribution, the cooking surface, the handle ergonomics, ease of use and ease of cleaning cannot be beat. I was impressed enough by the product that I added the 8"" OXO non-stick pro to my kitchen in early 2020. Full disclosure: This is the second 12"" OXO non-stick trying pan I received. The first arrived damaged(bent, out of round.) It was easily remedied by Amazon. I returned the first one, and replaced it."
"I purchased the OXO nonstick fry pan as it was the top rated one by America's Test Kitchen. It has more than lived up to expectations. The most important feature is that I can cook eggs and omelettes without the need for oil, though for some applications, a thin coat of vegetable oil before turning on the pan makes the eggs even easier to remove. Around the same time I bought a 8"" Scan Pan non-stick from Sur La Table as someone had given me a gift certificate. When I try to cook eggs in the Scan Pan without first adding oil, the eggs stick. I should add that I cook on a Viking gas stove and use medium low heat to cook eggs. The OXO functions well and at the price point, when it eventually starts showing its age, you won't mind getting a new one."
"I don’t believe in nonstick pads because of the danger associated, however, my 81-year-old mom will not use anything else but us so it was time to replace her older one.  She says this one is very comfortable to use considering she has arthritis throughout her body. It is a perfect size for her and it’s not too heavy to handle. It’s easy to wash and the heat distribution seems to be doing great for her. She has no complaints about it!  That my friends, makes the high cost worth it!"
"This is a great skillet, love it! But the best part is the fact that the rivets that hold the handle on have been coated with the non-stick substance. Other non-stick skillets leave these bare so that everything cleans off easily EXCEPT the rivet heads. Bonus info… we picked this one because we saw that it was a TOP PICK on Cook’s Country Test Kitchen."
"My favorite part about this pan is the handle. It has no openings that can fill with soapy water or what have you. The handle is hollow and yet completely sealed and attached by a fork. It stays totally cool to the touch I really love it. My only complaint about this is that I wish there was a lid because I always cook with the lid over the frying pan so it doesn't splash. It is supposedly a 10 inch lid but when I put a 10 inch lid it is much too small and fits actually inside of the pan. I hesitate to use these lids because I'm afraid it might scratch the inside of the pan. Metal against metal and all. I wish oh it's so made hey glass lid for this pan. I purchased 11 inch pan cover lid, but it was just a hair too large and the lip actually fell outside of the frying pan and made a mess and was unusable."
"We have been on a one year journey for the perfect pan for egg white omelettes using very minimal oil. We were hesitant about the nonstick coating being toxic but read several articles on this pan, and decided to go for it. We cooked a 4 egg white omelette with veggies in 1 tsp oil and it was amazing. Probably could have used 1/2 tsp too and it would have been fine. Hopefully the nonstick coating stays on, will update this review later if there are any changes. For now, this is great."
"I bought this to fill out a set from another well regarded company when their 8"" wasn't available, and I couldn't wait. I wish now I had purchased all of them from OXO. The non-stick coating works beautifully, and the pan heats very evenly. It does show some scratching from the spatula I used to use (also from OXO, which is interesting), but it's very light and doesn't seem to affect the function of the coating - it may have simply been that the original coating was so glassy. I have since started using a different utensil, and it has stopped scratching. It gets used 5 to 6 days per week for breakfast, sometimes for other meals as well. It cleans up easily, and with the full stainless handle, it can be used to finish omelets under the broiler with no concerns. It's weighty without being heavy, so on our electric range it tends to maintain a more even heat than the one it replaced. While it does remain to be seen how long the coating will hold up, so far I can't recommend it highly enough."
"I know oil and butter can taste great... but I wanted to eat omelette without them in my diet. And holy hell does it NOT stick. I just beat the eggs together with whatever and drop it in there. Nothing sticks, except for maybe fatty meats and they barely do, and are easy to clean off with a tissue.  Just use the proper ways to wash it and it'll stay 95% non-stick for at least a year. I have never been happier to own a fry-pan.  Also use a pan cover when making omelettes, just try it and thank me later.  Cons: Will start looking really ugly from the bottom side after enough uses, and you can'y fully clean that if at all. (but who care about that really)"
"So what do I have to add when there are already over 3000 reviews? Just that I have tried a bunch of non-stick pans and found them wanting before settling on this one. The acid test for me is whether eggs stick. They don't, even after repeated uses. This pan is not as thick as the Swiss Diamond pan, at over three times the price, but it still heats evenly and quickly. Little detail: they took the trouble to non-stick coat the rivets, which most other pans leave open to sticking food. Washes easily. Non-stick coatings wear off eventually, but this pan is cheap enough that it won't break the bank when it's time to replace it. A tool that works. Stick with it! (Pun intended)"
"After spending $100+ on a pan with a super duper coating on the inside and specially treated stainless clad aluminum on the outside, we were very disappointed. The special features that were advertised were just plain false when we read the owner’s manual. And then when we realized the warranty was worthless, we were hacked.  We ran across a review from America’s Test Kitchen for this pan. Their testing was thorough and the price was reasonable, so we tried it. I am amazed at how well it performs. In the same amount of time our pricey pan pooped out, this skillet shines. EASY to clean up, very non-stick, and the weight is right. I’m sure we will get another, but smaller size."
"This pan had probably been used every since it arrived. It has a very durable nonstick surface and the edges are angled perfectly so you can easily get at the food. The handle is sturdy, helps me look like a champ when I'm flipping food.  It is pretty thick so it takes longer than most pans to warm up but once hot it retains the heart well and distributes it evenly even with the larger pans in this series.  It cleaned up very easily, it's never been in the dishwasher because it whipes clean without any effort.  It's great for fried eggs but you have to use some sort of oil, I've tried cooking them in this pan without any or very little oil and they end up cooking with a stranger texture."
Cleans easy. Heats well. Non stick is perfect even after 10 months the of everyday use. Try it. Don’t listen to bad reviews
"This is the second OXO griddle I have purchased, the first one having been sent to my grand daughter's college apartment. It is highly rated for a reason. When I looked to replace it, I checked other products, but none compared with this one, which I had owned for several years. I just KNEW I could pay for an All Clad and it would be better. Not so. My main use of the griddle is making breakfast, which starts with sautéing a few peppers in butter, moving them to the side, warming a tortilla on the griddle and adding shredded cheese to it, then, after moving the tortilla, breaking an egg into the peppers, which I've moved back to the center. The new griddle is perfect; I can use the lowest flame on my propane stove and with patience the egg cooks to a perfect sunny-side-up (though I usually flip it & turn off the fire.) I gave 4 stars on the hot spots because yes, where the circular flame hits the pan gets hotter than the 4 corners. This can be used to advantage, as the already cooked items can be moved to a corner while other items get cooked. If feeding more than one person, four eggs can be scrambled and cooked in the pan very nicely. Just learn where your burner's hot spots are so the eggs can be moved around accordingly. Making french toast and pancakes could be another entire review; both do quite well in this pan."
I bought the 8-inch frying pan about 3 years ago and have used it about once a week since then - and it still looks and works like brand new! The finish still looks like brand new and requires no oil to get perfect non-stick performance. This made it an easy decision to recently buy the 12-inch size to replace a T-fal pan that only lasted about 2 years.
"I bought this almost a year ago for making pancakes, and I don't think I've used it for anything else yet, but I've used it several times for that. It's big enough to fit four decent sized pancakes, the handle is comfortable, the heat distribution seems very good (also, strangely, when you get the bottom wet, you can faintly see the distribution design), and it's very easy to clean. Just rinsing it off gets most of the stuff off of it, and a light rubbing with your hand or a washcloth will get the rest. I can't say if it's perfectly flat, since pancake batter is thicker than something like eggs, and so doesn't tend to run as much, but I've not had any problems with it running. I try to avoid nonstick as much as possible, but as long as you don't overheat it and you don't use it when it's damaged, it's (as far as we know) safe, and this seems to be a very good quality coating, so I don't expect any issues with it getting damaged for a long time so long as it's handled properly."
"All the non-stick action you've been wanting. I've made eggs at twice the frequency just because it's such a delight to have zero stickage. I needed a new frypan and hit up America's Test Kitchen to see what their recommendation was. I'm a big believer in pay less for a product and replace it more often in the kitchen (for the most part). Yes, I could pay $400 bucks and have a pot for ten years but how good are those last five? The last two? I'd rather pay a fraction of that and have a brand new one every one to two years. So far, this looks to be an excellent pan for that sort of use case. Heat distribution is very even, the handle is comfortable in the hand, the slope of the walls is quite nice. I like it. We'll see how it holds up!"
"As a loyal ATK follower and foodie, I have bought several of their recommended items. Most work out well, a few have not. My Tramontina pan started losing its coating so, the search was on. This OXO pan is a great size, fairly light and nice looking but, the coating...OMG. This pan is coated with the same stuff Chevy Chase put on his disc sled in Christmas Vacation; no joke its that slick. NOTHING....sticks to it. Its so slick that flipping small items is a bit challenging. Cleanup is so, so simple that this pan should literally never be dirty. So far its a real winner; time will tell."
The OXO 12 inch frypan is an excellent addition to my kitchen. I own but one nonstick fry pan for convenience sake. I'm a home cook and don't require many different types of frypans. My other pans are either cast iron or stainless steel as I feel these pans to be somewhat more health conscious. There are some foods that really benefit from a nonstick cooking surface. OXO has engineered a really nice nonstick frypan. All the reviews I have seen or read about helped convince me to purchase this pan. Eggs and fish seem to benefit the most on this cooking surface. It's a great pan and I'm glad to add this to my collection ( even though it's a small collection )
"I was looking for a non-stick, 8"" fry pan. This was recommended by America's Test Kitchen. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! It cleans like a dream and cooks eggs, etc. beautifully. The only thing missing is a tempered glass cover. However, I found the OZERI tempered glass cover on Amazon. It fits perfectly, has a nice handle, and a little vent to let out steam. LOVE that, too!"
"So far after a couple months of regular use I have no complaints. The pan is easy to use and is a good size for both smaller meals, or cooking vegetables for a family. It has a good Slope to the inner wall which keeps food from getting stuck in any corners or crevices. I don’t have a dishwasher and I only wash by hand, but even sticky messages seem to be easy to clean with just soap and a sponge."
"Bought this skillet to replace my worn out old AllClad scrambled egg pan. This one cooks a bit more quickly but with even heat distribution up the nicely curved sides. The comfortable and substantial handle doesn’t overbalance the pan on the gas stove grates as my old one did. Yes, everything wipes right out as it should in a brand new non-stick skillet. I will give it a while to see how long that non-stick lasts and update. In the meantime it has two features I haven’t had before and really like. The outside is the same dark gray as the rest of the pan and wipes off just as easily so no constant scouring needed to keep it new looking. The iron grate hasn’t scratched it. Second, and even better is that the two bolts attaching the handle are also coated with non-stick surface so no digging out the little of egg stuck between the two. This new pan brightens my mornings."
"I have been searching for a good non-stick pan and was hesitate to pay more than $30 for that. I have used other OXO products and they always meet my expectation. So even with the price ($50) above my budget, I still give it a try. It is a truly non-stick pan, and easy to clean. I made red bean sauce with it which could be a nightmare for any pans, but they came off easily. It says the pan is dishwasher safe but for prolonging the life of then pan I havent tried it in dishwasher yet. It is just soooo easy to clean that I dont mind just wash it separately (I am a really lazy person usually throw everything in dishwasher). So far we are still in honeymoon :) may come back to change the reviews after some time"
"After trying out expensive carbon steel fry pans, I abandoned their high-maintenance, fickle behavior and settled on pans that I didn't have to stress over whether they would become unseasoned for the umpteenth time by just using them. The engineering of Oxy Good Grips Pro is so evident; lightweight but substantial, the non-drip edge is simple but brilliant, the handles are perfectly designed and while I didn't expect it, the rivets have the same non-stick coating as the interior pan surface. I may be delusional, but the non-stick surface seems like it could last more than the 3-5-year life expectancy of the average pan. To back that up, they come with a lifetime warranty! I bought the 8"" and the 12"" and now I'm getting the 10"" before something weird happens and they discontinue the line. Make sure you get the ""Pro"" line, that's the one Cook's rated the best (and it is no-wonder)."
"I’ve got an iron clad 12 inch skillet and I use that for all my cooking. Durable, reliable, backed with life time warranty, just my go-to. But hey sometimes u want some ease and convenience of that non-stick. And without breaking the bank with all clad’s hex pan this is solid pan that should last me a good couple years and I won’t feel spending guilt just tossing and buying a new one. With the rec of ATK I’m happy with this pan and highly recommend!"
"After having purchased many different non-stick fry pans over many years, this one is absolutely the best. I use non metallic implement with this pan. i happen to watch American Test Kitchen and they reviewed different brands. They found this OXO brand to be the best. So I bought one. It is the best I have ever used. Today after a lot of use, it is STILL slick like new. Stuff slides so easy in the pan that there have been times when the spatula had a hard time getting under the item because it slides away from the spatula. I would buy again in a Nano second!"
This is an amazing pan. Love the shape and they way you can manipulate food within the pan. I replaced a T Fal pan that had warped when T Fal made me jump through hoops to get warranty replacement service. I have many OXO products and should have bought this in the first place! I LOVE this pan.
"It's Big. It's heavy. It's got nice depth. The handle stays 'cool' so you can actually 'use' the handle. It heats evenly. Nothing has 'stuck' to date. I'm sure you can find something that will if you try, but we have not had any issue with a variety of meats, veggies and even some cheese. And on that note, super easy to clean (officially Dishwasher safe, but we hand wash ... takes no time). It's a great pan ... to the point our next pot/pan upgrade will be a Misen."
This pan is exactly what we need for our family. It heats evenly throughout so there's no need to move everything to the middle of the pan to ensure it is cooked properly. It is larger than our other saute pans which is perfect for our family meals. The pan is sturdy and seems to be very durable.
"This pan is perfect for everyday cooking. I have not had any food sticking to the bottom of the pan while cooking. As long as you use it right, this would be like a non-stick pan. This is the perfect size for cooking meals for 3-4 people."
"With the size and weight of this pan, it's perfect for everything. I love it and it was worth every penny. Perfect gift for friends who love to cook!!"
"I have purchased several other items from Misen including their non-stick cookware and knives. I have never been disappointed with their products and this pan is no exception. I have used this pan for searing meat, sauteing vegetables, and poaching my morning eggs. It heats consistently and is easy to clean. The handle stays cool and the cover works well. I give this pan my highest recommendation."
"I have previously ordered a Misen knife and never want to buy any other brand again! This time I wanted to test out one of their pans and I am not complaining! This pan beats all my all pans in the drawer, perfect for sauces or anything that you’re cooking for dinner really! Nothing sticks to the bottom or sides, amazing!"
"I have tried many trendy pans and they never impress me, this is the perfect stainless steel sauté pan! It is the perfect pan size for one pan cooking and it cleans up well. Highly recommend!"
I had previously bought one of their knives which was incredible quality so tried this too. Seems just as good so happy to finally have a proper high quality pan that can also go in the oven. Surprised how easy cleaning is too! Recommend.
I recently tried out Misen's tongs and I loved them. They are so easy to use and so I wanted to try out some of their other products. I love this saute pan that I got! It's the perfect size and I know that I will use it for a really long time! I definitely recommend!
"I recently ordered a Misen paring knive , so I wanted to test out one of their pans and I am in love with this product ! It’s the perfect size & the quality is spot on. 10/10 recommend"
"This is an excellent sauté pan! I first discovered Misen when I was given a knife to try and I was blown away by the quality and even ended up getting two more. I recently got their huge shallow roasting pan and I gotta tell ya, it’s every bit as high end quality as my All-Clad set, if this were available years ago when I bought my All-Clad, I would most definitely have chosen Misen over the All-Clad, yes, it’s that impressive, It has a lifetime guarantee as well. It cleans up easily, I use a magic eraser to quickly clean any stains, especially on the bottom from my gas stove. It goes from Stovetop to oven and works on any stove. I will compare it to my twice as expensive All-clad (A-C) for you. *Misen is heavier then All-Clad and feels more substantial. Misen is 5 ply aluminum and stainless clad, it gets hot quickly and retains its heat evenly and will not warp just like A-C but what I love about Misen is the detail to the finish. The edges at the top are smooth as silk and curved, there is no exposed aluminum it is completely covered in polished stainless the A-C has a rough hard sharp edge that looks dull. *the Misen loop handles are thicker, heavier and much better then A-C, the side loops stand away from the pot a lot more, so they don’t get as hot and I can easily get my hand inside the loop. The A-C handles are thinner and indented towards the pot and much closer to the pot making them harder to pick up, my hand can’t fit in the loop and it’s much hotter. Same with the lid handles, the Misen surpassed A-C on handle design and configuration. *Misen long handles are equally well designed as their loop handles. They are solid and rounded, very comfortable to hold and easy to grip and flip. I never liked the handles on my All-Clad, they are uncomfortable and awkward to hold, they are hollowed out not solid. The Misen also has heavier rivets on the handles, wider spaced. *the Misen lid fits down into the pot as does the A-C however, the Misen lid fits better and has much less play side to side. This 3 qt. Sauté pan is excellent, it gets hot super fast and it heats nice an even. As I mentioned, I really love the solid rounded long handles on Misen pots, much more comfortable to hold then the All-Clad hollowed out indented handles, which I’ve never liked. These feel so good and stable in your hand, I love the wide assist handle, I can easily get my fingers inside without getting burnt, see pic. Bottom line, The Misen company has developed a highly impressive, well thought out, supreme quality cookware lineup. You get a huge bang for your buck, these are by far my favorite pots. I now own 6 pieces of their cookware and can’t recommend it enough. All-Clad is good but I like Misen better, it’s heavier and more substantial, really well finished, the handles are excellent, lids fit great, really great conductivity. Highly recommend Misen"
"My wife is something of a good cook and when I had the chance to grab this Misen 3 QT Stainless Steel Sauté Pan with Lid I took it, thinking it might be fun for her to have something ""professional level"" to play with. So far we are both thrilled with the outcome! This Misen 3 QT Stainless Steel Sauté Pan with Lid is top notch to work with, cleans up easily, and the meals she's made have been delicious.  I'll admit, we were both a bit intimidated by the idea of a ""pro level"" anything - would it be too much for us? But my wife jumped in there and so far, she loves it. We have an electric stove and even with that type of burner, it's been easy for her to get the overall pan to heat evenly and well. We dream of getting back to gas, but until then, we know it's a good way to go. She was unsure - the pan didn't come with instructions for clanging - so she did a bit of an online search, found some tips, and so far they are working. It has been easy to get it clean. One thing she came across - using steam wool for stains - she has not tried - nor needed to - but we admit, we're also a bit nervous to do it. But until that time... it's been great. It also holds a great amount of food - more than we have needed - but could even hold multiple items should we so choose.  The steal of the pan and lid is solid, strong, and sturdy. The rivets to hold the few pieces together seem to be top notch and well secured. Not an expert, but our observation is, this is well made.  In the end we are both thrilled and look forward to many more meals. I'll update if there is any need, but we can't see anything beyond this being a great find!"
"This is a sturdy, solidly-built, and beautiful sauté pan. I wouldn't have expected anything else from Misen, as I am familiar with the brand. I own one of their carbon steel pans, as well as a set of non-stick pans, and they are uniformly excellent.  Everything about this pan virtually screams high quality: the steel is smooth and solid, and it has a wonderful heft. (It weighs in at just an ounce shy of 4 pounds.) The chrome handle stays cool, so there's no need for a hot-pad to hold it while cooking. A lid is included.  Although not a true non-stick pan, it hasn't shown any signs yet of allowing food to stick. And lacking the delicate surface of a pan with a non-stick coating, it appears to be extremely durable -- it should last a lifetime.  Its heat retention is excellent. Because of the thickness of its 3.0 mm 5-layer composite stainless steel and aluminum construction, it's a little slow to reach cooking temperature, but that's the price you pay for its superior heat retention and conduction. It stays equally hot over the entire cooking surface. These are the virtues one associates with cast-iron cookware; but unlike cast-iron, this stainless steel pan is safe to use with even highly acidic foods, like lemon and tomato sauces.  This is just a marvelous piece of cooking equipment. I'm thrilled to have it in my kitchen."
"I've ordered a couple pieces of kitchenware from Misen now and will say this upfront: I've been blown away by each and every item I receive. Their quality is top notch. It easily compares with big names like All Clad but in my opinion Misen offers an even better product. Why? Easy: They are more comfortable to use, don't have the obnoxious branding everywhere, and are a much better value. The handles on all of the Misen-ware I've used are rounded and make it very easy and comfortable to maneuver the pans, even when they're loaded with food. No harsh edges here. Their cookware has a simplistic, functional design aesthetic that pleases my inner minamalist (check out their branding ""dots"" in my third pic.) It looks great and functions excellently. I primarily cook on induction surfaces and this saute pan works wonderfully on induction burners. It heats up quickly, cooks very evenly, and holds heat with the best of them. I like that a lid is included but honestly never find myself using it.  Long story short, if you are looking for a semi-pro set of cookware to get into home cooking with or to be your ""buy it for life"" cookware, you absolutely can not go wrong with Misen. The only problem with them is that you'll want to replace all of your cookware with Misen. Happy cooking!"
"Misen has made a name for themselves offering professional/fine dining restaurant-grade cookware for affordable prices. Cooking nerds LOVE their Misen products, myself included. This 3-quart stainless steel saute pan with lid is an absolute must for any serious home cook.  Keep in mind, this is not a non-stick pan! You've gotta know what you're doing in order to cook properly in a pan like this. So make sure you're using a good fat like olive oil or butter to keep your food from sticking.  This pan is extremely versatile as it is compatible with gas, electric, ceramic, and induction stovetops. And it's oven-safe (wow!) which comes in handy on so many recipes. You can sear a steak on the stovetop and then pop it in the oven to finish it off, or vice versa (reverse searing).  The handle is what Misen calls their ""stay-cool"" handle and it's a total gamechanger. No need to worry about grabbing a hot pan handle in the heat of the moment.  This size is pretty much perfect to be your everyday workhorse pan. And the lid allows you to steam your food or keep it warm. This pan is a no-brainer."
"This is a very nice, deeper than usual, and very pretty saute or frying pan. It's very sturdy and should last a long, long time with proper use and care. I love the fact that it came with a lid, which you really need to cook lots of things, yet many pots and pans are sold without them.  This is a very pretty pan, very well made, and it's easy to use, doesn't slide around because of its great quality and weight. It's not too heavy, but it's not a thin pan, which you don't want if you ordered this. I can see myself using this pan for years and years. It's not that expensive when you consider the long years of use you'll get with this pan, and you'll enjoy using it.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves to or just has to cook. It's heavy enough to be stable, no sliding around, and it's easy to clean, very nice to use, and is a very pretty saute pan. I haven't used it yet for deep frying but am sure I will in the next few days; I just don't deep fry very much. This is a top quality product and is worth every penny of its cost. You won't regret buying this pan."
"This pans first impression is that it’s a very heavy pan. With 5-ply, you can tell it’s a heavy bottom pan that’ll be good for roasting and searing.  It heats evenly, and while I did turn the pan halfway through (habits as needed with my other pans), this heated evenly and I didn’t have any piece of chicken that wasn’t browned nicely. The handle remained cool during cooking. Clean up was a breeze as the little browned bits came off easily.  What I like a lot about the design of this pan is that it’s sides come straight up. Unlike regular pans where there’s a curve, and you end up pushing whatever you’re cooking up against edges, this is evenly shaped all around from bottom to lid.  I have yet to put this into the oven, but love that you can do so. It’s a high quality piece of cookware, and well worth the investment! I also used it to make browned butter for a cookie recipe, and it worked like a dream. Very happy with this pan, and look forward to using it for years to come."
"I've been using this pan for about a month and I can't believe how much I reach for it when I cook.  It's such a perfect size for so many things. I use it for almost everything - sautéeing, braising, simmering, and steaming on top of the stove. I can also use it in the stove for finishing dishes as well as using it as a small Dutch oven.  The handle and lid handle are easy to grasp and hold. The pan handle stays cool enough to handle on the stove top, but like all other pans, will get too hot to touch if used in the oven. The pan and lid clean up beautifully and both continue to look like new.  I have All-Clad pans that cost much more than this one, but I can't say that I've discovered any ways in which they are any better than this pan.  I've been extremely happy with all of the Misen knives and pans I have and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who wants high-quality kitchenware that also happens to come with a reasonable price tag."
"I never thought I could be amazed by a pan like I am. I’m not a fancy cook or a fancy food person but I was tired of my old pan mucking up everything I cooked in it. I’m getting older and just wanted to have a nice pan so I got this and what a difference! The weight was noticeable but not too heavy. I love that the handle doesn’t get hot at all. The heat gets distributed so evenly. I cooked a bunch of sausages in it yesterday and they all came out even and nicely browned and just perfect, not kinda burned on one side of the pan like my old one. There were “meat marks” afterwards and it cleaned up just like new so easily. The only mistake I made in cleaning was using one of those soap dispensing sponges with the scouring rough part and it left subtle scratch marks so use a soft sponge to clean it with. This is worth every penny, will last for a very long time, and I absolutely recommend it."
"Update 5/8/22: The dimensions are not listed, but there is an answered question which states that the pan is 10-inch across, and 2-1/2-inch deep.  Summary: We've decided to switch over to uncoated, stainless steel pans. When I looked at our last frying pan, I was more than a little concerned with how much the coating had deteriorated.  And while that could have been scrubbed off while washing, it's more likely that it came off into our food (over years).  Observations: A little expensive but pay now or pay later (in increased health care costs, at a later stage of life).  Pros: Great fit & finish; 5-ply construction gives you the ease of cleaning with stainless, with the lightweight, and faster heating of aluminum. Cons: Cost Conclusion: At $105, rating this 5-stars."
"This arrived today, and my wife tried it tonight. This pan has a large flat bottom. With most pans like this, the sides curve up. So the result is a larger, flat bottom with the same rim size. It is also pretty deep, so it holds more. It is made of a 5 ply mixture of metals, with stainless steel on the outsides, so it has great strength, good heat connectivity, and heats evenly. My wife says this is the perfect pan for Southern fried chicken. Well, it sure was good at dinner tonight. It comes with a nice lid as well. It even has two handles -- the usual long one and another on the other side, so if it is fairly full, you can use both hands to lift it. My wife is in love with this pan, and I am a little jealous."
The Misen 3 QT Stainless Steel Saute pan is very well made. It can be used on any stove type and is oven safe as well. This allows you to transfer from stove to oven with no problems. The handle is heat resistant so it won't get hot while cooking on your stove top. The bottom of the pan is made so that the entire pan heats evenly with no colder spots around the edges. This is a very nice pan and I highly recommend it.
"I definitely like having this style of 3-quart pan, as the wide circumference make it more useful to me than something narrow and deep. I generally only like narrow and deep pots in larger sizes (5-quart or larger) for soups. This pan is great for jam and sauce making, great for deep frying, great for braising. Also handy for cooking pasta. Nice and heavy and cleans up similarly to other stainless steel I have. Definitely works on induction burners, as I used it on mine without a problem. The rolled edge is also wonderful, as it prevents boil-overs. All pans should be designed like this."
"This Misen 3 quart stainless steel 5-ply saute pan is really nice. It's extremely well built and they really did a great job with all the little things. It's comparable or even better in a lot of ways to really expensive brands like AllClad. In fact, I like some features much better like the handles, which are more ergonomic and rounded, and much more comfortable. I love that this pan is oven safe because I will brown something like chicken breasts and then finish in the oven. Overall this is an excellent pan and I will definitely be buying more Misen cookware in the future."
"No complaints for another Misen pan done right. The lid fits well, everything is nice and tight, the handle is comfortable, and the lip is curved well. The oblong shape of the handle makes pouring easy. Proportionally, this sauce pan is as it should be and is good for just so many tasks in the kitchen. It is one of the top 5 essential pans in the kitchen and I can't find anything to fault with Misen's version. The heating of the 5 ply seemed even and the heat retention of the 5 ply took a little while to get used to coming from a much loved and cheaper 3 ply pan. Recommended!"
"Good: -Nice size for simple meals. -Quality looks good. -Cooks evenly on our glass cooktop.  Bad: -I would prefer specific care and warranty information.  I ordered the Misen 3 QT Stainless Steel Sauté Pan with Lid. I like the look and weight of this pan. I like that this pan includes a good fitting lid and two handles. I like that my food heats evenly on my glass stove top. Overall, I think this is a good durable pan."

"Misen is doing a great There is obviously excellent quality control, good materials, and the designs are wonderful. This pan is heavy, even heating, and virtually non stick. The lid fits very well and the helper handle is really useful - you can grab it even with a pot holder. This size is the workhorse of the kitchen, endlessly useful. A very impressive pan for the price!"
"This brand sets itself apart from others to me in so many ways! I use my saute and frying pan so often throughout the week that I've never had one that retained any niceness. The durability of this pan is amazing! It always looks brand new, has an amazing sturdiness, but lightweight at the same time! I look forward to using it every chance I get!"
"This is a high quality pan with enough space to fry chicken for your family or make a fricasee for your next dinner party. The lid fits well and it has a secondary handle that makes it easier to lift.  Very high quality, well-made pan. It should last for years!"
This Saute pan is the best. I have been happily using it for sauces and vegetables and gravies. No hot spots or scorching. The pan cleans up easily. It's durable and beautiful. I'm very happy with this pan. Chefs kiss
WELL MADE AND HEATS EVENLY. CLEANS UP EASILY. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
"This is my third lodge skillet. I typically use my 12 inch for everything, but I live alone, and this is perfect for eggs or grilled cheese. My biggest tip that I can give for lodge preseasoned cast iron---""wash it"" first. I don't use soap, but I use a stainless steel scrubber and hot water and thoroughly scrub the whole thing inside and out. I then dry it over medium heat on the stove, put a thin layer of oil all over the pan with a paper towel and then ""bake"" the cast iron in the oven at 450 degrees until it starts to smoke and stink. It kind of smells chemically. Once I smell it, I turn the stove off, let the cast iron cool in the oven, take it out, and it's ready to use. It may take a couple times before it's perfectly nonstick. Between each use I scrub it with the stainless steel scrubber and hot water and dry over medium heat on the stove. I rub more oil on it after drying about every 10th time I use it, or when it looks dry. I have never had to rebake it. My twelve inch has been perfect for years and this one is well on its way. So low maintenance. Great, heavy quality."
"I'm adding a photo in case anybody else was struggling to figure out what size to get! This is the 6.5 inch. It's the basically size of a regular napkin. I also put a large egg and a stick of butter in to show a comparison. I got it to make pizzookies in (""pizza cookies""), and I ordered too small at first. This size is perfect for me. Lots of people are complaining about the food sticking. I've used my skillets for cookies and eggs (mountain man breakfast), and it hasn't caused me any issues. In fact, my eggs didn't stick at all! (I did use butter in the pan, but I assume that's normal). Overall, great. I think I'll order 2 more to use with friends over!"
"We use this pan for everything except eggs. We've had this one for quite a while now so I feel like i can give a longer term review. The biggest thing I don't like about this pan is that it didn't feel like it came sufficiently pre- seasoned, so we looked up some videos and instructions and did it. Now it feels like the more we use the pan the better it gets. My husband and I both just Love this thing. The only thing it doesn't seem to cook right is eggs. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to cast iron, but once you figure it out, it's very enjoyable to cook on and the food comes out delicious.  Tips on how we seasoned it: there are lots of opinions on which oil to use but we just went with plain ole vegetable oil. We made sure the pan was clean, then covered it with a thin layer of oil. We put it in the oven as preheated it until 475 degrees. Once it came to temperature, we turned it off and just let the pan sit in there until it cooled. The goal is to ""burn off"" the oil, so bring it past the smoking point until it gets dry and hard on the pan. That's what makes it coat well. We did this 3 or 4 times, but the more you use it the better nonstick surface you'll have.  Tips: Don't wash with soap, it'll strip it. We purchased a chainmail scrubber that we love to use. Seems to help smooth it out a little too, but that might be in my head. When I clean it I only use the scrubber and hot water. The more I use the pan the easier it gets to clean. When you finish cleaning it, don't leave it wet. It'll rust. We just put it back on the stove with the burner on until it's dry. Easy. Keep in mind that cast iron doesn't exactly heat evenly, but it holds heat well. This just means that you have to sufficiently preheat the pan before you use to ensure even cooking.  Overall I love this pan! It just gets better every time I use it."
"I really love this cast iron 10 inch skillet from Lodge! I debated for a long time whether or not purchase one, For me, a purchase like this is about an investment, and I want my investment to last a long time.. I also really like the fact that this is made in the USA. American made products are just not easy to find anymore. But really, the proof in the quality of this cast iron was obvious when i made sweet potato corn bread and baked it in the oven in this skillet. It came out so nice and brown and moist. I'm enclosing pictures, so you can see the nice way it cooked the corn bread on both the top and bottom of the bread. Sorry, the pan in the first picture is a bit oily looking....I had cooked in the pan and then washed and oiled it. If you like this review, please click the helpful button under the review. It helps me to know if my reviews help people."
"At 58 years old I grew up using iron cookware and prefer to cook with it whenever possible. I have spent as much as $150 on a top name brand ""non-stick"" skillet only to be donated a year later to the thrift store! ~Never again.  I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance.  NEVER - Use soap or detergent on your iron cookware you'll ruin the seasoning with soap. If you do have a sticking when the pan has cooled add hot water only, allow to soak for about 15 minutes or so and clean as usual. Properly cared for your cookware should last your lifetime, be virtually non-stick and extremely low maintenance.  NEVER - Allow your cookware to air dry. This will cause rust and you will most likely need to scrub with steel wool, rinse, dry and re-season and you may to repeat this process many times to return it to a desirable condition.  Iron cookware can crack if exposed to extreme temperature changes / hot to cold. Food should never be stored in iron, it is for cooking and serving from within a short time period only.  I hope my long winded review/comment has helped in some way. I love my iron skillets. I'll be back for more pieces."
"I bought this skillet a little while ago and I was surprised how rough the surface finish was. It felt like sandpaper. Given all the positive reviews, I was expecting higher quality. After some research I found instructional videos on how to grind these Lodge skillets smooth, but who has time for that? I found two other American producers of cast iron that come with a smooth finish right out of the box: Stargazer and Finex. The Finex looks interesting but I went with the Stargazer because it's fully machined at half the price. Seems like I made the right call. The design is great, the surface finish is super smooth, and it cooks like a champ. If you're reading this review, do yourself a favor and pass on the Lodge. Go with the Stargazer instead. It's well worth the investment."
"I was worried the rough surface would cause sticking, but i have found it to be a non-issue. The pre-seasoning has some issues though. Its not hard to fix, but I don't think anyone should uses these pans as is. If you wipe a clean towel across it you will notice there is a black film. This is not how cast iron cookware should be. What you really need to do is:  1) Scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film 2) Wipe the pan dry with a dry towel. 3) Heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry. 3) Wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan. (any cooking oil is fine) 4) Wipe as much of the oil off as you can with a dry paper towel. What you want is an ultra thin coat of oil. 5) Bake the pan at 400-450 degrees for at least an hour, then let the pan cool inside the oven.  You should now have a well seasoned pan. If there is any black residue when you wipe it with a clean towel repeat the steps above, but it should be good to go after just one seasoning."
"I love this skillet! I've used it on the stove:gas and electric(on glass tops do not drag this skillet on it, it will scratch the glass) as well as over fire outdoors. I've owned it for 8 months now and it still looks as new as it did 8 months ago. Make sure to research how to clean your cast iron cookware and always heat them up to evaporate any surface moisture after cleaning before oiling. I've made many different foods in this, Utica Greens, bacon, eggs, steak, pizza...etc. All have come out perfect. Be aware this skillet is huge so make sure you have room to store it and it is also heavy...About 12 pounds I think, so my wife does have trouble moving it, I also need 2 hands to carry the sucker especially when its loaded with food! I would say I would buy this again, but I see this skillet lasting for ever!"
"If you haven't already taken the leap into cast iron you should think about it. First off the pan is cheap, durable and generally non-stick. Does this mean nothing will stick to this pan? No but if you have the right temperature and use the right amount of fat/oil when cooking and take care of this pan it will take care of you. I would say this pan excels at proteins first and foremost. I have cooked bacon, eggs and pancakes right after one another and nothing stuck to this pan. I would say vegetables are also a favorite in this pan as well because of the great flavor this pan helps create through the oil and char you can achieve with this pan.  If you are the type of person that cooks and then puts the pans in the sink for a later time then cast iron might not be for you but I have left this pan in a sink for a few hours or on the stove top overnight and cleaned the next day so it is worth a shot. If you are the type of person who lets pans soak in water overnight or puts them immediately into a dishwasher for cleaning then this pan is definitely not for you unless you are willing to make an exception with this pan.  Did I have immediate success with this pan right away? No I didn't. I had food stick and I had issues with cleaning the pan and reasoning the pan and had to look for advice on the internet to solve my issues because not many people use cast iron so I couldn't ask them.  Some of my mistakes were simple ones to make as I have always used either stainless steel or non-stick pans. I didn't wait long enough for the pan to heat up. Take it easy and heat this pan up on medium before you start cooking. Don't think this amount of iron will be hot in 5 minutes. You may need to wait 15 minutes to get this pan heated evenly but I would say put the pan on the heat before you start your prep. The next issue is using enough oil. You don't need a ton of oil but you should use a healthy amount. If you are frying then yea sure use a ton of oil but generally your food doesn't need to be swimming in oil but coat the bottom of the pan. I would advise against using black pepper on your steak if searing. The high temps will burn the pepper causing smoke and burnt flavor on your steak. You are better off using just salt before cooking and fresh cracked pepper afterwards. Acidic food like tomatoes are okay in the pan but make sure you have a well seasoned pan. I would stay away from sauces but cut up tomatoes in the pan for your first few uses should be fine. You need to build a good layer first before tackling sauces. This pan excels at bacon and frying so if you are in the mood to do either this pan will be your best friend. The pan is shallow so it isn't meant for deep frying but I have done fish and chicken where I had to flip and it worked great.  Also take care of this pan. Scrub it down with soap and water. Yes you can use soap I do all the time but I also rinse thoroughly and dry immediately over heat and spread another thin, thin, thin layer of oil on it too. Every other month or so I give it a good scrubbing and then apply a light coat of oil and stick in a 500 degree oven, upside-down for an hour or so and then turn off the oven and let it cool. This adds additional seasoning to the pan. You can overseason the pan which I have done and all I did was heat, scrub, wash which eliminated most of the excess seasoning. A salt scrub can help as well or if you really are in the weeds you can get a more aggressive scour pad and remove all the seasoning and start from scratch. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to strip and then dry. The time in the oven will be what takes the most time but at that point its set and forget. You just need multiple layers so it will need a lot of oven time like 6 hours or more depending on your diligence.  The best advice is keep cooking and don't be afraid to experiment, keep the temperature lower than you think you need and don't rush the food it will be done when it is done."
"I ordered this because I have a smaller lodge cast iron pan for years which I love and wanted a larger one to complement. However four months after purchase as I was heating up olive oil on medium High temp , while I was in the kitchen dicing gArlic for it , I heard what sounded like a gunshot and found that the pan split in two. Photo attached. Unfortunately it's past the return date. I'm disappointed because I had good experience with this product before and no explanation as to how a few minutes of heat could cause fracture. Had to toss the pan."
"Throw your money at amazon and never look back. I cook a great steak. I love cooking steak. Enter this cast iron skillet (shout out to my momma for the recommendation). Holy crap this thing rocks. I cook everything in this baby. You ever reheat pizza on a cast iron skillet? You ever get cold in the winter so you just heat up the skillet and let it sit in bed with you? Well I have, and I have the burn marks to prove it. I love this skillet, what a phenomenal purchase."

"Perfect for egg muffin sandwiches, it's the right size and height after cooking compared to the ""Mc"" brand. It is the best I have found after many years of trying. If you have ever wanted to make your own egg muffin at home, this pan is the one to use."
"VERY heavy. Lots of TLC required. Versatile. Multi-generational. Reasonably priced. Lodge seasoned CI-made in USA.  First of all, for those of you who care about country of origin, rest assured that Lodge seasoned cast iron is made in the USA (the enameled Lodge cast iron however, is made in China).  Before I delve into the review of this LCI, let me just warn my readers that CI is rather heavy! If you have arthritis or a weak arm and had, you may want to consider a lighter-weight cookware.  Now on to the “meat” (pun intended) portions of this review…  Cast iron is a forgiving but high maintenance mistress! She will forgive almost anything (even allowing her to rust!!!), but she does require a little TLC before, during, and after each use. The TLC she needs is:  1. Before using: season CI 1) Cast iron must be seasoned before any use; luckily, Lodge double seasons its cast iron so that customers may use the product right out of the box, but if you need to re-season the cast iron product, follow these steps: i) Scrub CI well in hot soapy water. ii) Dry thoroughly. iii) Spread a thin layer of oil (I like avocado oil, but vegetable or canola will suffice) over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts). iv) Place CI upside down on a middle oven rack and turn on the oven and allow to heat to 550°. (PLEASE refrain from placing the CI into an already heated oven; the CI heat gradually in the oven as the oven works its way up to 550 degrees F) (1) ***NOTE: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). v) Place foil on a lower rack to catch drips. vi) Once the oven temperature reaches 550 degrees, “bake” the CI for 50-90 minutes. vii) Turn off the oven and allow the CI to cool inside the oven. ***Reminder: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). 2. During usage: use a “fatty food” the first time you use the CI implement. a. Personally, I love any excuse to fry bacon, so I always “break-in” my CI with bacon slices; however, there are many amongst you who are unable to partake in bacon for religious, moral and ethical, or environmental reasons. For those amongst you who cannot use bacon, cook a food that requires deep frying. b. Pre-heat the CI before using (every single time) or your food will stick and crumble i. NOTE: Although I ALWAYS pre-heat my CI for cooking, I rarely do so for cake-baking; for cake-baking I used a very liberal amount of my home-made pan release “goo” to fully coat the pan, and I pour the cake batter right into the pan; works every time! 3. After using: wash and re-season (NO, not the detailed steps mentioned above) a. After using the CI, and while it is still hot, wash using scorching (wear heat resistant gloves as to not burn your hands) water and salt (refrain from using chemical cleaners) i. NEVER wash in a dishwasher (OMG) b. Dry completely and thoroughly c. Spread a thin layer of oil over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts) and place the CI on the stove top to heat for about 10 minutes d. Store CI in a moisture free environment i. NEVER store food in CI ii. NEVER store CI in fridge or freezer  So that is the TLC required for a CI pan or pot, but there are still several things to keep in mind:  A. NOT everything should be cooked in cast iron! (1) Avoid cooking acidic foods in CI (yes, it is okay to finish the dish with a small squeeze of lemon (not when skillet is hot) or a few drops of vinegar, it is okay to add tomatoes and tomato paste to the dish you are cooking, but it is NEVER okay to stew tomato prolonged periods, deglaze with vinegar, or lemon juice to foods while they were still hot on the skillet) (2) Avoid (at least in the beginning when your cast iron is still getting TLC) sticky foods (fried eggs, omelets, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fried rice, crepes, etc.) as they will definitely stick to your CI; this is not to say that you will not eventually be able to fry eggs or make crepes on your CI, I do all the time, but you will need to have reused and reasoned you CI many times before it becomes fully non-stick. (3) Avoid cooking delicate fish (flounder, tilapia, etc.) In CI because the delicate fish will not tolerate the heat retained by the CI (an asset when searing steak) and will fall apart when flipped. (4) Avoid (particularly before your CI becomes super well-seasoned) using the same pan for savory and sweet as the CI does retain flavors; in other words, using the CI to bake a vanilla cake immediately the day after using it to make garlic chicken may make your vanilla a tad too garlicky! (5) Avoid using CI to cook foods that require lengthy periods of simmering, boiling, or steaming as the lengthy simmering, boiling, or steaming will strip your CI of its hard-earned seasoning.  Are you still reading? If after reading the previous portions of this review, you are concerned about the TLC necessary to maintain CI, then I really recommend you consider other cookware options. (Caphlan non-stick is a viable alternative); if on the other hand, you are still reading, then you are not dissuaded from investing in CI cookware, and I am glad of that!  There are numerous benefits to cooking and baking in CI: 1) Cast iron is extremely sturdy and is very difficult to ruin. (If you do ruin a CI pan, you can restore and reclaim it!). 2) Cast iron heats up evenly and retains heat incredibly well, which makes CI excellent for searing meat, baking corn bread, making pies, baking crusty bread, etc., and for keeping food warm as you serve it! 3) Cast iron is healthy; yes, that is true! During the cooking process a trace amount of iron is absorbed into the foods, and when the foods are consumed by you, you are getting some iron into your system (a healthy by-product of CI cooking). 4) Cast iron is quite versatile. You may use CI for almost everything (you make slow cook a lamb leg to perfect or make a three-layer birthday cake for your daughter in CI). Additionally, CI goes from cupboard, to stove-top, to oven, to camp-fire, and to dinner table! Talk about versatility! 5) Cast iron is of heirloom status; it lasts for generations! I personally have a huge collection, and I plan to bequest my CI to my daughter (it shall be written in my will-not kidding).  So, to re-cap: CI is a rather heavy type of cookware that offers great versatility, heats evenly, retains heat well, requires pre-seasoning and re-seasoning, and is multi-generational. And, of course, Lodge is an excellent CI brand. Lodge was founded in 1896 and is one of the very few remaining companies that still produce seasoned CI in the US (in the Lodge foundries in Tennessee). Lodge products are sturdy, versatile, heirloom-quality, and of course reasonably priced (as compared to the more expensive companies).  I have been using CI (especially Lodge) for two and one-half decades (yes, ¼ of a century) now, and I will NEVER use anything else! A purchase of Lodge CI cookware and bakeware is a very sound investment indeed!  **If you found this review of use, please “like” using the thumbs-up button below.

"I don't even need to review this product because there are so many people who already give it high ratings. But I felt the need to anyways.  I have owned cast iron in the past, and honestly, I didn't get it. Everyone was always raving about how amaaaazing it was and how it's sooooooooo good for non stick. And I would see videos of people sliding eggs out of the iron like it was a non stick pan. I bought a FANCY iron skillet from a high name brand, and I was like....what? What was I doing wrong?  EVERYTHING. WOULD. STICK.  I basically called BS on the whole thing. I then went online and learned all this special care for iron and how you ahve to never use soap, and not be too abrasive or you'll remove the seasoning, and basically all of these things where I wa slike....okay. So.....my food burns onto it, and then.....I can't use soap or an abrasive scrubber to remove it? So....what universe is everyone else living in????  So I gave up on cast iron and happily went back to my anodized non-stick set.  Well after a few years I visited a friend and was cooking at her house. I learned that ALL she had was a full set of Lodge Cast Iron.  THE HORROR.  I was floored with fear because I am a great cook and was 1000% expecting to burn everything to her pans and destroy them.  The cooking, changed my life that day. It was SO. EASY.  Her pans were so enjoyable to cook on that I immediately went home and ordered a Lodge skillet. I was still nervous about it, but at the low price, who cares! I am privileged enough that I can afford to spend $30 to see if I like a pan without going broke.  It arrived, and it's been a life changer. The cleaning is not that hard at all, I do avoid soap but I got a brush to clean it with and all is well. I cook only using butter or bacon fat and the extra savory taste that all of my cooking gets from this pan and it's seasoning is just miles and miles beyond that of my non-stick. I have gone from using a full 12 piece set, to basically only using one ceramic non-stick pan about 25% of the time, and my one Lodge skillet 75% of the time. The best. I want a smaller one too."
"We bought both the larger and smaller sizes. We've had other iron skillets in the past and have to say these are very high quality. Beware, they are heavy. My wife and I were not all that impressed with the manufacturer's pre-seasoning and suggest that you season yourself with a high temperature vegetable oil. Place a thin coating of the oil on the inside of the skillet, heat oven to 350, place skillet in the oven for 1 hour. Turn oven off after 1 hour but leave skillet in the oven until it has cooled. You're ready to go!"
"I love cast iron, got this pan cleaned it with hot water and corse salt, then heated it till all the water was gone, and then applied a tsp of Crisco today I used it to do a small batch of scrambled eggs work just fine. If you treat cast iron right it will last three or four life times follow these rules and you will be happy for years to come.  Lodge Cast Iron CLEANING  I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance."
"This is a BIG skillet! Be sure you want to go this big. I'm single, so I'll rarely need this size. The cute little red handle cover...well, I'm not impressed. Bottom line: whatever I may have used this for, I'll probably still use my big crock pot, and it has a lid. Walmart has these same Lodge items...at better prices. UPDATE, SAME DAY... I just checked my recent Walmart flyer, and ordered 2 skillets, made by Lodge, that I can use, for $10 less that the $42 I paid for this one, that is too big for my oven!!! Returning this one due to high price! UPDATE 21 OCT...I started the return process, was given the options to refund or exchange, opt'd to refund. They're charging me $10+ to return it...wonder what if I exchanged it? Walmart has this exact same skillet for $19.92, it's a ""no brainer"", even when it's costing me $10. AMAZON, I'M NOT VERY HAPPY WITH YOU TONIGHT!!! 22 OCT., I may just keep it!"
"I've ordered two of these 12"" Lodge cast iron skillets from Amazon over the years. The first one I bought years ago for me to use and, more recently, another one for my son's first apartment after college.  For the price, I don't think you can beat cast iron skillets from Lodge. If you google ""best cast iron cookware,"" you'll generally find Lodge listed at the top or at least as one of the favorites by different consumer research sites and publications such as Cooks Illustrated even when compared to cast iron at many times the price.  The only cast iron cookware that I find to be of better quality than these are those manufactured many decades earlier. I have a couple of smaller Griswold cast iron skillets made around 1930-1940 and there's a definite difference. Good quality vintage cast iron cookware is generally thinner walled and slightly lighter in weight. Many of the older pieces also have a raised bottom ridge, or smoke ring. However, the biggest difference IMO is the smooth, polished surface on the vintage pieces. Modern-day manufacturing of cast iron skillets (like these by Lodge) tends to leave a slightly pebbled surface. Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to find smooth-finish vintage cast iron cookware that's in good condition. And, when you do, it's usually quite expensive.  An ultra-hot cast iron skillet is my very favorite for searing thick tenderloin steaks and salmon. I put the skillet (minus silicone holder) into a 500° oven for about 10 minutes to heat it. Then I apply a dry rub seasoning to both sides of room temp steak filets or to top side of salmon fillets. Remove hot skillet from oven (extremely hot, so be careful), place on high flame or burner, and immediately place steaks or salmon onto skillet surface to sear to the degree of browning and crispness desired (usually just takes 1-3 minutes). Flip to other side to sear and then place back into still-hot oven to finish cooking. Amount of time in oven will depend on thickness of steak and/or fish and degree of ""done-ness."" Salmon and other meaty fish don't take long and, since we eat our steaks rare or med-rare, it usually doesn't take more than several minutes in the hot oven to finish.  While the pre-seasoning on these skillets (Lodge uses soy-based vegetable oil) is a nice way to start out without having to do that time-consuming step before using, you'll find that the surface of your skillet just keeps getting better and better. For many things, I find them to be every bit as non-stick as a teflon coating.  For cleaning, I use a scraper if I need to remove anything stuck on, but rarely does that happen. I never use detergent on mine. Instead I use hot water and a scrubbie to clean. Always be sure to thoroughly dry cast iron pieces so that no rust develops. And never ever put them in the dishwasher!  The silicone handle cover is a nice addition for use on top of the stove. While it can handle some oven temperatures, I remove it before placing in a 500° oven since that's higher than the recommended temp for the silicone."
"I was looking to replace my Tramontina 14"" Nonstick Fry Pan which was getting old and the nonstick had lost it effectiveness after almost 8 years even though I used it only occasionally. I like a big pan for family meals or when you just need the room such as making multiple pancakes in the same pan. nonstick/teflon pans are simple to use but they are not made for high heat and the nonstick coat will only last for a few years then it needs to be replaced. I mainly use a large pan for braising or frying meats and vegetables and sometimes adding sauces to them once cooked, like when I cook chicken thighs until browned and then drain oil and add teriyaki sauce to finish the dish. I was going to get another nonstick pan but I have recently started using my Cast Iron pans more so I decided to get the 13.25"" Lodge Skillet at under $40 it is a fantastic deal. I was happy with the size, but beware it is a very heavy pan so my wife can only move it with two hands. Cast iron requires care and knowing how to wash and prevent staining and rust, a few extra steps will keep it great shape and you will have a pan that last decades. I have also seen people doing extreme re-seasoning on these pans to make the sandy texture perfectly smooth on the cooking surface, they are stripping or sanding these pans down. My experience after using this pan for many meals is that it works Great, and there is no need to go to the trouble of resurfacing it. What I did was Wash the pan thoroughly when I received it with warm water and dish soap (this is the only time dish soap is required) and then put it on a medium flame to finish drying it for a few minutes, while it is still warm (carefully) add buzzywaxx or crisbee seasoning all over the pan in a (very very thin coat), put your pan in the oven for 1 hour at 400 degrees and let cool afterward in the oven for another hour, once the pan is cool put a very thin coat of canola oil on it, and your pan is ready to store or cook with! It should be nonstick for the most part but you have to some cooking skills to properly use the pan in accordance with the food your cooking. After cooking just use hot water and a soft brush to clean thoroughly, dry pan and heat on a medium heat until completely dry and let the pan cool then apply a very thin layer of canola oil before storing it. I have cooked eggs, pancakes, meats with sauces, french fries, country potatoes, fajita steak etc... and I have had no problems with cooking or sticking, just great food and a pan that will last forever."
"I am surprised, this was sold by Amazon not a third party. It has a Lodge label, but it does not match the design of a Lodge 10.25"" skillet as it has no secondary handle. It has no Lodge forge marks on the skillet. It also did not come with a silicon handle holder.  This is a cheap Chinese knock off. It is not even 10.25"" in diameter. Sending back."
"Let me say this. I already had a perfectly good 10"" cast iron pan. I did not need a replacement. But when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. I did not want to live life with my plain-bottomed cast iron pan, only to one day die of regret, knowing what might have been. Having this pan, and knowing that it has a classic US coin design on the bottom, makes me want to cook something. And for the cost - a couple of beers at the local pub - I can look forward to years of owning this one perfect thing that pleases me immensely. If you like cast iron pans, and you like classic US coin designs, do not hesitate to buy this. If you know someone who collects coins and eats food, do not hesitate to buy this as a gift. It's a quality pan with a timeless design. God bless you Lodge. God bless us all."
"I carefully read many reviews for cast iron skillets. I had a budget and didnt want to go over it AND I wanted made in USA. Things like this I dont trust Chinese manufactured. There were a few negative comments but for the budget minded and made stateside I pulled the trigger. I inspected it on arrival. Some reviews mentioned it had a rough surface. Mine was very smooth. No signs of any cracks. Yes its pre-seasoned but I seasoned it anyway. Have used at least 4 times and every time have had no sticking, no cracking. After use I wait for it to cool down to ambient temp then I wash it with dawn and sponge. No need to scrub as I havent had anything stick to it yet. I immediately dry with a cloth then apply a few drops of EVOO and work it into the surface with my fingers. Only needs a few drops!! Then I hang it on my pot/pan rack. So far its my favorite pan"
"I've recently gotten back into using Cast Iron. I got a good deal on this one as a ""scratch and dent"" / Amazon Return. I'm not sure where the scratch or dent is / was, but it works like it should.  One thing to keep in mind is that this thing is HUGE. No really, it's bigger than you were thinking. That poses two ""problems"" for the average kitchen user, that aren't reasons to take stars away.  1) This is heavy and (like all Lodge cast iron) has a tiny handle. You'll want to use two hands to move it around once it's hot and is full. Fortunately it has a second handle. Be sure to use oven mitts, welding gloves, or something else to protect your hands, because once it is hot, it is going to STAY hot for a while.  2) Did I mention it's HUGE?! So big in fact that the burners on my kitchen stove don't heat the entire pan very well. You'll want to spend some time (5-10 minutes at least) pre-heating this on a medium low setting before cranking up the heat, and even then you'll probably have a hot spot in the middle, and cooler temps out at the edges. This isn't an issue if you're cooking over a large burner camping / expedition type stove, but burner size should be factored in."
"Bought this Lodge 10-1/4 "" skillet in 2012 from Amazon . It has been well used and is holding up just fine . It cooks everything from roasted potatoes and carrots to baking bread in the oven . Have had no issues with any rusting and rarely have to season it . I do clean it right after each use with hot water , dry it and then coat it with a bit of oil . this pan has now many memories of many family meals . I was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as I did not want a pan that everything sticks to and would be hard to clean . I am really glad I took a chance and got this pan . The non-stick pans that would stick after the teflon started wearing off no matter how careful you were taking care of them , and required being replaced every year have nothing on cast iron . Once your cast iron is well seasoned it is non stick . I paid about $15.00 for this skillet and five years , 7 months later it is in perfect condition and likely will never need replacing . In the same time prior to having cast iron the non stick skillets would have to be replaced yearly . I also bought the lodge cast iron griddle , in fact bought that one first a year before buying this skillet . The cast iron griddle is the best for cooking pancakes . Before that pancakes never cooked right . I also really love that Lodge is Made in America. I have since purchased many more Lodge Cast Iron pans for myself and to give as gifts to others So far all the Lodge Cast Iron purchased have worked just fine. Yes Cast iron takes a small bit of care but it really is not hard to maintain . It keeps food hot a long time and I love that about Cast Iron, going back for second helpings out of cast iron your food is still hot enough to not need to be reheated . Buying the Lodge cast iron serving dishes for that very reason . It is not delicate , it is rough and rugged and will last a lifetime ( Lodge even gives a lifetime warranty on their cast iron ) I read some of the reviews that were saying the quality of Lodge had gone down . I only know that we just bought two of the 8"" skillets and two of the 2 quart pans with lids and they seem of the same great quality as this skillet bought years ago .Thank you Lodge for the wonderful Cast Iron cookware and Thank you Amazon ."
"Awesome skillet! No complaints. It's a larger pan so if you're looking to cook two eggs it might be a little overkill. Two 1lb New York strips fit perfectly with room to spare for some aromatics. There's some reviews talking about food sticking and sending the pan back because of that. I took the time to season this pan twice before I ever attempted to put food into it. The steaks didn't stick and cooked just fine. The mashed potatoes stuck some but I fully expected that to happen. Afterwards during cleaning it flaked right off and barely required any scrubbing. I fully expect this pan to last well beyond my life time and will be given to my kids who will probably throw them in the back of the cupboard, oh well. For $40 it's a helluva deal for a brand new piece. Without a doubt I'll be buying a smaller size for smaller breakfast type stuff. Again take the time to understand how to use cast iron and how to care for it and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for instant gratification, stick with something teflon coated."
"FREAKING TINY! listen up... Here's what you do. You pop an oversized biscuit in it... Cut the biscuit top of at the 1/2 way mark in cooking. Drop an egg with crumbled cooked Bacon on it. Put the top back on. 12 minutes later... Bacon egg and cheese biscuit! All in one time Skillet!!! I love to use this Skillet to make garlic, thyme, butter sauce, for steak! It needs to be cared for like any other cast iron skillet. It needs to be seasoned like any other cast iron skillet. It actually.... Uhhhh... Kinda cute."
"I wanted to get away from PFAS laden teflon so I went back to the basics - cast iron - for my eggs every morning. This is the perfect size. I read another review that said they can't get eggs to come out right on this and I am thoroughly confused. My eggs are perfect every morning. You do need to use enough oil, especially at the beginning, and make sure it seasons appropriately. The description says it is pre-seasoned but I find that it takes a few months to really get good. I still use a small amount of oil every day but much less than I used at the beginning. Overall this is exactly what I was looking for and I love it!"
"Was only missing a 10"" size skillet in my Lodge cast iron fry pan cookware and only purchased those with scenery on bottoms! Look for the wildlife series by Lodge if you don't have. Love this addition to my very useful pans. Sometimes my ""Boy Scout"" symbol 12"" Lodge pan is too big or I need two pans going at once for different items. My other 10"" was a square grilling pan from the wildlife series so this is a nice addition. Arrived in great condition but did want to rust when I put it away first time as ""my bad"" I did not oil first before putting away and I know better 😞 . I feel better buying a product made in the USA! Don't mind paying more and the detail in these pans leaves you with pans that are heirloom and will be enjoyed by many for generations. PS, remember strength training is the best exercise for your bones as you get older so don't let the weight of these pans be anything but one more thing to keep you healthy. 😆"
"I bought this on a whim because of its small size. After I got it I was a bit shock at just how small it was. However , I pushed on. I went ahead and seasoned it a couple of times (pre-seasoning is just the start of the process , not the end point, then again there is no real end point in seasoning) and decided to fry an egg. The little pan worked great. I don't believe there is any spatula that would work with this but if you like your fried egg sunny side up you are golden. However, I like mine 'over easy'. That required a flip onto a plate and a slide back into the skillet. This worked great because the seasoning process had made it very non-stick. It was a pretty good fried egg. Perfect size for an Egg McMuffin. I find that each time I see this Lilliputian skillet on my stove, I giggle at how cute it is. I could be used as a spoon rest as well."
This is a quality pan and became totally nonstick after a few seasonings. Reasonably priced and made locally. This pan will last forever with proper care. Picture shows a batch of latkes in action.
"Updated Review:  I see a ton of reviews that just show people treating and using their cast iron the wrong way so I'm here to set the record straight.  If your pan comes and the surface finish is a little rough, that's fine! You have a few options. You can strip it down and re-season it (This is my recommendation. I never like to trust the factory seasoning), you can just use it the correct way and it will eventually come out smooth as butter, or you can give up right then and there and send in a 1 star review.  #1- Follow the steps to season your pan, but do some google research! There are people out there that have used these things for their whole lives, and their grandparents used the same ones before them. If you season it correctly and care for it correctly, your pan will never die.  #2- Slow heat!! This one is very important! Don't turn your burner to medium-high, throw a pat of butter down and spread some pancake mix. In the words of the illustrious South Park ski instructor, ""You're gonna have a bad time"". Start your heat on low, let your pan warm up evenly and then start to cook on it.  #3- Regardless of what people say, unless you're seasoning your pan, there's no need for soap. It won't necessarily hurt (Lodge even says specifically just to avoid high amounts or strong soap) but you don't need it. Run your water in your sink on hot, rinse the pan off, wipe it with a brush, use a stove burner on low to dry the pan and, if you want, put a very very thin layer of oil (crisco is my preference, just wipe off any excess oil after you apply the thin layer) on the pan and you're good to go for next time. You won't die from anything you previously cooked on the pan.  #4- If your pan cracks or has an issue, contact Amazon/Lodge and they will replace it.. These things are prone to damage in transit simply because it's cast iron. This isn't some stainless steel pan coming in the mail. If you hit the pan against something or it gets damaged in transit, just ask for a replacement instead of posting a poor review. (On that note, these pans are ground on the edge due to the casting process. If your edge is a little rusty, scrub it with some steel wool, season it and you'll be cooking in no time.  I'll stand by these pans. I've treated mine right and they've been the best pans I've ever owned.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  As these reviews cover a variety of Lodge pan sizes, I'll post about all of the ones I have!  I can't say enough how incredible cast iron pans are. They cook flawlessly, they clean up in under a minute and they're versatile! (I season them with a thin layer of Crisco and it works great every time).  I use the 3.5 inch pan for eggs! A sliver of butter in the pan (while it's sitting in a larger pan for nice heat distribution and the ability to easily cover) on medium heat for a few minutes makes a great egg!  The 6.5 and the 8 inch pans I use for a ton of different things but the tastiest thing is a nice warm skillet cookie!  I use my 10.25 inch pan mainly for smaller single size dishes and (even better) pie! Melted butter and sugars in the pan to start and the pie comes right out! The fact that you can put them in the oven just opens so many doors for cooking!  Cast iron is hands down my favorite and I can't wait to have them around my entire life!"
"It's excellent Lodge is still actively making cast iron skillets, as most people that have used one before understand why it's superior at doing what it does, but if not, the maintenance horror stories are enough to scare away new-comers. Yes, it's a bit pricey compared to the Teflon Madonnas at the retail stores, but it's worth every penny. This pan came pre-seasoned, so literally it was a quick wash, and straight to business. Quick wash of water after, throw some Kosher salt in and give a once over with the dish sponge, dry it good, back on the stove to completely dry, then grab some good quality oil, light coat, wipe away excess, and prepare for the next meal. After a while, it's too easy, but the non stick and the ability to cook high fat foods in their own juices; can't beat it"
"Lodge remains on the top of the cast iron game. This 12"" skillet is heavy with no false rim that gives the appearance that sides and bottom are thicker than they are. The skillet has an even but course surface which is perfect for the seasoning to build upon and won't come off when using a steel spatula. (Btw: years ago I bought a milled/super smooth skillet and never again). The bottom of the Lodge skillet is perfecty flat with no annoying rim to hang up on a burner grate and allows for good contact with flat cooktops. The skillet holds a very even cooking heat at all temperatures. The skillet comes pre-seasoned, however, I hit the skillet with a coat of flax-seed oil and baked it on in a 425 oven for a couple hours. Kudos to Lodge for kicking out one of the best performing skillets out there."
"So, I haven’t cooked in cast iron in a good few years. Between moves and my busy lifestyle I’ve either sold or misplaced my skillets. So, what do I do when I need a new cast iron skillet? I go to the best of the best: Lodge. Made in Tennessee by hard working Americans, this cast iron is the best of all the skillets I’ve tested. You can tell the quality and effort made in producing a cooking medium that will last a life time. It’s pre-seasoned with food grade oil in the final stages of the factory process. It came in excellent packaging and right on time. The heat dispensation and retention is excellent. Just make sure you don’t grab the handle unprotected during use. Once I received it, I immediately went to cooking. Let me say, this skillet has made me fall in love with cooking again! I’m a father of three young children that require a full, healthy breakfast and this skillet helps me do that. Shoot, I find myself preferring this skillet for everything. I look forward to cooking on it and will fondly look at it whenever I venture into my kitchen while my other pans gather dust. From meats to pancakes, this skillet is my go-to for it all. It’s non-stick capability is unmatched. Just season it periodically and clean it like advised. The only thing I wish is that I had more of their cast iron kitchen utensils! This is not a paid review. This is my emphatic, pleased response from a product that was made with as equal of passion. I encourage anyone researching cast iron to go ahead and purchase something from Lodge. You can even go online and look at videos of their manufacturing process. You can’t go wrong here!  With that, I conclude this review. I’m off to use my cast iron skillet again!"
"Okay.  So you've bought a cast-iron skillet, so you're clearly prepared to put some effort in. First thing's first, you need to make your cooking surface smooth. Before you do any cooking in it at all, go out and buy a packet of the roughest sandpaper you can find, and then a couple sheets of 200 grit or so. Sand that bad boy until it's silky-smooth, clean it really really really well with soap and a gritty sponge, rinse it, then pop it in a hot oven to dry. Season it a few times with flaxseed oil or Crisco like our ancestors used to, then you're ready to go.  THIS THING IS AWESOME. I love it so goshdarned much. Lodge makes some of the lowest-cost iron around, and it punches WAY above its weight. It consistently rates among the heavyweights like Stargazer and Butter Pat, and the reason is pretty dang simple: Lodge gives a darn about making high-quality items that are a pleasure to use at a price point anyone can afford.  I love this skillet. If my house was on fire I'd have a hard time choosing between this skillet and my kids."
"I purchased the Lodge Cast Iron 10.25"" Skillet and was very happy with it that I later purchased a few of the 6.5"" skillets to use when camping. My review is the same for both sizes!  The first thing I did before using it was washing it in boiling hot water (no soap), and using a stainless steel scrubber. I then dried it and seasoned it by rubbing a generous coating of bacon fat all over the inside and out, placed it on a drip pan, then ""baked"" it in the oven for an hour at 475°F. I repeated this process every time I used it for the first few months, (mostly using coconut oil instead of bacon) and eventually it became slick and nonstick.  This skillet allowed me to produce crispy crusts on apple pies, gorgeously brown crusts on corn bread, roasted vegetables, crispy fried chicken and roasted whole chickens, quiches, and delicious frittatas, to name a few.  Unlike my experience with the Lodge Dutch Oven, there was no horrible metallic taste to foods and no rusting. The skillet is heavy duty, heats up, and retains heat well and was made in the United States.  Overall I highly recommend Lodge's Cast Iron skillet in both sizes. With great care and maintenance, the non-stick quality is as good as traditional non-stick pan, without the hazards! Grade A!"
"★★★★★ from California Transplant on October 2, 2017  I'm a Believer  I saw a recipe in a magazine for an Orange Thyme Upside Cake that was baked in a 12"" cast iron skillet. The side bar to the recipe rated this Lodge skillet as the top brand for cast iron. So I ordered one and made the cake per the recipe. The cake came out perfectly, not only in look and taste, but also in release from the skillet. My husband did help me turn the pan upside down onto the cake stand which I held up next to the pan as he turned it. (He wanted credit for his efforts.) And like the info in the listing said, this skillet was ready to use straight from the box. I did wipe it out first with a damp sponge and did not oil it as my recipe called for making a buttery topping in the pan and additional greasing/oiling would have been redundant. Clean up was a breeze. My parents had a big cast iron skillet that they cooked in regularly and I disliked it because it was so heavy and industrial looking. Now I think I understand their preference. Yes, it's heavy, but the additional lift handle makes picking it up much easier. And, of course, the weight is part of the reason the pan works so well. So, you might say that at long last, I have become a believer. I am thoroughly happy with my purchase of this Lodge skillet and look forward to using it many times in the future. I may even buy a smaller sized one as well!"
"Okay, so I waited a LONG time to review this, not purposely, but rather because I am going to buy a second one now and wanted to review!  After 2 years, I can confidently say this is a GREAT buy for a multitude of reasons. Cast iron pans are so versatile and if you take care of them, will last a lifetime.  First off, the seasoning it comes with is not the greatest. If you want, wash it off with warm water, some mild soap, and a wire/steel brush. Ensure you SEASON it after.  In the beginning (first 20 uses), I would highly recommend you SEASON after EVERY use. It may seem excessive but it pays off, trust me.  I prefer to use Flax-seed oil (not refrigerated), a rag (a few I have set aside only for this purpose) and a HOT oven. Go on youtube on how to properly season and do it religiously in the beginning. If you do it enough, afterwards you won't have to season every time (maybe every 3-5 times) and it'll have a beautiful non-stick layer.  For cleaning, I've learned the best method is the following:  1. Buy a Stainless Steel Chainmail Scrubber. 2. Buy heat-resistant gloves (I already had some for my BBQ) 3. Buy some regular sea salt if you don't have any (Mortons works well).  Now, here's the process:  1. As soon as you're done cooking in the pan, (food has been taken out), pour some salt into the pan (enough to cover the surface), throw the chainmail scrubber in there, and add about half a cup of water (enough to bring the water level to cover the entire bottom of the pan). Doesn't matter WHATS in the pan (eggs residue, fish, steak, chicken, sauce, etc.), this is the best way to start.  2. Turn the heat on your stove to Low and let the water and salt warm up in the pan. I usually let this stage happen while I'm eating.  3. When the water is hot and almost boiling in the pan, grab your heat resistant gloves and take the pan with the water, carefully, off the stove and over to your sink. While you're holding the pan with one hand, use your free hand to work the chain scrubber all over the pan and rinse under HOT water. If the pan is too heavy for you, you can let it rest on a heat-resistant mat on your counter or on your counter if you have marble/granite or any heat resistant counter-top.  4. As you work the chain scrubber on your pan, the salt and hot water should basically help get everything off the surface of the pan. Run the pan under hot water and keep scrubbing until it's clean. Never use dish soap to clean the pan.  5. Dry pan with specific tower or rag (this should not be a tower you would use for any other purpose as it will stain) and if you still want to dry more, put on stove top and turn on high for a few minutes to heat up the pan and evaporate any remaining water. Ensure your pan is DRY as any remaining water will RUST the pan.  6. Season if you need to.  All in all, excellent pan and after 2 years, still looks new following the process above. I've used it for eggs/breakfast, salmon, steak, fish, pasta sauce, potatoes, frying, and pretty much everything else and it's as good as day 1.  I've seasoned it enough now that without any oil, I can cook eggs on it and it will not stick. Though I never do this, as I like to throw in a little butter to fry my eggs in the morning!"
"I see all sorts of reviews on here about food sticking and rust forming, but IF you season your cast iron properly, this won't happen. Don't go by the labels of ""Pre-Seasoned"" either. Do it yourself! The first thing I do with my Lodge pans is sand the interior with 60 grit paper on a power sander to remove the rough texture, then wash it with hot soapy water, dry it out then place on an eye to heat ALL traces of water out of the pan. Then when it's too hot to touch, but NOT smoking, wipe down all surfaces with some Grapeseed oil. Pre-heat the oven to 400°F. 10 minutes after wiping the pans with the oil, remove any excess oil until it's ALMOST dry. Put the pan in the heated oven, upside down and leave it for an hour to bake. After an hour, turn the oven off and leave the pan inside to cool down naturally. That is one seasoning cycle. Do this approximately 4 or 5 times total and your eggs will slide right out of the pan. After this, NEVER use soap, otherwise you'll have you season at least a couple of times all over again.  Side note for first time cast iron users: ALWAYS pre-heat the pan! If you don't your food can stick even in the most well seasoned pan. That also goes for stainless steel!"
"I have been looking for a skillet that was the perfect size for two people (enchiladas in an oversized skillet is no bueno). This cast iron dream is great, and for the price, you really cannot beat it. Super heavy duty. Make sure to season the skillet prior to use, as it will get rusty otherwise immediately after you use it. If you don't know how to season a skillet, here are some skillet seasoning skills I shall bestow upon you:  -Scrub it in hot water with dish soap -Towel Dry (DO NOT AIR DRY) -Spray it with vegetable oil - just a little, enough to cover it -Wrap it in tin foil, turn upside down and onto the rack in your stove at 400 for 30 minutes -Let it cool -YOU ARE SEASONED!"
"This pan is amazing. If you have never tried cast iron, you should. I have used (far far more expensive) ""swiss diamond"" nonstick pans in the past, and while that doesn't scratch as easily as other nonstick pans, it still wears out. Even with a lifetime warranty, you still pay shipping when the screws wear out. This pan, on the other hand, is indestructible. I have left the heat on and forgotten about it, no problem. I can use a sharp metal spatula without worrying. The iron even seems to add a bit of flavor to the food. As for non-stickiness, the other day I cooked an egg in it with just a tiny bit of sausage grease. The egg didn't even try to stick. For cleaning, it is a breeze as you just run some water over it and brush off any gunk. If you find out a way to get something to stick to it, you can just put it in the oven to burn it off, and reseason. Try that with a nonstick pan.  Last but not least, this is the new weapon of choice if a burglar comes."
"First of all, these cast iron pans are extremely versatile and durable for cooking. Second of all, you don't have to worry about any PFOA or other types of coatings coming off in your food and you ingesting them in some way. Third. cast iron cooks extremely evenly, and does an amazing job in browning all type of foods.  Personally, I use it for cooking sliced fingerling potatoes in olive oil. The 10.25 size allows for more than enough potatoes, and doesn't require you to use a bunch of expensive olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan for frying. If you buy the pan, you'll have to try this -- the potatoes are easy to make and absolutely delicious. Also, for the issue of splatter - I've found that my Swiss Diamond glass lid fits pretty good - not perfect, but since I already have it, and I don't need to store yet ANOTHER lid, I highly recommend using another glass pan lid if you have one rather than having to buy a new one. I also purchased the Lodge silicone handle, at only five bucks - it makes dealing with these hot handles much easier and at that price, I highly recommend it.  Finally, you have to love that this is a 100 + year old legendary American made and owned brand. The fact that you can buy this at the same price as some no-name Chinese pan is a huge bonus, and you really have no excuse not to buy the Lodge.  Enjoy!"
"I'll start by saying I absolutely hate the pre-seasoning Lodge uses on all their stuff, it sticks and is generally just not great. HOWEVER the iron is great quality it just takes a little TLC to get it to the point that it's truly non stick. What I did for starters is I used yellow cap easy off oven cleaner with lye and coated the skillet thoroughly and sealed it in a trash bag, then after about two days pull it out and wash all that seasoning off down to the bare iron(May take two passes to get it all off) Then I took my sanding mouse and smoothed out the iron inside the skillet, once it was nice and smooth to the touch I gave it a nice wash with soap and a sponge. And after all that I began the seasoning process, I use flax seed oil for the initial seasoning then grape seed oil for maintaining it. I seasoned it three times and after that the beast was non stick and I could slide an egg around in it. I have to give credit to the idea of sanding it to Kent Rollins on youtube, I suggest any beginner to go check him out he has some great videos about cast iron. Anyways all in all I'm really pleased with this skillet and would definitely recommend it."
"This was my very first cast iron and I am inloveeee!! GREAT quality, sturdy, great with heat and I mean the cast iron speaks for itself. Season upon receiving (not required, it comes pre-seasoned) and just take basic care and this bad boy will last hopefully more than 3 generations for my family lol. Properly dry, DON’T USE SOAP BESIDES 1ST USE, and enjoy. I personally use crisco shortening to season my pan….once again not a requirement. you can just use it to cook fatty foods and it will become more seasoned overtime. If you are a newbie like how i was to save you a google trip seasoned=nonstick basically. this cast iron will get to the point of just sliding and surfing no stick! heats up very fast! Also another beginner tip…..DON’T OVER OIL YOUR PAN….I REPEAT DO NOT OVER OIL…you will cause it it to become sticky. make sure to always wipe off with lint free cloth and if ya don’t have one a paper towel will work just fine although not suggested. One last newbie tip, oven or stovetop works equally fine to help coat the season…youtube was my bestfriend just check out multiple diff vids. happy cooking!!!! i plan on purchasing the grill cast iron skillet next!"
"11/2016 Bought three of these and all of them are working very well! I seasoned each of them 5 times total with olive oil, 500 degrees for an hour. each time letting them cool down in the stove overnight. Very easy to clean up with a lodge scrapper. They are now nonstick to my satisfaction and i look forward to cooking many meals in these well made skillets. Except eggs. Cannot cook eggs yet :-( They stick like crazy glue...  Update: 2/2017  Finally got the skillets to the point where I can cook eggs and French toast! I re seasoned the skillets with left over bacon fat. Light coat and an hour in oven at 425. Throw a small amount in before cooking and bam, non stick! I cooked the eggs and French toast at setting 3 or 3.5 on my electric stove top. Works great!"
"When I realized that I had purchased this 8 years ago, I figured it deserved a review. This skillet has been used almost daily in those 8 years, has weathered being moved between 3 states, and is still as good as the day I bought it.  Some notes: 1. Do take the time to look into proper care for cast iron. Mine is well seasoned at this point, so it really only requires minimal cleaning. 2. Don't soak things or leave it wet (it'll rust) 3. If you have a stuck-on mess (should happen less and less over the years), use a little soap. But make sure you take the time to re-season it a bit afterward. I like to rub it down with a little oil and heat it up on my range. 4. I've put this through my oven's self-cleaning cycle twice (followed up by a nice re-seasoning). It literally returned the skillet to brand new!  This is a great skillet, and I now own it in a few sizes. Take care of it, and you'll have it for years!"
"I grew up in a very blue box Mac n cheese household and regarded cast iron as somewhat mystical for a long time. “You’ll ruin the seasoning,” etc.  As years wore on I got to be a better cook and eventually took on cast iron cookware. And now I realize I was late to the party!  First of all, this pan is huge. You can’t lift it with one hand and two takes some effort. In fact, everyone makes fun of me and my “giant cast iron pan”, but I use it for everything and it’s roomy enough to spread things out. Heck I even make 3 pancakes at once in it.  Turns out cast iron is the original non-stick cookware and caring for it is as easy as 1-2-3:  1. While hot, wash after you’ve plated your meal. Just use hot water and a nylon scrub brush, no need to use soap, the whole operation takes ten seconds.  2. Dry it off right away with a towel.  3. Pour in a little oil and smear it around with a paper towel. Park it on the stove for next time. You are done!"
"When you need a BIG cast iron pan, this is it. This falls in the be careful what you wish for category, like 12” chef knives. It’s heavy, and big, so washing it by hand in the sink you need to take care not to dent the steel or chip the countertop. It’s not going to play nice in a jumble of other pots and pans in that hard to reach occasional use cabinet. But it does what only a cast iron pan can do. Also makes a passable cat bed."
"Well I bought this five years ago and figured it’s probably time to write a review. Up until last year it was my only pan. I cooked fish, pizza, sauces, meats, eggs etc. About a year ago it started having sticking issues. I fought with it on and off trying to get it to reseason. I finally fixed it yesterday and had scrambled eggs sliding around better than a nonstick pan  Issues: smoking is a problem, it heats up real hot and the oils you add start smoking. Sucks if you don’t have great ventilation which is us. So I had a lot of trouble getting a reseason as I cant use the oven to do it without filling the house with burnt oil smell. There doesn’t seem like to be a way around this unless you have a grill or good ventilation  I used my charcoal grill fired up to 500f for three hours after scouring the pan and put on thin layers of flax oil every 45 mins. This morning it was better than our non stick pan which is definitely seeing its end of days after one year of use. So after five years it’s like brand new which is exciting. That’s something you just can’t do with other pans. I ha e no doubt it’ll last my lifetime as long as I don’t temperature shock it."
"These things are easier to clean than aluminum pots with garbage burned on.  This isn't rocket science. Don't overthink it. Youtubers already laid out easy instructions. Just re-grease it top and bottom after use and heat it up on the stove to set in. Don't leave it moist. I can't believe how many people are ranting like millenials rust rust rust 1 star review.  If it's that hard just go watch a Gen Z review and learn from them. They smarter than a millenial.  My first use I tossed in left overs with shredded cheese on top. Yeah it was caked on. I don't have a Lodge Scraper yet, so I used copper scrub pads and lightly got it off really easily in 5 minutes under hot water. Just the water. Dry it down good. Grease it up i used a dash of olive oil, people said they use crisco. Polish it up, heat it on the stove. Call it a day. People 100 years ago didn't need ""LIFE HACK"" video for common sense. Feels wonderful to use, keep the heat low.  If it's that hard to understand probably better to return this FINE Cast Iron Skillet for something more appropriate for Millenials like Nintendo Amibos or My Little Ponies. GG."
"This pan is great, I think its a nice size and you can cook a lot of things with it, its really good for induction tops, but if you got a glass top I recommend parchment paper to go underneath it to prevent scratching. Great for searing meats and things.  I think many of the reviews that involve rusting and what not are because people did not take care of their cast iron properly.  Rule of thumb: You shouldn't wash your cast iron with soap and water, just give it a nice rinse and scrub it with a hard side of a sponge, immediately dry it, and slather some oil around it to preserve the seasoning. If you just take care of your cast iron, it will do you a great benefit.  Cast Iron is really good for you in general, as you can cook using high heat and it won't release chemical fumes unlike using a teflon coated pan. You can also use metal utensils on cast iron when cooking, I would limit the use, but again no teflon chemical poisoning. It also cooks very evenly and distributes heat nicely, while aluminum pans may also do this, there is a lot going around about aluminum leaching into food while cooking, you should stick to anodize aluminum instead.  Just do your research before you buy the cast iron, it's wonderful, and even better if you use induction cooktops."
"This is an amazing deal especially if your willing to put some elbow grease in. The pan comes pre-seasoned, but I wanted my pan smooth as glass. I ordered 240 grit sandpaper on Amazon for $3. I left my pan on the counter and I would sand the bottom of the pan 10min here.....5min there. I just did it little by little when I had time. After 3 days of doing this off and on my pan is as smooth as glass. It's literally a night and day difference with minimum work. I didn't sand the whole pan just the bottom. Now I will re-season it and it will be as non-stick as teflon, but without the danger. 240 grit sandpaper is extra fine and will remove those big pours and lumps on your pan. Also you cant go wrong with LODGE....its real cast iron made in America."
"This is my first cast iron skillet and I was worried about it rusting. But after some research online I'm slowly getting a better understanding on how to use and care for this type of pan. When it first arrive, I lightly cleaned the pan to wash away any residue from shipping (the box was very beaten up when it arrived). The first thing I cooked was a fried egg and it did stick a little to the pan. The key is to wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil and then the egg. Depending on your stove type you'll need to figure out the strength of your fire (if a gas stove) or the heat on an electric stove. The advice I found online said the skillet hasn't developed it's non stick surface yet. So I made a few more fried eggs later in the week and it started to improve. Each time I used the pan, I cleaned it right away with hot water and very minimal dish soap. Then I placed the pan on the stove to dry off. If the surface looked dull, I added a coating of oil. A week later I cooked some bacon and that helped season the pan a bit more. Today I made some fried chicken and after cleaning the pan of excess oil, my skillet is looking to be taking on a good surface. It's not greasy or sticky. I know eventually I'll get to sauté some vegetables, pan fry tofu, or make a few pieces of french toast without them sticking to the bottom."
"We had forgotten the unsurpassed properties of cast-iron cookware. As most people, we opted exclusively for Teflon, granite, or ceramic coated pans and pots: Not to mislead, we still use them.  However, if your looking for high temperature searing and straight into a 450 degree oven, cast iron is the only choice.  How we rediscovered cast iron cookware: We bought some 2"" bone-in pork chops at Costco. But how to cook without drying them out?  We Googled ""How to cook thick pork chops"" and came across several recipes. The main thing they all had in common was the use of cast iron.  Basically, you pre-heat your oven to 425-450 degrees. Meanwhile. put your cast iron skillet on a stove-top burner set on high. Season your olive oil coated chops with Kosher salt (sea salt) and coarse ground pepper. Once the cast iron skillet begins to smoke, sear your chops on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).  Immediately transfer the skillet (with chops) into you pre-heated oven. For 2"" chops we bake 5 minutes per side.  That's all there is to it. Moist and delicious. Since then, we have followed the same process to lamb chops and fish...adjusting time in the oven.  PS: If you make spaghetti sauce from scratch, use a cast iron pot. Why? You end up with a delicious iron enriched sauce."
"My wife has been using this skillet about 3 times a week since she got it. It came oiled & ready to use. She made some stove-top chicken with what they call smashed potatoes which was fantastic. Looked just as fantastic as it taste. I am amazed at all the recipes that are out there online. I think she got this one from Facebook but I assume Amazon probably has recipes somewhere on the site also for free. If I would have known she'd be getting one of these skillets, I would have went garage sailing more this summer since they're usually a buck or 2. I can tell you from a husbands point of view who's not the cooker in the family, guy's, if you are looking for a gift for your wife, get one. You won't be sorry. For you ladies reading this, it's great. You'll be amazed with what you can cook with it & the recipes out there are nothing short of fantastic. I'll post another review with a photo this week I had to fix the errors on this review because I was calling it a pan & not a skillet. I just ordered her a 12 inch skillet with 8 egg/pancake rings I might as well get those accessories since she'll be doing Sunday morning breakfasts again. The egg rings do help you make the eggs all uniform. With our 18 inch X 12 inch electric skillet, she'll be able to cook 8 eggs at a time, which helps out, plus it helps you make a restaurant style egg, without any broken yokes or egg runs where it looks like one gigantic egg, at least when I am elected to cook that's what usually happens. As for using the Egg Rings for Pancakes, our favorite server at our neighborhood restaurant told us that if we can't get the Real Restaurant Pancake Mix, use Sprite or 7-Up in the place of water, when we make our Pancake Mix. Not only will they have a sweet taste but they'll be nice and fluffy too. One more thing, if you like to cook outside on a grill over a log fire out on the pit, there's nothing around that beats a cast iron skillet. Those Teflon coated skillets warp so easy, they can get ruined after just one meal made outdoors & you now how good food taste's when you cook over an open fire.....Dan"
"After using very expensive hard-anodized skillets for years (so that I didn't have to use butter or oil), they started to fail. When I went to get a replacement because they were guaranteed for 10 years, or life depending on who I asked, I was asked if I had been using oil and subsequently told that even though they were hard-anodized and didn't require oil, I should have been doing so. For health/ nutrition reasons, I had started to use ghee about two years ago so I did some more research and decided to throw away the hard-anodized (since it didn't stand up to what it says it does) and try cast iron.  This is the second Lodge skillet I've purchased. With the first, I didn't know what I was doing and I struggled. Food stuck and clean up was a nightmare. Since I no longer had the hard-anodized to fall back on, I decided to really try with the new cast iron skillet (this one) by following recommendations I read on several websites for seasoning and cleaning (including buying a stainless steel enmeshed silicone sponge, scrapers and a scrub brush).  Now, everything is great!! Food no longer sticks (although some things do still leave a little residue, e.g., scrambled eggs and salmon) and clean up is a breeze. I seasoned both skillets (bought the cast iron oil, which is really just flax seed oil I think, and put them through 5 seasoning cycles) and try to use both regularly. I clean them by rinsing with warm water immediately after cooking using the stainless steel sponge or brush; initially I was afraid the food would get cold, but the skillets clean in no time. Then I dry them well and put them back onto the stove top or in the oven to let the residual heat dry off any remaining moisture (I've read that rust can be a problem).  The skillets do get hot and they hold the heat really well, so I've had to learn to cook a little differently, but nothing has burned, yet anyway. I do use a little ghee every time and try to make sure that I get it into and up on the edges as it melts. The red silicone handle that comes with the skillet is great at protecting my hand from the heat although I am careful to have another potholder nearby.  When transferring the skillets to the sink to clean, this skillet is easily managed with one hand, but the original one I bought, which is larger, can wobble a bit due to its weight so two hands are needed.  I know this is long, but I was so afraid of cast iron before really learning about it and wanted to share my experience to help anyone else thinking the same.  I'm so glad I made the switch. From what I've read, it should get easier and easier to use as time goes by. It's my belief that's it's a healthier way to cook as well... and the browning on things like breakfast sausages is amazingly delicious!!!"
"I'm giving this a five-star review because it is an excellent pan. Unfortunately, I already own this pan. Whoops! We got one this size for our wedding. I really thought that eight inches was bigger than this, lol.  So, I'm posting this review so y'all can see the frying pan WITH my hand in the pic as reference so you can actually tell how big it is (spoiler alert - not very!) It does fit four eggs or four fat sausages, in case you're wondering, but I wouldn't put a fifth one in.  Anyway, don't make the same mistake I did - order the right size!"
"This was my first cast iron pan. I had heard about them and their brilliant heat retaining properties. When I got it I read a few guides on how to use it. You always need just a bit more oil and time, as you have to transfer more heat into this pan to get started. Once you've done it, you have a brilliant cooking vessel for making tender vegetables, excellently browned meats, pizzas and even full pies. Just use the pan itself as the serving dish!  There are lots of dishes I like in this but here are some highlights: * Pork Tenderloin (shown, with BBQ seasoning) * Steaks * Fajitas * Pancakes * Apple Pies * Breakfast Hash * Bacon (back or streaky) * Sausages ... anything really.  If you look at the history behind cast iron pans, people have been using them for years, for basically everything.  You do have to care for your pan. Learn how to season it, learn what not to cook in it (high sugar items can be troubling) and learn how to clean and store it. On that last one, I heat it up to get it very dry, then rub it with a bit of coconut oil and let it cook into the iron. Before it all burns off, turn off the heat and just leave it. That will keep your seasoning happy.  I can see this being passed on to my kids one day  Pros: * Excellent heat retention * Brilliant browning on Meat and Veg * Virtually impossible to hurt it * It's fun to learn how to use it well  Cons: * None  Notes: * Requires reseasoning every so often  I bought this with my own money"
"What is this thing that I bought?!? I followed the instructions from Lodge that came with the skillet (wash with soap and water, then season with oil) against my better judgment because I never use soap and water on cast iron. I have just thrown out a third scrub sponge and wasted another 20 minutes of my life trying to scrub the remains of an omelet out of this thing. Why is the surface pebbly? Why does Lodge say to wash with soap and water and a scrubber? I have two 25-year-old 10"" Lodge skillets, smooth as glass, that I clean with a paper towel dampened with hot water and one cheap smooth-as-glass 6"" cast iron skillet from Taiwan that I clean the same way. What is this pebbly-surfaced, omelet-hugging, scrub-sponge-needing, whatever-seasoning-was-on-there-is-now-long-gone thing that I bought?!?"
"I just tested out my new Lodge 6.5” cast iron frying pan.  I bought this little frying pan because I want to use it for a camping trip I’m planning. I I have experimented with my camping menu and have discovered that although freeze dried foods like Mountain House, Alpine Aire, etc., are good for many things, the problem is with eggs. Freeze dried eggs simply don’t cut it. That’s why I bought this little cast iron frying pan, because eggs need to be cooked on the spot. As I will only need to prepare single servings for myself, this 6.5” size seemed to be the answer.  So, I started by seasoning my new pan. Martha Stewart recommends using Crisco shortening to season the pan. She says that a vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature works best, so, trusting Martha, that’s what I used. Here’s how I did it. 1) I thoroughly washed the new pan with hot water and dish washing detergent. 2) Dried the pan thoroughly by wiping it off and then by placing it for several minutes in a preheated oven at 200°. 3) Coated the pan thoroughly with Crisco (including the handle). 4) Placed the pan upside down on the middle oven rack and heated it to 450° for one hour. 5) Allowed the pan to cool down for one and a half hours.  Now to cook an experimental breakfast! I have read reviews that eggs will stick! (Extra cleaning chores are inconvenient on a camping trip)  I decided to begin with two slices of Spam. The 6.5” pan size will hold exactly two slices of Spam……...so far, so good. And it cooked them just fine in a little margarine. Now for the eggs. I was curious to find out if the 6.5” size would handle 3 eggs; scrambled. A little more margarine into the pan, then pour them (pre-mixed up) into the pan. This little pan EASILY handles 3 eggs! And as I scrambled them in the pan I could see that the pan seasoning was doing it’s job very well. NO sticking! Excellent! Clean up was a breeze. Don’t wash cast iron in water! Just wipe it out and then re-oil it with a bit more Crisco.  Bottomline; mission accomplished! This little cast iron skillet works perfectly for my intended purpose. To cook up a quick breakfast of a couple slices of Spam and 3 scrambled eggs. And then to clean up without effort..........very happy!"
"I love this thing! I'm a recent convert to cast iron cooking. As everyone said if you don't over clean it and just cook crap off it before you use it they work well and non-stick. I'm really impressed with how much better the food tastes. Shocked really. All my cooking is now cast iron. Somebody needs to make a cast iron Foreman style grill! I'll buy that in a second.  Anyway, weighs a ton like it should. Cooks great. The rubber pad thing is helpful but collects grease inside so wash that out a lot. Don't wash the pan a lot though. Just heat and spatula scraping and it is more non-stick than the non stick pans they sell."
"My first iron skillet, and I regret not buying one SOONER! I've realized Teflon pans is a product of good marketing. Why? Certain things are better cooked in high heat such as Meats, steak, sausages, breakfast meats to get the charred marks and High heat COOKS MUCH FASTER. High heat destroys Teflon pans but most cooking I usually use high heat. So, that's why people tend to destroy Teflon Pans, but here's the marketing... Teflon cleans easier. That's the biggest bunch of baloney, just so people will think they can clean faster. But guess what? Meats cook FASTER in iron skillet. So while you SAVE time washing none stick pans, you SAVE a lot of time cooking meats in an iron skillet. And by cooking in High Heat, people destroy Teflon pans that they have to replace $$$ over and over and over again. That said, Teflon has it's benefits. I would use anything that can be cooked in medium heat on Teflon pans.  In conclusion, I would use Teflon for things like eggs, omelettes, cheese, where you only need medium heat to cook.  I am now ONLY going to use Iron Skillet pans for any kind of meat cooking, stews, stir fry, that requires High heat cooking, and I will NEVER have to replace another Teflon pan again."
"BACK STORY: For many hikers, who enjoy cooking in the outdoors there is a general pain with the stainless steel mess kits, I went through the same. It's almost impossible not to burn the pan as it doesn't distribute heat well enough. There is a trick you can do with oil to prep them that works well, but it of course takes more time and the underside of the pan will still burn and have to be cleaned. I switched to the anodized, which works better in comparison with no prep needed. However, the cast iron is a step beyond. It heats just as you would expect and is a great even cook and takes less heat to get results. The only minimal challenges are:  1) you need a pot holder or sleeve for the handle, it gets real hot. 2) you need a pot holder square glove to store it if you plan to hike after, as it will still be hot. 3) the weight, but the 3.5 inch is quite lite and if you have ultra-light gear already, this is not much of an impact.  These three things are fine with me for the cooking results. Thus far, I've test cooked drop-biscuits, eggs, cookies and fish cakes, all with amazing results (see pictures). I'm cooking with isobutane on an MSR pocket rocket. We are becoming fast-friends and I will be eating well on the trail for years to come! I just love it! Thank you Lodge for a great product!"
"I never used a cast iron pan before but I had a couple of recipes I wanted to try that required one. Taking the pan out of the box I wondered if I had made a mistake because it is so different from other types of pans I'm used to. Even though the pan is well seasoned at the factory I followed the directions for seasoning myself and then promptly used it. Wow, It's great. I not only used it to make the baby dutch pancakes and cornbread I got it for but now I'm using for many other things too. If you eat meat there is no better way to cook a steak than to sear it in this pan and finish the cooking in a preheated oven. Cleaning it is easy as the seasoning really makes it a non-stick pan. The handle actually works well with the pan even though it looks too short."
"I bought a cast iron grill press a couple years ago that my husband and I use often. We've thought about getting a skillet as well. After doing a little bit of comparison shopping, I decided on this one from Lodge.  Couldn't wait to try it out as soon as it came. Directions on use and care are clear, with some extra info found on their website online. This one says it comes preseasoned. Still, I was hesitant to get right into it. Husband wasn't though. Our first meal with it tasted delicious. Even cooking. Nothing stuck to the skillet. Clean up was easy enough. And, it's ready to go for the next meal.  We like it so much, we decided to go ahead and get the mini skillet to try a single egg and such."
"Picked up this little 8"" skillet after finally throwing in the towel on non-stick pans altogether. I figured with enough diligent seasoning I could make this my designated omelette pan. Well, imagine my surprise when I rushed things a bit and decided to test-fry an egg after only two coats of seasoning and that sucker slid around like it was on black ice!  I know some people advocate sanding down Lodge's rugged finish, but, I have several pieces and have never found this to be necessary. You want at least a little texture to help that seasoning cling. FWIW, this one didn't have any egregious burrs or pits on the interior surface, so perhaps that had something to do with it, but I must have amazing luck, because 2-4 coats of extra virgin coconut oil seasoning oven-baked on high heat has worked for all five of my pieces (3 skillets & 2 dutch ovens), making them ready for anything. Even eggs and fish!  Oh, and yeah, this thing is perfect for a flawlessly executed 2-egg omelette with some gloriously crispy edges. I couldn't be happier!  Now if only I loved Lodge's Carbon Steel pans as much..."
"This is a great little cast-iron skillet. It heats evenly and quickly, and cleans up beautifully. The food doesn't stick to it at all. I just seasoned it before using it the first time; and then, after each use, season it again with either olive or vegetable oil after washing and drying it. Seasoning, for those who are new to this, is just putting a small amount of oil inside the pan and spreading it around with a paper towel or napkin to give it a light coating...that's it. The cast iron is fine on your Corelle cook top; it does not scratch or damage the cook top; I know because that is the cook top I have. This 6-1/2 inch size is perfect for 1 or 2 eggs, a toasted cheese sandwich, a pork chop, etc., or for cooking and sauteing things to be added to other dishes you may be preparing. I couldn't be happier with this Lodge iron skillet. I bought this small size to give cooking with an iron skillet a try, and now I am sold on them. I plan to buy another in the 10"" or larger size but will only buy the Lodge because it has proven to be great for me. There is a hint of iron taste at first, but that is one of the reasons for an iron skillet - adding iron to your diet. That taste has dissipated with use, though, but you still have that iron added to your food. Price: Amazon always has the best prices. I don't think this is returnable though. You may want to check that if you prefer that option. At the price I paid as an add-on item of a little over $8, I wasn't concerned about that. Happy I bought it."
"I bought the 10.25 inch pan on 5/15/2019 and it’s 11/27 today. I’ve never owned cast iron before, wasn’t too sure it it was worth all the trouble people made it sound like. But I love very crispy breakfast potatoes, and I’ve destroyed non-stick and ceramic pans because of it, and everything just sticks to stainless steel horribly. So I tried this and I’m glad I did. The best trick I can tell you is, start with low heat, and stay there. Just accept it’s going to take a while to cook. I have a gas stove and medium is too high to cook with this thing, food always gets burnt, but medium-low is perfect. And don’t wash it. I use it at least once a week and all I ever do is pour a little more oil in after the food is done, leave it over the hot burner, wipe out the oil and food bits into the trash when it’s cool, wipe with more oil if there’s still food bits left, and store it in the oven so it doesn’t get dusty. That’s it. It’s been great. The only time I use water and soap on it is if it gets gross and sticky (you’ll know when) and don’t scrub it that much, make sure it’s completely dry with paper towels, reheat it with oil, cool and wipe again with oil, and store it with more dry paper towels. Oh and I bought a bunch of stuff with this that I thought I needed to take care of it (cast iron plastic scrappers, chain mail scrubber, silicone gloves) you don’t need any of it. The chain mail was kind of cool but I’ve used it maybe 3 times. And two regular cloth pot holders are enough to touch the handle."
"I ordered this 13.25 inch Lodge skillet when it was on sale, and I'm glad I have it! I have a 12-inch burner on my stove, and this skillet fits just right. The 13.25 inch measure is across the top, and the sides slope inward so the bottom is 12 inches. If you don't have a 12 inch burner, this is not the skillet for you - it will not heat properly on a smaller burner. The first time I used it, there were several spots where my steel spatula snagged against little bumps on the cooking surface. I took some 150 grit emery paper on a sanding block and sanded the bottom of the skillet for about 10 minutes. I ended up with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dust that I washed out, then generously oiled the skillet. The next time I used it, the bottom seemed smoother, but not completely smooth like my old Wagner ware. My spatula no longer snags anywhere. Because of the size and weight of this pan, I leave it on the stovetop most of the time. If I have to move it, I put it on a rack next to the stove, so I don't take a chance of chipping my granite counter with it. I have to lift it with both hands. I use it as a frying pan for breaded chicken and pork chops, as well as a griddle for pancakes, quesadillas, french toast, bacon, fried eggs, and anything else you can think of. I'm looking forward to when we can have a party again, and plan to bake a humongous cornbread in it! Bacon and sausage often leave residue stuck to the bottom, so to clean it I will pour in about a cup of water while it's hot, then take it to the sink while still warm, and run hot water into it and scrub with a brush. I put a dishcloth or dishtowel on the sink divider to protect it from scratches, and rest the skillet on that while washing. No soap is needed most of the time. Just don't leave it until it gets completely cold! Wipe it dry, and use a paper towel to spread a little oil over the cooking surface. Put it on the rack to completely dry. Now I just have to figure out who gets it in my will!"
"After reading some of the negative reviews it's clear some folks don't know how to properly use and care for nonstick hard-anodized skillets. Never cook on high for any reason. You'll extend the life of your pan 10x by following that simple guideline. Also, always wait for the pan to thoroughly cool down before washing. Subjecting the pan to extreme temperature changes will warp the metal. Always wash with a soft sponge and never use brushes or scrub pads because the surface could get scratched. This also applies to spoons or spatulas, only use non-scratch utensils. I often just use a paper towel to wipe out the pan after cooking. That's just another way to cut down on the wear and tear. =]"
"I should give this a 1 star rating, for the stupidity of the company to GLUE a sticker, onto the middle of the pan! 😠 Think about that for a minute. A non stick surface, that you are instructed to use special care, in order to not scratch it's surface. Took me 3 hours to get the GLUE off! After soaking it in hot soapy water, I used white vinegar on a paper towel, and rubbed it off. THIS PAN BETTER LAST A LONG TIME! UPDATE: After using this pan, I was amazed at how great it is! I have never had a non stick pan that worked this well. THIS IS TRULY NON STICK ! Plus, It generates heat evenly. Great for making omelettes. Effortless cleaning. I still wish they hadn't put a sticker on the cooking part of the pan. But I love the pan !"
"All of the reviews written about how great this pan is must have written them straight after unboxing. I was also a huge fan - and used this piece daily - until....today. Suddenly it is NOT nonstick. Eggs, even bacon, just fused to the pan. I loved this thing and treated it like gold - followed the included instructions to the letter. I was even going to recommend on my cooking blog. Glad I waited because that would’ve been a spectacular retraction. What a disappointment from a mainstay and supposedly quality brand."
"We have owned other Cuisinart pans for a long time and have been happy. But this pan doesn't hold up at all. Its only been 4 months, it shows wear and tear plus it appear to rust after each hand wash. Anyways, I gave their customer service a call, and rep gave me instruction on how to write an email to them. Which I followed, no email respond within 2 months even with 2 additional follow up emails. Finally today I got an email from them saying, ""please change your email subject from cookware to COOKWARE, otherwise expect a delay"". Really??? I don't want to deal with this crap therefore I am just gonna throw away the pan. I hope people who do care about customers service experience will see my review and stay from this brand. Or at least do you own research wether if it's worthwhile to buy from them, there are a lot of complaints out there saying they don't stand behind their products and promises. I am disappointed."
"I have been using this pan for nearly two years. Before March 2020, on average, I used the pan for about five times a week. Since March, due to the pandemic, I have been using this pan twice a day every day. The picture is what looks like after two years of use. Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase, and I am ordering the same replacement although the current price is about one-third more than what I paid for the pan around two years ago.  The pan is durable for a nonstick pan. I have not encountered issues such as the uneven bottom after extended use. I suspect these issues are more likely if you overheat the pan.  The nonstick coating does wear off after two years of use, as seen in the picture. For most food, such as vegetable, poultry, and even eggs, the pan does not stick if you put enough oil in the pan. For seafood such as salmon (not the skin), it does stick, but the stuck residuals can be easily cleaned by deglazing them with water). I suspect that I would have been able to use the pan for an even more extended period had I not been so impatient that I used a steel scrubber to clean the pan for a few times."
"I am big fan of Cuisinart products. This is my second purchase for Cuisinart crepe pan. The thickness and size is perfect for crepes. What i loved about this pan is that its not flimsy or thin. Its super heavy duty stuff, yet easy on hands.  The handle is made of solid stainless steel which stay cool on the stovetop. I have been using this forever, and never had any issues with handle getting loose. Since there is no plastic part, the pan is over safe too.  The first one i bought, i made mistake of using steel utensils on it. I would recommend using wooden or silicon utensils on it, if you want to keep it in good health.  There are many pics available for this pan on internet. So, adding pics for reference. Hope it will help.  You can not go wrong with this pan. Highly recommended!!  **If you found this review at all helpful, please take a minute to let me know by clicking the button saying this review was helpful to you. I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users. Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions."
"Very disappointed that Cuisinart is misrepresenting this is ""hard anodized"" when the pan is all scratched after 4 weeks of use. It's never been touched by any metallic utensil. I'm guessing that any meat that has a bone is sufficient to scratch this poorly manufactured frying pan !  I would definitely look at something different as this pan's surface is obviously not what it is represented to be and/or is defective!"
"I, want my pans to do 3 things. Cook things evenly/well, clean up easily and look nice; especially when entertaining family and friends. I got the same style in all of their sizes offered. 8, 10, 12 and 14 (14s a monster and love it) . They clean up easy and cooking with them is spot on. HOWEVER, the underside base turns nasty looking very fast. I don’t put my pans in the dishwasher. So, I don’t know why these pans are looking so bad. I called Cuisinart Custer care and just got rudeness, and not listened to. Just talked over me non stop. ( Looks aren’t part of the warrenty) is all she kept saying. I can’t be the only one with this issue. I’m so dedicated to Cuisinart, I don’t even look at other products, like I take pride in them and it saddens me when the product is poorly made and they don’t want to hear it or help a loyal customer. The two middle photos are the four pans of this style, the 8, 10, 12 and 14 inch. All less than 6 months old, crazy. I have items from Cuisinart that’s 20 years old that look bran new ! Major let down from buying to customer care."
"After trying very many alternatives that were greener, I came back to this pen knowing full well that the chemicals are questionable.  It’s been a few months, mostly make morning eggs in it, never put it beyond medium, very light spray of olive oil (though when I forget it still works) cleaning is a breeze. Working as well as it did on day one. There is no nonstick that is going to last forever, but this one’s already doing much better than previous ceramic or greener coatings out there (had an expensive ceramic pan by the 2 name German company that didn’t even make it to six months). This is a hand wash only product as well.  I did my research, concluded that this was relatively safe if it doesn’t get to high temperatures, cheaper than most, still slick and slippery non-sticky."
had the same pan that I bought 2 years ago and worked great on a gas stovetop. We moved and now have an electric stove top and it got all scratched up. Decided to get a new one. After a month of use the new one looked as beat up as the first one! Don't know what the problem is? maybe the material is not meant for an electric stovetop!?
"This is a $200 set I had to get a replacement for the first set that was sent for defects in the pans/coating. Should have known and just got a different set all together. I don't even own a metal utensil and have never used a fork or spoon on my pans. Here are pics of 2 pans I haven't used and a pan I use 3 days per week since owning it for 2 months. Cuisinart claims it has quantanium coating which is resistant to metal utensils. Well it scratches using plastic utensils. Also the coating is already discolored and scratched after 2 months, and looks pretty awful next to a pan I haven't used (maybe 2-3uses). I have only washed with a soft sponge. I wipe the most used pans with a thin layer of oil (seasoning) once a week. I read the instructions and have done nothing out of the ordinary. I should add another pic with closeups of the scratches.. grr.. Would never buy this set again. Lowest rating I've ever put on Amazon since I've been shopping here (years). I love the amount of pieces and what pieces the set offers which is why I went with it. Should have went with Calphalon and less pieces or tfal maybe. Disappointed  Update: Its now been 3 months, I've added additional photos. The last one is the cuisinart pan next to a wearever pan I got at Walmart 3 years ago. The nonstick coating on my pan looks rusted. Do not buy this product. I use an electric stove and have never used heat over 6 out of 10 (medium heat) as instructed by cuisinart. I've never used metal utensils or cleaned the pan with a ""scratchy"" brush. I'm amazed how poor this non stick coating is. Purchased Dec 1st 2017 its March 28th 2018.. The last 2 pictures show my most used pants condition (3-4 times/week). Time to buy new pans and give these to a friend in need of donate to charity. Angry  PS: I do want to note that Amazon's customer service is top notch. They have always taken care of issues I've had. Unfortunately this set is poor quality and now I have to invest in another set. My most used pan looks rusted and i don't feel safe using it."
"Amazon removed my first review because they said they thought my review claimed the Cuisinart pan was a knock-off and they found that it was original Cuisinart. This made my review misleading to others. Amazon is in error. Let me be clear about this pan. It is made by Cuisinart. Cuisinart’s quality and value has dropped to the level of cheap Chinese knock-offs. This pan is single sheet stamped thin, weak and flimsy and worth about $12.95. While Cuisinart used to be a name that represented value and quality cookware, it now seems to deliver knock off quality at legit prices. If an item says Cuisinart on the product, you would be better off buying a cheap knock off at a knock off price instead of paying for the name and getting crap. Cuisinart will most likely complain about this posting and they will ask Amazon to remove it as well. Amazon?"
"I love this little pan! I had my first one for years before finally replacing it. As with any nonstick cookware, the enamel does start to wear after a lot of use, but this pan gets near daily use and lasted for years before I was no longer happy with the cooking surface. The perfect size for cooking 2 eggs over easy (it's most common job in our household) but is also a good size to saute up veggies for 1, toast nuts, or cook other small quantities. Great non-stick coating, and a great size to add to your collection."
"This is my new favorite pan to cook with. It hearts up quickly and evenly and is completely non-stick. So far I've used to on med-high settings for eggs, bacon, sausage and quesadillas. Yesterday I set the heat on low and slow cooked some beef teriyaki. I'm finding I don't even need to use oil or butter, everything I cook in in slides right off the surface. I love the angle and curve at the lip that allows easy flipping of items I'm cooking. Cleanup is a breeze as well, only needs to be rinsed and run over with a soapy sponge. I have been making a point of drying it with a dish towel right after washing it, rather than allowing it to drip dry in the dishrack. The handle on the lid can get hot, but other than that, this pan is pretty much perfect!"
"The item I received had clearly been used and returned. Unfortunately, I was on vacation when it arrived and didn't open the box until after my return window closed.  See photos. The item was clearly used heavily. There are burned in oil marks on the entire bottom and side of the pan. It looks like rust on the screws that hold the handle on. The pan coating is seriously scuffed from what I can see.  I get that Amazon has a generous return policy, but this item should have been taken as a loss and not restocked. The person who had it clearly kept the cover and opened it only slightly so they could use it and then return it."
"This pan is a great workhorse, used virtually every day for breakfast, and sometimes lunch. It heats quickly and evenly on our electric cooktop, has excellent balance, NEVER sticks to ANYTHING, and wipes clean with a paper towel. Love the gently flared sides that allow a spatula to get under the omelets, sautés or grilled cheeses with ease. We have its 12"" big brother and use it for almost anything needed for larger meals. Pretty tough coating, too - hard to scratch it unless you use metal utensils."
"I purchased these for myself to replace a set of Cuisinart cookware that I had owned for about nine years, which I thought was pretty impressive. I compared a lot of different ones, looking at reviews, prices, Consumer Reports, etc., and this seemed to be the best. Unfortunately, I am not very happy with this set.  First, the good: - These are nice and heavy, and seem to conduct heat well. - There are lots of different-sized pans, so you can use the right one for the right application. - They're nice looking.  Now the bad: - The nonstick coating doesn't seem to be very durable. I only use wood or plastic utensils when I cook, and the pots and pans are already showing scratches (I've only owned them for a month or so.) - Speaking of the nonstick coating, it doesn't work all that well. I have to scrub reasonably hard to get food off of them. - The handles are too small for heavy pans like these. That makes them rather awkward to hold. - The handles on the lids get really hot, to the point where you have to lift them wearing potholders. - This set doesn't include a good, deep 4-qt saucepan. (It does have a dutch oven, but the diameter isn't right for sauteing a bunch of items.) The 3.5-qt saucepan just isn't quite deep enough, and so there is a lot of splatter.  In sum, if it weren't such a pain to pack all this up and ship it back, I would return this set in a heartbeat."
"I purchased this pan as an exact replacement in my set, which I had for at least 5 years. The teflon coating had gone bad.  This pan arrive in what appeared to be perfect condition. I cooked on it once, electric stove and hand washed it. When it dried I was surprised by the bottom of the pan. It was all chalky. I washed it again but it is still the same. I already threw the packaging away otherwise I would return it. Perhaps I got a defect. I am afraid to use it as I dont trust what it's made out of."
"This is, by far, my new favorite piece of cookware!  This Cuisinart griddle is a dream! While not as heavy as cast iron, it’s obviously quality material and construction. The griddle heats evenly so there isn’t any portions partially cooked. It cools quickly, and easily cleaned.  I like to prepare make-ahead breakfasts. I can now whip up double the amount of pancakes in far less time. Today, I fried 36 pancakes in less than 30 minutes. In the past, it would take an hour to make half that amount in a skillet. I’ve e also used to to prepare multiple quesadillas. Previously, in my largest skillet, I could only prepare two at a time. Now I can make 4-6 at once.  When I purchased a new stove a few years ago, it came with a cast iron griddle. However, it’s heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to clean. Plus, I have to wait a long time for it to fully cool in order to clean it."
This pan has been wonderful. Easy to clean and I use it literally ever day. Why the Three Stars? Easy. I agree its not the most expensive pan. Cuisinart has always been a go to for me for value and quality. This particular pan has in the last two months gone from total non stick to everything sticks. It may be due to the bump that has arisen in the middle of the pan. The entire flat surface of the bottom of the pan now has a shallow dome shape. A side effect is that the pan if I move it it slides off the burner. Like you do when your stirring the food or making scrambled eggs. I figured there was at least a year warranty on this item. Its only been 8 months. So heads up. This may be a disposable item. For 6 months it was my go to pan!!
"It is a great size, and is non-stick, but after 3 uses it warped badly. I have a glass surface stovetop. I used low to medium heat, let it cool naturally, and now it is mostly worthless for eggs because they all run off the pan. For Cuisinart, it is a real disappointment."
"We purchased several sizes of Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick skillet pans. They all work very well, easy to clean, cook evenly and seem to hold up to use well. I will follow up on this review after we have used the skillets to see if the durability is really 5 stars. We would recommend these skillets."
"I can't rate this pan for making crepes ..I'm not a crepe maker ... I bought it for making omelets because of the lower sides making it easier to get a spatula under the egg and flip it over ...Works great ... I usually put a little olive oil in my own , best it up and add egg mixture ...First thing I noticed was that not even the olive oil stuck to the pan ...it beaded up ... It was almost a waste of time using oil ... Works great ..I've used it almost every day for the last two months ..most of the time I just wipe it out with a paper towel ..about every 3-4 days I'll wash it out ... No deterioration in performance after 2 months of constant use .. Tried eggs with no oil ..no problem ...Omelets with no oil ..no problem ... The highest setting U use is medium on my electric stove , and I use silicon or wood utensils ( I never use metal utensils, only in my cast iron...no matter what manufacturers claim) Good stuff ...shopping for skillets right now"
"This is an incredibly versatile and durable set. I'm amazed at how superlative it is. There are a few nice features, like measuring lines on the sides of some of the utensils, the glass tops, and the ease of use (think, ergonomic design). The ONLY complaint, and it's really not a complaint, but a warning, DO NOT WASH IN DISHWASHER. It will ruin the outside coating. The point of this set is its non-stick properties, meaning, you can wash it easily by hand. Otherwise, it's the best."
"I bought this just 4 months back. Handled very carefully. Used only for roti and dosa. Followed cleaning instructions as mentioned. To my surprise, the coating has been removed from the middle. I have attached the photo of it. Very bad experience. Bought it as it is best seller on amazon. Betrayed by the description. Please do not waste your hard earned money."
"There are no cons to this huge, fabulously deep sauté pan. I cant believe how much it holds. It even has the amount in cups and litres on the inside of the pan. It's so easy to clean and it will go into the oven without a lid up to 500°F. and with a lid up to 350°F. They recommend wooden or silicon tools, metal tools are well tolerated. Just don't use a habd mixer, whisk, or knife on it. I love the two handles which makes a heavy filled pot easy to transfer. I'm buying my son and daughter one for Christmas! What a good deal!"
"I have tried many nonstick pans and they all wear out eventually. This one has lasted 2+ years, which is double what I have gotten with other pans. I use a glass top halogen burner cooktop and the pan heats evenly. The rolled edge on the rim helps prevent drips down the side when pouring. Tips for longevity in any nonstick are to never clean in dishwasher even if it says dishwasher safe, never use metal utensils even if it says they are safe, and never preheat the pan on high because temperatures above 500 degrees damage the nonstick surface. Only con would be no helper handle for pouring. For the price I have not used better but have paid more for worse pans. The attached pic is the wear after about 2 1/2 years and the nonstick properties are starting to degrade. Time to replace."
"We needed a replacement for a giada brand teflon pan that we frequently use. My husband does the cooking and noticed that the teflon was beginning to wear, so I handed him my phone and told him to buy a pan that he liked. He is very meticulous and particular about what he wants, so i just let him search. After about 30 minutes of reviewing a few different pans, he chose this one. He liked that it had a large surface area, thick wall (width/how tall the pan was) that the material would not flake like teflon, seemed sturdy and would heat evenly. The pan arrived to our house quickly and after examining it, he was very happy with the quality. I had been a little worried that the handle would prevent us from storing it with our other pans (too wide for the shelf we have) but it turned out to fit just fine. We washed it and used it that night to make a penne spaghetti dish. He was happy with how it performed. Note: the pan says that it can withstand metal utensils, but for anything coated we just don't believe that - I saw another review where a chef said that His whisk scratched the pan. We've scratched other pans before so we just simply refrain from using metal utensils (my husband prefers wood and other materials anyway)."
"Terrible quality. Outside wears off almost immediately leaving a powder coating that will ruin anything even remotely porous you wash with this. This is great if you enjoy consuming toxic metals.  Toxicity aside, the overall build quality is atrocious. It's an all around poor quality product. In general I highly recommend steering clear of Cuisineart products 2019 and on as they've become a bottom tier distributor of relabeled Chinese relabeled crap."
Do not buy! This warped after about a month of use and since we are outside the Amazon return window we'll have to pay about as much to ship it to the manufacturer and back as it originally cost us to purchase from Amazon.
"I chose this grill pan for below reasons:  (1) 12"" pan is just the right size to cook for a small family (2) 12"" pan: I can get a same size lid easily; luckily I have an existing one at home (3) quick grill cooking without using my BBQ grill that requires lots of clean up (4) ease of cleaning: just put it in a dish washer if you wish. I often hand washed cos it is faster and I can use the pan the next day (5) oven safe: should you decide to put it in the oven to get the grill lines, you can do that because the handle is metal, not plastic.  I do hope that the pan is 1cm taller to prevent splattering everywhere. But since I have a lid (not included in the product), I cover it, works for me.  Tips: After washing (esp. hand wash), there might be residual oil (trapped between the grill lines), use a kitchen towel to wipe it clean before next use.  I strive to write meaningful reviews and hope this review is helpful for you. Happy shopping."
"This set is complete! The steamer works with several size sauce pans. You'll find that the pans are little heavier than other sets, but then remember you have three layers of metal that make up this cookware.  Please remember to wash the pans in warm water first to remove any tiny debris. No need to use the scratchy side of a dish sponge to clean up with, the pans almost wash themselves with a bit of detergent and some warm water.  I highly recommend the CUISINART set of cooking utensils with this set or at least the use of non-metal utensils to avoid scratching the bottoms of the pans They are tough and scratch resistant, but they can be marred over time.  You can actually make pancakes with out oil or spraying the pan first, and they don't even hint at sticking. These pans are so easy to clean with just a soft sponge and some hot water and detergent. They heat to temperature quickly and evenly.  One thing though that I found out the hard way is that the handles do tend to get a bit warm on the stove top depending on how long you are cooking an item. Simmered stews will get hotter than heating up a can of soup or vegetables, so have the oven mitts handy.  I am only sorry I waited so long to get this set. You will not be disappointed!"
"I have owned this pot for 11 years, and I really love it. It is a versatile size, can cook pasta, soup, veggies, matzo balls, you name it. It's easy to clean, and the non-stick finish has held up very well. It's not too heavy for my not-very-strong wrists, and the loop handle helps a lot. The shape is like a saucier, rounded and somewhat squat, which is good for almost everything except one recipe when I have to boil sugar and cream and allow it to foam up quite high. The glass lid has held up perfectly well also. I would definitely buy this pot again, and the price is right too."
"This is my fourth purchase of this saucepan - not a replacement but because I often batch cook and needed another one so I can have multiple pans going on the stove! It's a perfect weight - not flimsy but not so heavy that I strain to lift it - even when full. Simmers sauces beautifully, wonderful for small batches of various soups, and the perfect size for a big bowlful of popcorn, freshly popped with our favorite variety of toppings. The glass lid is a nice fit - tight when needed but easily ajar when you want things to simmer without spatters everywhere. Simple to clean and a breeze to swish with a bit of Dawn detergent and hot water. I simply love this pan and can't say enough good things about it!!"
"This review is not just a review for the Cuisinart 622-24 10"" Non Stick Skillet I purchased on Amazon for $25.95, but also of the Cuisinart 10"" Non Stick Skillet purchased from TJ Max that looks almost identical with part number 6622-24PP for $16.99 before tax. We've had an older 622-24 for several years now (over 5) and my wife wanted to get a new one because the old one had been scratched up enough that the non stick coating wasn't working as good as it once did, plus she just likes things that look new. I first went to TJ Max because sometimes you can get good stuff there for much less and found the pan that looked identical, but with a different part number on the pan. I wanted to see how different the cheaper pan from TJ Max was and bought it for comparison, but will be returning that pan because the one with part number 622-24 to me seems like a better pan and worth the extra $9. Just looking at them side by side you can't tell a difference, but when I weighed them the 622-24 pan purchased on Amazon was a little heavier. (34.53 oz versus 32.35 oz) The 622-24 seems like it is also just a smidge thicker when looking at them side by side. The main thing I noticed was the pan from Amazon has a label on the pan itself that says Quantanium which is supposed to be a premium coating so you can use metal utensils with the skillet. The one from TJ Max doesn't say that or has the sticker. The packaging sleeve with all the marketing material is similar and goes over all the same features, but have different presentations. The main Title difference is the 622-24 has ""Chef's"" in the title were the other does not which I'm assuming is because of the added Quantanium coating and reason the pan is a little over 2 oz more in weight. So now that you know that lets talk about the 622-24 pan performance. It has been a trusted skillet we've used for over 5 years and has impressed us enough to purchase another one to replace the one we use all the time nearly every day. I contemplated trying the new Ninja Cookware, but it is more money and figured I'd stay with what we know and what we've used for years so we don't have to change our cooking routines. We still use the old pan, but not for delicate items or items were we think it will be difficult to clean afterwards. The nonstick coating holds up well, but the pan will scratch over time despite the Quantanium marketing addition. The pan has a nice weight and look to it, but not as nice as other higher priced pans. Heat distribution is good too and will evenly cook an egg quickly and evenly. I do believe the cheaper pan from TJ Max will do just as good, but may not last as long. That is strictly my opinion though as I haven't cooked with it. I did want to add one more thing regarding my purchase on Amazon for the 622-24 pan I purchased. When it came in it had a scratch on the side rim of the non stick coating. Considering it will likley get a scratch like that in the future I decided to keep it instead of requesting a replacement, but did contact customer service and they were willing to give me a small discount on the pan because of the scratch which I am very appreciative of and also why I try to purchase everything from Amazon, because their customer service is really second to none in that respect. Well over 95% of the time they have met or went above my expectations with any issue I've ever had with anything. The key is to report it to them as quickly as possible. Hope this review helped someone and gave many the difference between the two pans because beforehand I couldn't find any info on the 6622-24PP skillet from TJ Max. Thanks!"
"This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase. I have been making recipes in portions for 4-5 people that typically seemed to contain too much stuff for my 10-inch frying pans, and I had to resort to using a wok, which is just more of a pain to use and clean. This Cuisinart pan is very easy to clean, has a long, sturdy handle, and a good cover, if needed. And it has been perfect for the amount of ingredients that I’ve needed for my recipes."
"Perfect saucepan! Nothing sticks and it cleans out easily. When you have those moments where you walked away to ""quickly"" go to the bathroom or ""quickly"" do something else and somehow got distracted or forgot and you came back to the kitchen full of smoke with the food burning........... guess what? You won't have to throw this pan out. Admittedly, I used to use stainless steal only and was always multi-tasking and every once in awhile, I burned a ban so badly that no amount of soaking or scrubbing could clean the stainless steal off and I had to discard my pan. BUT NOW WITH THIS ONE, I DON'T THINK THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN AGAIN! SO FAR, I LOVE IT! PS I was NOT paid for this review. I have no clue how people get free products in return for their free reviews. In my case, I paid for this product and am freely sharing my opinion. :)"
"I love this pan! After realizing I was too late for Easter brunch reservations I decided to prepare my own. On the menu- Swedish pancakes (a slightly thicker crepe), mind you I have never made them only eaten them. I decided I had better try making these Saturday in case it takes practice and I have to run back to the store for more ingredients. I used my sister in laws old family recipe she gave me 25 years ago and I never tried until now. 3 eggs, 3/4 c flour 3/4 c milk, 1 tbsp sugar- that’s it! The pan is the perfect size not too big, not too small. 2 small ladles of batter and swirl around in pan to edges, as soon as the batter looks dry- flip it over with one of the wooden spatulas also sold on amazon. They came out perfect! Really, you would think I had been making these for years. So thrilled to try many variations now! Anyone can do these with this pan and the spatula."
"This the absolute worst product! DO NOT BUY THESE PANS! These pans were purchased on Amazon for a Christmas present and the picture represents just one wash. The pot had not been used yet but was placed in the picture for comparison. Because it was a Christmas present this was not discovered within the return timeline on amazon but when I reached out to Cuisinart they took weeks to get back to me after calling , emailing and finally getting back to me after posting these pictures on social media. When they did get back to me they flat out denied the warranty because they said it was put in the dishwasher. I was not aware the pans couldn't go in the dishwasher. Who wants pans that cant go in the dishwasher?? That's like buying clothes that you can't put in the washing machine. What a complete waste of money!"
I bought this and the smaller 8 inch skillet. These are perfect pans.and I use them almost every day. Over a year later and they look almost new. I use metal utensils and cook omelets at least once a week with no sticking. I simply wash them immediately with warm soapy water and dry. The only thing that could be better is if they had matching lids. That is the only problem.  I had some Green Pans that were gifted to me and those only lasted about 3 months before everything would stick and burn. I will never purchase a Green Pan or a ceramic coated pan again. Green wouldn't honor their lifetime warranty and accused me of abusing the pans.
"Every morning, I use an 8 inch saute pan to cook an egg for breakfast. Normally, I would buy a new one at my local supermarket when one wore out or started ""sticking"". All of the cheaper pans have only one set-screw holding the handle, and right when you flick your wrist to turn the egg, the handle gets loose and the pan turns sideways... nope! This handle is truly double-riveted so it can't turn. Watch out because several cheaper brands look like they have double rivets, but there's one screw below the handle which indicates that the pan will start turning and can't be tightened enough to stop it. You get what you pay for and this pan is not much more than some of the el-cheapos out there. BTW- the egg slides around easily and is very easy to flip without using a spatula."
"After 42 years of making homemade shells ( crespelle) for our Italian American homemade manicotti in a 12 inch wonderfully heavy cast iron pan for Christmas, I gave myself this perfect pan. It is just too tiring to lift and swirl my heirloom cast iron pan anymore in my left hand to make the numerous shells required for this beloved family dish. Tradition is important, but my mother in law Nona Josephine is cackling in heaven calling me names in Italian wondering why in the cooking hell didn’t I get this pan decades sooner…she is not wrong! So grateful to her for teaching this non Italian daughter in law how to make her specialty ♥️🙏🏽♥️😘"
"I am not a scientist, but the non-stick coating of this line of pans from Cuisinart is superior to any we have owned. AND the pans can be used with metal utensils. That's not to say you can't do intentional damage to it if your are over-zealous, but no other pan that I know of offers this bonus. Also the curvature is perfect for working with eggs then sliding them out of the pan and onto the plate.  Our first one of these lasted forever (15+ years?). So now we have two 8-inchers that we interchange and use daily. Also you also don't really have to wash them; a double cleaning with paper towels does the trick."
"I'm not a pro or anything, but this pan has been really handy the few months I've had it. It's pretty heavy and I do agree with a review that the handle could be heftier, BUT I don't exactly move my pan around the place alot, so it doesn't cause me much trouble there. Also, I hand wash the pan, so I can't vouch how good it is in the dish washer Cause of how deep the pan is, it's great for frying or just anything that might splatter alot. I also use it as a wok to cook fried rice all the time. (Don't have room or money for one) Overall, I'm quite happy to have bought it."
"I have owned SEVERAL Pampered Chef 14"" pans; loved the pans dearly but eventually either the interior deteriorated or the handle broke/split off. I purchased several other pans (including pot and pan SET(S), a fancy cobalt blue wok pan, etc.) in attempt to replace my beloved Pampered Chef pan to no avail. This particular however has FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS (even though it's 12"" vs. my original 14"" pan size). I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS PAN!!!"
"I was looking for a decent frying pan for my smoothtop stove that conducts heat evenly; something that can brown foods - mostly, one that can brown chops and steaks. I was having alot of troubles doing that on my smoothtop with anything but a similar pan I have that was too small for more than one chop or steak.. My other pans don't seem to conduct heat evenly or do it very slowly on my stove; and, I was leaning 2-1/2 # weights against the sides to get the stove to feel the pan!?! This pan has worked perfectly and has replaced my Wok and my other pans that weren't working out so well. It also worked great for bacon and eggs. It browns easily and distributes heat evenly on my stove. Hooray! Finally an all around great pan on this temperamental stove! Just make sure you don't put these kinds of pans in the dishwasher. They last forever if you don't scratch them with metal utensils or put them in the dishwasher."
I have purchased three sets of the 7 piece cookware set after haven't bought a 12-inch skillet I like the fact that they are teflon infused with titanium. One for myself and two as Christmas gifts so far this it's the best cookware set I have ever owned. Even though it says you can use metal utensils on this cookware I would not recommend this on any kind of regular basis I did with the 10-inch skillet and I do regret this due to the fact that the codeine have flaked after 2 years of constant use. The other pieces in this set I have not used metal utensils on and they are still in good condition. I have learned my lesson and I'm going to replace the 10-inch skillet but will not be using metal utensils on it. Even though it says that you can use this sat in the oven at 500 degrees my neighbor recommend that you do not go over 400 degrees also the lid for the stock pot also fits the 10-inch skillet. Other then the 10-inch skillet this set of cookware has lasted longer then any other that I have owned. Other non-stick cookware that I have owned never lasted more than six months to one year. My neighbor and I definitely recommend the Cuisinart cookware.
"We had a pot made from this brand that is rounded. We have a super newer glass cook surface convection oven insert, but in less than a year we've noticed several scratches in the surface. The prior stove (same kind of glass surface) never scratched in 24 years. So we reviewed our skillets, and realized one high-quality heavy aluminum 11 inch pan had sharp edged rim on contact with the cook surface. If I let the pan tilt even slightly while using it, risked scratching the glass. The pan in review is totally smooth so like the pot, no chance of scratching, and even pan-fried low-fat meat, cooked with no oils, cleaned up nicely with a soft plastic scrub pad. Rated for 500 degree oven use is good, but we don't typically use pans in the oven (the lid is only rated for 350 degrees so be careful). We may alter some of our cooking of casserole-style dishes now that I realize/think the possibilities, where I could eliminate using an extra glass dish in the oven stage of cooking. Hmmm. We are careful to only use silicon and wooden spatulas/spoons/etc so I don't know how resistant the inside surface is to scratching. I'm glad I bought this pan and would buy it again."
"My husband purchased this set for me in 2012 as a ""we moved across the globe, here's something familiar"" present. It was my daily cookware set while we lived on land for two years. We then moved onto a boat and I started cooking professionally with it for week long sailing charters (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner, and dessert every day). It's been another two years and I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases he's ever made. We hand wash (no dishwasher) and are careful about using plastic/silicone utensils, but that's about where the careful line ends. I beat the ever loving crap out of these pots and pans and have only just noticed the non-stick starting to come away from a few spots in my pots. That being said, I replaced the 10-inch skillet after the first two years with a 12-inch (needed bigger for the boat) and have since replaced the 12-inch every year as I use it so often that the non-stick capability eventually gums up and it's time for a new one. I have a gas range and use the skillet with a high heat flame, under the broiler, in the oven, you name it on a multiple-times-daily basis. Seriously, I can't rave enough about how durable these things have been. Be careful though, I have found that the ""Chef's Classic"" line has much better non-stick durability than the ""GreenGourmet"" version - that 12-inch skillet gummed up after only a two months of heavy duty use."
"I have previously written a negative review about how the non-stick coating was bubbling up on the bottom of the pot.  Guess what? it turned out to be some residue from me cooking rice in the pot. I was able to scratch the residue off with a finger nail. I hand washed the pot so apparently this residue remained in the bottom of the pot for some reason somehow and it looked just like the non-stick coating was bubbling up and peeling off.  I am amazed at how the spots in the bottom of the pot really did look like the non-stick coating was bubbling and peeling off. My wife thought it was bubbling up and peeling off, I thought it was bubbling up and peeling off, and the pictures I had posted looked very convincing. the spots turned out to be nothing but little spots of starch from rice. Oops.  Slight LoL on my behalf."
"This is really a great pan that I was hesitant to buy it because of all of the reviews of warping. I may be premature, but we haven’t had that issue. We use it about once a week, mostly for pancakes, but I’ve also cooked eggs and flank steak. Heat distribution is great for pancakes and I haven’t had an issue with eggs or batter rolling down the sides. I only use a medium heat setting and hand wash after it’s completely cooled, so fingers crossed thats prevented any warping issues. Considering I was planning on spending three times this for the all clad version at William Sonoma, this is a pretty great deal. Plus if I do have any issues, I’ve had good success with Cuisinarts customer service and there is a limited lifetime warranty on this pan."
"I purchased the 14 piece set at a very good price ($117). This cookware is almost perfect, and at the price I paid, a good value. The stainless steel handles are riveted to the hard anodized aluminum pans, giving them a very professional look and feel. (I am a classically trained French Chef). The best thing about this set is the QuanTanium nonstick coating. It is four layers thick, reinforced by bits of Titanium. That being said, I would like to offer some suggestions, as I have been using parts of this set for years, and therefore have some good experience. First of all, don't run them through your dishwasher as this may cause some discoloration of the hard anodized aluminum surface. Second, don't drop them, as they may become deformed if dropped on a hard surface. Third, even though they are promoted as being able to stand up to metal utensils, I wouldn't use them. Ever. When it comes to any nonstick surface, it is best to ""baby"" them: Don't use them for high temperature searing (use cast iron instead), hand wash them, and use nylon, bamboo, wood, or silicone utensils. I use a silicone sponge and brush for cleaning while they are still hot."
"I waited almost a year to write my reveiw.After reading all the reviews I almost didn't buy these pots,but I'm so glad I did.I use these pots every day and have used every pots a few times each,some a lot of times.They work as well now as they did the day I got them.I use on a glass top stove and have never had any problems with food sticking or anything else.I would definitely buy again."
"These are great quality and I have had no issues with discoloration or scratches. And I got them when they were on sale for $128. Bonus! I see these pictures that others post and can immediately say they are setting the stove up way too high and burning oil into the coating and burning the coating as well. I used to do this same thing and was upset with a $500 cookware set until I learned that valuable lesson. Start lower, and after putting the food in bring the temp up. If you want something for searing at high heat then use cast iron or stainless. And do NOT put these in the dishwasher or any non-stick pan in. The alkali in the detergents will react with the coating and the aluminum."
"These have the only legitimate non-stick surface I've ever found - and I've tried a long list of name brands over a period of many years. Cuisinart actually tells you in the instructions that you don't need to use oil or butter unless you want it for the flavor and it's 100% true - I've successfully fried eggs over-easy with nothing in the pan but the eggs!! The surface of the pans looks amazing and the instructions say you can use metal utensils but I see no reason to do so because I want these to last the longest possible time. I've read reviews that mention the outside of the pan being difficult to clean but that is not my experience. Washing them once they've cooled down keeps them like new. I love to cook and these have added to my enjoyment. Thank you cuisinart! Btw, I cook on a GE glass-top stove (came with the apartment) and I bought the ""Chef's Classic"" 11 piece set. I highly recommend these and I think you'll consider the price to be an amazing value the first time you use them."
"I tried three popular 12 inch fry pans with 2 and 3 ply bottoms and none had a level cooking surface. The center is raised which causes cooking oil to pool around the sides while the center has no oil. I even tried the expensive all clad stainless steel fry pan with non stick coating and a 2 or 3 ply bottom. My thoughts were that at $195 it had to be perfect. Not so, cooking surface is basically the same as the others, raised in the center with oil pooling around the outside. Promptly returned. My emails to vendors customer service were not returned.  The Cuisinart fry pan is reasonably priced and I have used it on high heat to sear steaks, etc. No warping and the cooking surface is still level. This is an anodized aluminum fry pan with a very reasonable cost. I can trash several of these before I exceed the cost of the All Clad pan."
I needed the 12-inch skillet with a lid. I bought this skillet because of the fact that it was teflon infused with titanium it says that metal utensils on it I would not recommend that you use metal utensils on this with any frequency. The first time I used I was amazed how clean it got with minimum effort. My neighbor needed a large skillet I lent him this one and he just loved it. I have purchased three of the skillet between 2014 and 2015. 1 for myself and two as gifts for Christmas. One of which it's for the above-mentioned neighbor who uses it on a regular basis in the oven and he's told me that this is the best Skillet he has ever had the only thing he have ever said he would not recommend going over 375 or 400 degrees even though it states that you can go up to 500 Degrees. Me and people that I have bought ask Christmas gifts definitely recommend.
"this pan was dented pretty good around the lip upon opening. the ups guys around here love to kick the snot out of stuff, so that's no surprise. the guy dropped it off in front of my daughter who had just watched me pound out a dent with a rubber mallet. she looked at me and i knew she wanted me to try it so i did.  the dent pounded right out, no damage appeared to be present on the nonstick surface or rim, so there was no need to contact amazon or return it. we've used it several times now and i especially like the lid. i haven't been used to using a nonstick unit with a lid, but it seems to help make certain foods a tad easier. eggs especially.  this is a good buy in terms of quality compared to the tfal junk we've used in the past and hopefully it'll last a while. i told me daughter it was ok to scold mommy for using stainless spatulas on it, since that is how our last pan bit the dust... ;)"
"WORST PAN EVER! It arrived yesterday and I unwrapped and inspected it this morning. It looked beautiful and I washed it with warm soapy water before first use as suggested. Then I fried one egg on it and used a plastic spatula to flip the egg (and it stuck bad!). After use, I went to wash it and the bottom had multiple scratches on it already! I thought the scratches must have already been there before I used it and I just didn’t notice. To test, I used the same plastic spatula and LIGHTLY moved it across the bottom of the pan. It scratched immediately every place I touched it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"Four years after purchase, this little pan is still my go to. I’ve made crepes in this pan maybe two or three times, but this morning I used it, again, to make grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches, not to mention frequent use for quesadillas (the medium size tortillas fit perfectly). To make breakfast sandwiches, grill two slices of bread or hamburger rolls in the pan; put them aside then cook meat and eggs (together, in the same pan). This pan shows no signs of giving up — yes, the backside is blotchy, but that is my fault for not washing well enough. Giving any of your teflon pans a long life means hand washing only and use teflon coated spatulas."
"Cuisinart does not disappoint! I already have this pot and decided to buy another to keep on hand before they discontinue it like they do so many of their cookware pieces. It cooks fabulous, doesn't burn, cleans up like a breeze, is a nice weight and holds up for years! It is my favorite pan to cook with because of the size. I also have the 3 1/2 qt but find it too small for certain dinners I make, so I just switch up to the larger one. I only wish I could find this with both helper handles instead of the longer handle for ease of handling and storing. Otheriwse I have not one complaint about this pan and highly recommend. You can't go wrong with this baby - or the price on Amazon!! T"
"Do not buy this pan! It looks great coming out of the box. It cooks great and the food doesn't stick...problem is, it scratches very easily. I cooked chicken breasts with a soft silicone spatula. After I was done cooking, I cleaned the pan and noticed scratch marks when I had turned the chicken over in the pan. the next day, I saluted some mushrooms using a nylon spatula. Again, when cleaning the pan, I noticed new swirl marks that had been left by the nylon spatula. If the pan can't stand up to the soft kitchen tools I used, it won't be long before the pan is not Non-stick. Buy a Teflon pan, just not this brand. (Full disclosure. I have a stainless steel Cuisinart that I love. It is a great pan). Mike"
"I really like this wok! Easy to clean, good weight, lid fits perfectly. Not just for cooking stir fry. If there’s a con, there was a weird smell to the pan the first two times I used it but now it’s gone. Maybe, I should have seasoned it in the oven first? It’s not too late though.  Also, I recommend bamboo utensils when cooking with this pan to minimize scratches. I have to remind myself to “stir” the food when cooking, not scrape the pan.  I hope to get many years of use out of this wok. I highly recommend it and would definitely buy it again if the arises."
"This pan has been perfect for what we were looking for. Rice is kind of a staple in our home, so leftovers become stir fry about once a week. We had used a frying pan (deep chicken fryer type), but you can’t really flip with those, so we went on a hunt. Had to be large enough for 5 servings +, dishwasher safe, and nonstick. This one fit the bill, so we gave it a try. Now it’s in regular rotation for anything that needs sautéed. Green beans and garlic in EVOO, pasta with lemon, kielbasa with fried potatoes? All cooked wonderfully in this pan. I’m thrilled with it."
"I bought this pan to supplement the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard Anodized 14-Piece Cookware Set that I recently purchased. The set is great but the largest pan it came with was only 10”. I definitely need something larger for when I’m cooking for more people, and this fits the bill. It’s the same exact brand and model so it fits in perfectly with that set. They must have corrected the issue with the sticking label that other commenters have noted, because it came off easily with no tearing. Yes, these pans do show “micro scratches” almost immediately upon use, but they come out of the packaging so perfectly shiny and sparkly that I think it’s inevitable. The scratches seem very superficial and the coating doesn’t appear to be compromised. I would avoid metal utensils to be safe."
"This saucepan was just the perfect size for my small kitchen. The pan has performed nicely as I've cooked sauces, boiled water, and warmed soup. There has been no sticking and it's an easy clean up as I just wash it in the dishwasher. The pan feel sturdy and feels like it will hold up to many years of use. The lid is also solid and fits perfectly on the pan."
"I love love love my skillet!!! I love the fact that I can cook a big meal, but I can put it in the oven too! THE ONLY THING TO REALLY BE CAREFUL OF IS WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE OVEN... PLEASE PLEASE BE CAREFUL .. THAT HANDLE IS HOTTER THAN BLAZES! I KNOW BC I BURNT A PART OF MY HAND. It's all better now tho.. so now when I pull it out I automatically put a hand glove hot pad over the handle.. As far as cooking and cleaning goes.. Wow!! Cooking is a breeze even tho I had to get used to it and the Clean Up.. was Fantastic!! And I don't have to soak it either!! Great skillet for the money and it will certainly pay for itself. I am hoping to have this one for many years to come and enjoy!!! Oh yeah, another thing.. the skillet came boxed by itself.. not much packaging materials or extra paper around it from sliding in the box, but nothing broke and all was ok..... just wished they would have put extra paper around the skillet before shipping it off.. Other than that.. it's a 10!!"
"I've only been using these pans for several weeks. So far they are perfect !!! NO problems at all. Clean up easily, no scratches, cook evenly, handles don't over heat. Top handles can get a little hot but use caution and a hot pad if you are worried. I've used my stainless steel Cuisinart pans for over 20 years and they have worked fine and that's why is chose these Cuisinart non-stick as I trust the company."
"This griddle is just what I needed. Perfect for grill cheese sandwiches, pancakes, and hot dogs with toasted buns. Haven't tried veggies yet. Very easy to clean. Weight is perfect. I read reviews complaining about warping. I have not experience this. However, I find the best way to heat the griddle is to start with medium heat. When finished using, let it cool and don't dowse with cold water. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it. It's a great addition to my other pans/skillets."
"This has become my go to everyday pan for everything! I no longer use butter when frying eggs, the first time I used the pan was to fry tortilla's in avocado oil. I was in awe of the flavor in the tortillas, the other pans I had used had absorbed the oil, I had no idea that avocado oil tasted so good. I've since started using this pan to make omelets for breakfast. I had not made one in years because they would always fall apart in my other pans. After reading all the reviews here I take extra care of this pan. I wait for it to cool before washing it, use little to no dish soap, never put it in the dishwasher. Most days it only needs to be wiped clean. So far so good! I'll be add more sizes from this line up."
"After reading some of the negative reviews it's clear some folks don't know how to properly use and care for nonstick hard-anodized skillets. Never cook on high for any reason. You'll extend the life of your pan 10x by following that simple guideline. Also, always wait for the pan to thoroughly cool down before washing. Subjecting the pan to extreme temperature changes will warp the metal. Always wash with a soft sponge and never use brushes or scrub pads because the surface could get scratched. This also applies to spoons or spatulas, only use non-scratch utensils. I often just use a paper towel to wipe out the pan after cooking. That's just another way to cut down on the wear and tear. =]"
"I should give this a 1 star rating, for the stupidity of the company to GLUE a sticker, onto the middle of the pan! 😠 Think about that for a minute. A non stick surface, that you are instructed to use special care, in order to not scratch it's surface. Took me 3 hours to get the GLUE off! After soaking it in hot soapy water, I used white vinegar on a paper towel, and rubbed it off. THIS PAN BETTER LAST A LONG TIME! UPDATE: After using this pan, I was amazed at how great it is! I have never had a non stick pan that worked this well. THIS IS TRULY NON STICK ! Plus, It generates heat evenly. Great for making omelettes. Effortless cleaning. I still wish they hadn't put a sticker on the cooking part of the pan. But I love the pan !"
"All of the reviews written about how great this pan is must have written them straight after unboxing. I was also a huge fan - and used this piece daily - until....today. Suddenly it is NOT nonstick. Eggs, even bacon, just fused to the pan. I loved this thing and treated it like gold - followed the included instructions to the letter. I was even going to recommend on my cooking blog. Glad I waited because that would’ve been a spectacular retraction. What a disappointment from a mainstay and supposedly quality brand."
"We have owned other Cuisinart pans for a long time and have been happy. But this pan doesn't hold up at all. Its only been 4 months, it shows wear and tear plus it appear to rust after each hand wash. Anyways, I gave their customer service a call, and rep gave me instruction on how to write an email to them. Which I followed, no email respond within 2 months even with 2 additional follow up emails. Finally today I got an email from them saying, ""please change your email subject from cookware to COOKWARE, otherwise expect a delay"". Really??? I don't want to deal with this crap therefore I am just gonna throw away the pan. I hope people who do care about customers service experience will see my review and stay from this brand. Or at least do you own research wether if it's worthwhile to buy from them, there are a lot of complaints out there saying they don't stand behind their products and promises. I am disappointed."
"I have been using this pan for nearly two years. Before March 2020, on average, I used the pan for about five times a week. Since March, due to the pandemic, I have been using this pan twice a day every day. The picture is what looks like after two years of use. Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase, and I am ordering the same replacement although the current price is about one-third more than what I paid for the pan around two years ago.  The pan is durable for a nonstick pan. I have not encountered issues such as the uneven bottom after extended use. I suspect these issues are more likely if you overheat the pan.  The nonstick coating does wear off after two years of use, as seen in the picture. For most food, such as vegetable, poultry, and even eggs, the pan does not stick if you put enough oil in the pan. For seafood such as salmon (not the skin), it does stick, but the stuck residuals can be easily cleaned by deglazing them with water). I suspect that I would have been able to use the pan for an even more extended period had I not been so impatient that I used a steel scrubber to clean the pan for a few times."
"I am big fan of Cuisinart products. This is my second purchase for Cuisinart crepe pan. The thickness and size is perfect for crepes. What i loved about this pan is that its not flimsy or thin. Its super heavy duty stuff, yet easy on hands.  The handle is made of solid stainless steel which stay cool on the stovetop. I have been using this forever, and never had any issues with handle getting loose. Since there is no plastic part, the pan is over safe too.  The first one i bought, i made mistake of using steel utensils on it. I would recommend using wooden or silicon utensils on it, if you want to keep it in good health.  There are many pics available for this pan on internet. So, adding pics for reference. Hope it will help.  You can not go wrong with this pan. Highly recommended!!  **If you found this review at all helpful, please take a minute to let me know by clicking the button saying this review was helpful to you. I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users. Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions."
"Very disappointed that Cuisinart is misrepresenting this is ""hard anodized"" when the pan is all scratched after 4 weeks of use. It's never been touched by any metallic utensil. I'm guessing that any meat that has a bone is sufficient to scratch this poorly manufactured frying pan !  I would definitely look at something different as this pan's surface is obviously not what it is represented to be and/or is defective!"
"I, want my pans to do 3 things. Cook things evenly/well, clean up easily and look nice; especially when entertaining family and friends. I got the same style in all of their sizes offered. 8, 10, 12 and 14 (14s a monster and love it) . They clean up easy and cooking with them is spot on. HOWEVER, the underside base turns nasty looking very fast. I don’t put my pans in the dishwasher. So, I don’t know why these pans are looking so bad. I called Cuisinart Custer care and just got rudeness, and not listened to. Just talked over me non stop. ( Looks aren’t part of the warrenty) is all she kept saying. I can’t be the only one with this issue. I’m so dedicated to Cuisinart, I don’t even look at other products, like I take pride in them and it saddens me when the product is poorly made and they don’t want to hear it or help a loyal customer. The two middle photos are the four pans of this style, the 8, 10, 12 and 14 inch. All less than 6 months old, crazy. I have items from Cuisinart that’s 20 years old that look bran new ! Major let down from buying to customer care."
"After trying very many alternatives that were greener, I came back to this pen knowing full well that the chemicals are questionable.  It’s been a few months, mostly make morning eggs in it, never put it beyond medium, very light spray of olive oil (though when I forget it still works) cleaning is a breeze. Working as well as it did on day one. There is no nonstick that is going to last forever, but this one’s already doing much better than previous ceramic or greener coatings out there (had an expensive ceramic pan by the 2 name German company that didn’t even make it to six months). This is a hand wash only product as well.  I did my research, concluded that this was relatively safe if it doesn’t get to high temperatures, cheaper than most, still slick and slippery non-sticky."
had the same pan that I bought 2 years ago and worked great on a gas stovetop. We moved and now have an electric stove top and it got all scratched up. Decided to get a new one. After a month of use the new one looked as beat up as the first one! Don't know what the problem is? maybe the material is not meant for an electric stovetop!?
"This is a $200 set I had to get a replacement for the first set that was sent for defects in the pans/coating. Should have known and just got a different set all together. I don't even own a metal utensil and have never used a fork or spoon on my pans. Here are pics of 2 pans I haven't used and a pan I use 3 days per week since owning it for 2 months. Cuisinart claims it has quantanium coating which is resistant to metal utensils. Well it scratches using plastic utensils. Also the coating is already discolored and scratched after 2 months, and looks pretty awful next to a pan I haven't used (maybe 2-3uses). I have only washed with a soft sponge. I wipe the most used pans with a thin layer of oil (seasoning) once a week. I read the instructions and have done nothing out of the ordinary. I should add another pic with closeups of the scratches.. grr.. Would never buy this set again. Lowest rating I've ever put on Amazon since I've been shopping here (years). I love the amount of pieces and what pieces the set offers which is why I went with it. Should have went with Calphalon and less pieces or tfal maybe. Disappointed  Update: Its now been 3 months, I've added additional photos. The last one is the cuisinart pan next to a wearever pan I got at Walmart 3 years ago. The nonstick coating on my pan looks rusted. Do not buy this product. I use an electric stove and have never used heat over 6 out of 10 (medium heat) as instructed by cuisinart. I've never used metal utensils or cleaned the pan with a ""scratchy"" brush. I'm amazed how poor this non stick coating is. Purchased Dec 1st 2017 its March 28th 2018.. The last 2 pictures show my most used pants condition (3-4 times/week). Time to buy new pans and give these to a friend in need of donate to charity. Angry  PS: I do want to note that Amazon's customer service is top notch. They have always taken care of issues I've had. Unfortunately this set is poor quality and now I have to invest in another set. My most used pan looks rusted and i don't feel safe using it."
"Amazon removed my first review because they said they thought my review claimed the Cuisinart pan was a knock-off and they found that it was original Cuisinart. This made my review misleading to others. Amazon is in error. Let me be clear about this pan. It is made by Cuisinart. Cuisinart’s quality and value has dropped to the level of cheap Chinese knock-offs. This pan is single sheet stamped thin, weak and flimsy and worth about $12.95. While Cuisinart used to be a name that represented value and quality cookware, it now seems to deliver knock off quality at legit prices. If an item says Cuisinart on the product, you would be better off buying a cheap knock off at a knock off price instead of paying for the name and getting crap. Cuisinart will most likely complain about this posting and they will ask Amazon to remove it as well. Amazon?"
"I love this little pan! I had my first one for years before finally replacing it. As with any nonstick cookware, the enamel does start to wear after a lot of use, but this pan gets near daily use and lasted for years before I was no longer happy with the cooking surface. The perfect size for cooking 2 eggs over easy (it's most common job in our household) but is also a good size to saute up veggies for 1, toast nuts, or cook other small quantities. Great non-stick coating, and a great size to add to your collection."
"This is my new favorite pan to cook with. It hearts up quickly and evenly and is completely non-stick. So far I've used to on med-high settings for eggs, bacon, sausage and quesadillas. Yesterday I set the heat on low and slow cooked some beef teriyaki. I'm finding I don't even need to use oil or butter, everything I cook in in slides right off the surface. I love the angle and curve at the lip that allows easy flipping of items I'm cooking. Cleanup is a breeze as well, only needs to be rinsed and run over with a soapy sponge. I have been making a point of drying it with a dish towel right after washing it, rather than allowing it to drip dry in the dishrack. The handle on the lid can get hot, but other than that, this pan is pretty much perfect!"
"The item I received had clearly been used and returned. Unfortunately, I was on vacation when it arrived and didn't open the box until after my return window closed.  See photos. The item was clearly used heavily. There are burned in oil marks on the entire bottom and side of the pan. It looks like rust on the screws that hold the handle on. The pan coating is seriously scuffed from what I can see.  I get that Amazon has a generous return policy, but this item should have been taken as a loss and not restocked. The person who had it clearly kept the cover and opened it only slightly so they could use it and then return it."
"This pan is a great workhorse, used virtually every day for breakfast, and sometimes lunch. It heats quickly and evenly on our electric cooktop, has excellent balance, NEVER sticks to ANYTHING, and wipes clean with a paper towel. Love the gently flared sides that allow a spatula to get under the omelets, sautés or grilled cheeses with ease. We have its 12"" big brother and use it for almost anything needed for larger meals. Pretty tough coating, too - hard to scratch it unless you use metal utensils."
"I purchased these for myself to replace a set of Cuisinart cookware that I had owned for about nine years, which I thought was pretty impressive. I compared a lot of different ones, looking at reviews, prices, Consumer Reports, etc., and this seemed to be the best. Unfortunately, I am not very happy with this set.  First, the good: - These are nice and heavy, and seem to conduct heat well. - There are lots of different-sized pans, so you can use the right one for the right application. - They're nice looking.  Now the bad: - The nonstick coating doesn't seem to be very durable. I only use wood or plastic utensils when I cook, and the pots and pans are already showing scratches (I've only owned them for a month or so.) - Speaking of the nonstick coating, it doesn't work all that well. I have to scrub reasonably hard to get food off of them. - The handles are too small for heavy pans like these. That makes them rather awkward to hold. - The handles on the lids get really hot, to the point where you have to lift them wearing potholders. - This set doesn't include a good, deep 4-qt saucepan. (It does have a dutch oven, but the diameter isn't right for sauteing a bunch of items.) The 3.5-qt saucepan just isn't quite deep enough, and so there is a lot of splatter.  In sum, if it weren't such a pain to pack all this up and ship it back, I would return this set in a heartbeat."
"I purchased this pan as an exact replacement in my set, which I had for at least 5 years. The teflon coating had gone bad.  This pan arrive in what appeared to be perfect condition. I cooked on it once, electric stove and hand washed it. When it dried I was surprised by the bottom of the pan. It was all chalky. I washed it again but it is still the same. I already threw the packaging away otherwise I would return it. Perhaps I got a defect. I am afraid to use it as I dont trust what it's made out of."
"This is, by far, my new favorite piece of cookware!  This Cuisinart griddle is a dream! While not as heavy as cast iron, it’s obviously quality material and construction. The griddle heats evenly so there isn’t any portions partially cooked. It cools quickly, and easily cleaned.  I like to prepare make-ahead breakfasts. I can now whip up double the amount of pancakes in far less time. Today, I fried 36 pancakes in less than 30 minutes. In the past, it would take an hour to make half that amount in a skillet. I’ve e also used to to prepare multiple quesadillas. Previously, in my largest skillet, I could only prepare two at a time. Now I can make 4-6 at once.  When I purchased a new stove a few years ago, it came with a cast iron griddle. However, it’s heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to clean. Plus, I have to wait a long time for it to fully cool in order to clean it."
This pan has been wonderful. Easy to clean and I use it literally ever day. Why the Three Stars? Easy. I agree its not the most expensive pan. Cuisinart has always been a go to for me for value and quality. This particular pan has in the last two months gone from total non stick to everything sticks. It may be due to the bump that has arisen in the middle of the pan. The entire flat surface of the bottom of the pan now has a shallow dome shape. A side effect is that the pan if I move it it slides off the burner. Like you do when your stirring the food or making scrambled eggs. I figured there was at least a year warranty on this item. Its only been 8 months. So heads up. This may be a disposable item. For 6 months it was my go to pan!!
"It is a great size, and is non-stick, but after 3 uses it warped badly. I have a glass surface stovetop. I used low to medium heat, let it cool naturally, and now it is mostly worthless for eggs because they all run off the pan. For Cuisinart, it is a real disappointment."
"We purchased several sizes of Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick skillet pans. They all work very well, easy to clean, cook evenly and seem to hold up to use well. I will follow up on this review after we have used the skillets to see if the durability is really 5 stars. We would recommend these skillets."
"I can't rate this pan for making crepes ..I'm not a crepe maker ... I bought it for making omelets because of the lower sides making it easier to get a spatula under the egg and flip it over ...Works great ... I usually put a little olive oil in my own , best it up and add egg mixture ...First thing I noticed was that not even the olive oil stuck to the pan ...it beaded up ... It was almost a waste of time using oil ... Works great ..I've used it almost every day for the last two months ..most of the time I just wipe it out with a paper towel ..about every 3-4 days I'll wash it out ... No deterioration in performance after 2 months of constant use .. Tried eggs with no oil ..no problem ...Omelets with no oil ..no problem ... The highest setting U use is medium on my electric stove , and I use silicon or wood utensils ( I never use metal utensils, only in my cast iron...no matter what manufacturers claim) Good stuff ...shopping for skillets right now"
"This is an incredibly versatile and durable set. I'm amazed at how superlative it is. There are a few nice features, like measuring lines on the sides of some of the utensils, the glass tops, and the ease of use (think, ergonomic design). The ONLY complaint, and it's really not a complaint, but a warning, DO NOT WASH IN DISHWASHER. It will ruin the outside coating. The point of this set is its non-stick properties, meaning, you can wash it easily by hand. Otherwise, it's the best."
"I bought this just 4 months back. Handled very carefully. Used only for roti and dosa. Followed cleaning instructions as mentioned. To my surprise, the coating has been removed from the middle. I have attached the photo of it. Very bad experience. Bought it as it is best seller on amazon. Betrayed by the description. Please do not waste your hard earned money."
"There are no cons to this huge, fabulously deep sauté pan. I cant believe how much it holds. It even has the amount in cups and litres on the inside of the pan. It's so easy to clean and it will go into the oven without a lid up to 500°F. and with a lid up to 350°F. They recommend wooden or silicon tools, metal tools are well tolerated. Just don't use a habd mixer, whisk, or knife on it. I love the two handles which makes a heavy filled pot easy to transfer. I'm buying my son and daughter one for Christmas! What a good deal!"
"I have tried many nonstick pans and they all wear out eventually. This one has lasted 2+ years, which is double what I have gotten with other pans. I use a glass top halogen burner cooktop and the pan heats evenly. The rolled edge on the rim helps prevent drips down the side when pouring. Tips for longevity in any nonstick are to never clean in dishwasher even if it says dishwasher safe, never use metal utensils even if it says they are safe, and never preheat the pan on high because temperatures above 500 degrees damage the nonstick surface. Only con would be no helper handle for pouring. For the price I have not used better but have paid more for worse pans. The attached pic is the wear after about 2 1/2 years and the nonstick properties are starting to degrade. Time to replace."
"We needed a replacement for a giada brand teflon pan that we frequently use. My husband does the cooking and noticed that the teflon was beginning to wear, so I handed him my phone and told him to buy a pan that he liked. He is very meticulous and particular about what he wants, so i just let him search. After about 30 minutes of reviewing a few different pans, he chose this one. He liked that it had a large surface area, thick wall (width/how tall the pan was) that the material would not flake like teflon, seemed sturdy and would heat evenly. The pan arrived to our house quickly and after examining it, he was very happy with the quality. I had been a little worried that the handle would prevent us from storing it with our other pans (too wide for the shelf we have) but it turned out to fit just fine. We washed it and used it that night to make a penne spaghetti dish. He was happy with how it performed. Note: the pan says that it can withstand metal utensils, but for anything coated we just don't believe that - I saw another review where a chef said that His whisk scratched the pan. We've scratched other pans before so we just simply refrain from using metal utensils (my husband prefers wood and other materials anyway)."
"Terrible quality. Outside wears off almost immediately leaving a powder coating that will ruin anything even remotely porous you wash with this. This is great if you enjoy consuming toxic metals.  Toxicity aside, the overall build quality is atrocious. It's an all around poor quality product. In general I highly recommend steering clear of Cuisineart products 2019 and on as they've become a bottom tier distributor of relabeled Chinese relabeled crap."
Do not buy! This warped after about a month of use and since we are outside the Amazon return window we'll have to pay about as much to ship it to the manufacturer and back as it originally cost us to purchase from Amazon.
"I chose this grill pan for below reasons:  (1) 12"" pan is just the right size to cook for a small family (2) 12"" pan: I can get a same size lid easily; luckily I have an existing one at home (3) quick grill cooking without using my BBQ grill that requires lots of clean up (4) ease of cleaning: just put it in a dish washer if you wish. I often hand washed cos it is faster and I can use the pan the next day (5) oven safe: should you decide to put it in the oven to get the grill lines, you can do that because the handle is metal, not plastic.  I do hope that the pan is 1cm taller to prevent splattering everywhere. But since I have a lid (not included in the product), I cover it, works for me.  Tips: After washing (esp. hand wash), there might be residual oil (trapped between the grill lines), use a kitchen towel to wipe it clean before next use.  I strive to write meaningful reviews and hope this review is helpful for you. Happy shopping."
"This set is complete! The steamer works with several size sauce pans. You'll find that the pans are little heavier than other sets, but then remember you have three layers of metal that make up this cookware.  Please remember to wash the pans in warm water first to remove any tiny debris. No need to use the scratchy side of a dish sponge to clean up with, the pans almost wash themselves with a bit of detergent and some warm water.  I highly recommend the CUISINART set of cooking utensils with this set or at least the use of non-metal utensils to avoid scratching the bottoms of the pans They are tough and scratch resistant, but they can be marred over time.  You can actually make pancakes with out oil or spraying the pan first, and they don't even hint at sticking. These pans are so easy to clean with just a soft sponge and some hot water and detergent. They heat to temperature quickly and evenly.  One thing though that I found out the hard way is that the handles do tend to get a bit warm on the stove top depending on how long you are cooking an item. Simmered stews will get hotter than heating up a can of soup or vegetables, so have the oven mitts handy.  I am only sorry I waited so long to get this set. You will not be disappointed!"
"I have owned this pot for 11 years, and I really love it. It is a versatile size, can cook pasta, soup, veggies, matzo balls, you name it. It's easy to clean, and the non-stick finish has held up very well. It's not too heavy for my not-very-strong wrists, and the loop handle helps a lot. The shape is like a saucier, rounded and somewhat squat, which is good for almost everything except one recipe when I have to boil sugar and cream and allow it to foam up quite high. The glass lid has held up perfectly well also. I would definitely buy this pot again, and the price is right too."
"This is my fourth purchase of this saucepan - not a replacement but because I often batch cook and needed another one so I can have multiple pans going on the stove! It's a perfect weight - not flimsy but not so heavy that I strain to lift it - even when full. Simmers sauces beautifully, wonderful for small batches of various soups, and the perfect size for a big bowlful of popcorn, freshly popped with our favorite variety of toppings. The glass lid is a nice fit - tight when needed but easily ajar when you want things to simmer without spatters everywhere. Simple to clean and a breeze to swish with a bit of Dawn detergent and hot water. I simply love this pan and can't say enough good things about it!!"
"This review is not just a review for the Cuisinart 622-24 10"" Non Stick Skillet I purchased on Amazon for $25.95, but also of the Cuisinart 10"" Non Stick Skillet purchased from TJ Max that looks almost identical with part number 6622-24PP for $16.99 before tax. We've had an older 622-24 for several years now (over 5) and my wife wanted to get a new one because the old one had been scratched up enough that the non stick coating wasn't working as good as it once did, plus she just likes things that look new. I first went to TJ Max because sometimes you can get good stuff there for much less and found the pan that looked identical, but with a different part number on the pan. I wanted to see how different the cheaper pan from TJ Max was and bought it for comparison, but will be returning that pan because the one with part number 622-24 to me seems like a better pan and worth the extra $9. Just looking at them side by side you can't tell a difference, but when I weighed them the 622-24 pan purchased on Amazon was a little heavier. (34.53 oz versus 32.35 oz) The 622-24 seems like it is also just a smidge thicker when looking at them side by side. The main thing I noticed was the pan from Amazon has a label on the pan itself that says Quantanium which is supposed to be a premium coating so you can use metal utensils with the skillet. The one from TJ Max doesn't say that or has the sticker. The packaging sleeve with all the marketing material is similar and goes over all the same features, but have different presentations. The main Title difference is the 622-24 has ""Chef's"" in the title were the other does not which I'm assuming is because of the added Quantanium coating and reason the pan is a little over 2 oz more in weight. So now that you know that lets talk about the 622-24 pan performance. It has been a trusted skillet we've used for over 5 years and has impressed us enough to purchase another one to replace the one we use all the time nearly every day. I contemplated trying the new Ninja Cookware, but it is more money and figured I'd stay with what we know and what we've used for years so we don't have to change our cooking routines. We still use the old pan, but not for delicate items or items were we think it will be difficult to clean afterwards. The nonstick coating holds up well, but the pan will scratch over time despite the Quantanium marketing addition. The pan has a nice weight and look to it, but not as nice as other higher priced pans. Heat distribution is good too and will evenly cook an egg quickly and evenly. I do believe the cheaper pan from TJ Max will do just as good, but may not last as long. That is strictly my opinion though as I haven't cooked with it. I did want to add one more thing regarding my purchase on Amazon for the 622-24 pan I purchased. When it came in it had a scratch on the side rim of the non stick coating. Considering it will likley get a scratch like that in the future I decided to keep it instead of requesting a replacement, but did contact customer service and they were willing to give me a small discount on the pan because of the scratch which I am very appreciative of and also why I try to purchase everything from Amazon, because their customer service is really second to none in that respect. Well over 95% of the time they have met or went above my expectations with any issue I've ever had with anything. The key is to report it to them as quickly as possible. Hope this review helped someone and gave many the difference between the two pans because beforehand I couldn't find any info on the 6622-24PP skillet from TJ Max. Thanks!"
"This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase. I have been making recipes in portions for 4-5 people that typically seemed to contain too much stuff for my 10-inch frying pans, and I had to resort to using a wok, which is just more of a pain to use and clean. This Cuisinart pan is very easy to clean, has a long, sturdy handle, and a good cover, if needed. And it has been perfect for the amount of ingredients that I’ve needed for my recipes."
"Perfect saucepan! Nothing sticks and it cleans out easily. When you have those moments where you walked away to ""quickly"" go to the bathroom or ""quickly"" do something else and somehow got distracted or forgot and you came back to the kitchen full of smoke with the food burning........... guess what? You won't have to throw this pan out. Admittedly, I used to use stainless steal only and was always multi-tasking and every once in awhile, I burned a ban so badly that no amount of soaking or scrubbing could clean the stainless steal off and I had to discard my pan. BUT NOW WITH THIS ONE, I DON'T THINK THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN AGAIN! SO FAR, I LOVE IT! PS I was NOT paid for this review. I have no clue how people get free products in return for their free reviews. In my case, I paid for this product and am freely sharing my opinion. :)"
"I love this pan! After realizing I was too late for Easter brunch reservations I decided to prepare my own. On the menu- Swedish pancakes (a slightly thicker crepe), mind you I have never made them only eaten them. I decided I had better try making these Saturday in case it takes practice and I have to run back to the store for more ingredients. I used my sister in laws old family recipe she gave me 25 years ago and I never tried until now. 3 eggs, 3/4 c flour 3/4 c milk, 1 tbsp sugar- that’s it! The pan is the perfect size not too big, not too small. 2 small ladles of batter and swirl around in pan to edges, as soon as the batter looks dry- flip it over with one of the wooden spatulas also sold on amazon. They came out perfect! Really, you would think I had been making these for years. So thrilled to try many variations now! Anyone can do these with this pan and the spatula."
"This the absolute worst product! DO NOT BUY THESE PANS! These pans were purchased on Amazon for a Christmas present and the picture represents just one wash. The pot had not been used yet but was placed in the picture for comparison. Because it was a Christmas present this was not discovered within the return timeline on amazon but when I reached out to Cuisinart they took weeks to get back to me after calling , emailing and finally getting back to me after posting these pictures on social media. When they did get back to me they flat out denied the warranty because they said it was put in the dishwasher. I was not aware the pans couldn't go in the dishwasher. Who wants pans that cant go in the dishwasher?? That's like buying clothes that you can't put in the washing machine. What a complete waste of money!"
I bought this and the smaller 8 inch skillet. These are perfect pans.and I use them almost every day. Over a year later and they look almost new. I use metal utensils and cook omelets at least once a week with no sticking. I simply wash them immediately with warm soapy water and dry. The only thing that could be better is if they had matching lids. That is the only problem.  I had some Green Pans that were gifted to me and those only lasted about 3 months before everything would stick and burn. I will never purchase a Green Pan or a ceramic coated pan again. Green wouldn't honor their lifetime warranty and accused me of abusing the pans.
"Every morning, I use an 8 inch saute pan to cook an egg for breakfast. Normally, I would buy a new one at my local supermarket when one wore out or started ""sticking"". All of the cheaper pans have only one set-screw holding the handle, and right when you flick your wrist to turn the egg, the handle gets loose and the pan turns sideways... nope! This handle is truly double-riveted so it can't turn. Watch out because several cheaper brands look like they have double rivets, but there's one screw below the handle which indicates that the pan will start turning and can't be tightened enough to stop it. You get what you pay for and this pan is not much more than some of the el-cheapos out there. BTW- the egg slides around easily and is very easy to flip without using a spatula."
"After 42 years of making homemade shells ( crespelle) for our Italian American homemade manicotti in a 12 inch wonderfully heavy cast iron pan for Christmas, I gave myself this perfect pan. It is just too tiring to lift and swirl my heirloom cast iron pan anymore in my left hand to make the numerous shells required for this beloved family dish. Tradition is important, but my mother in law Nona Josephine is cackling in heaven calling me names in Italian wondering why in the cooking hell didn’t I get this pan decades sooner…she is not wrong! So grateful to her for teaching this non Italian daughter in law how to make her specialty ♥️🙏🏽♥️😘"
"I am not a scientist, but the non-stick coating of this line of pans from Cuisinart is superior to any we have owned. AND the pans can be used with metal utensils. That's not to say you can't do intentional damage to it if your are over-zealous, but no other pan that I know of offers this bonus. Also the curvature is perfect for working with eggs then sliding them out of the pan and onto the plate.  Our first one of these lasted forever (15+ years?). So now we have two 8-inchers that we interchange and use daily. Also you also don't really have to wash them; a double cleaning with paper towels does the trick."
"I'm not a pro or anything, but this pan has been really handy the few months I've had it. It's pretty heavy and I do agree with a review that the handle could be heftier, BUT I don't exactly move my pan around the place alot, so it doesn't cause me much trouble there. Also, I hand wash the pan, so I can't vouch how good it is in the dish washer Cause of how deep the pan is, it's great for frying or just anything that might splatter alot. I also use it as a wok to cook fried rice all the time. (Don't have room or money for one) Overall, I'm quite happy to have bought it."
"I have owned SEVERAL Pampered Chef 14"" pans; loved the pans dearly but eventually either the interior deteriorated or the handle broke/split off. I purchased several other pans (including pot and pan SET(S), a fancy cobalt blue wok pan, etc.) in attempt to replace my beloved Pampered Chef pan to no avail. This particular however has FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS (even though it's 12"" vs. my original 14"" pan size). I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS PAN!!!"
"I was looking for a decent frying pan for my smoothtop stove that conducts heat evenly; something that can brown foods - mostly, one that can brown chops and steaks. I was having alot of troubles doing that on my smoothtop with anything but a similar pan I have that was too small for more than one chop or steak.. My other pans don't seem to conduct heat evenly or do it very slowly on my stove; and, I was leaning 2-1/2 # weights against the sides to get the stove to feel the pan!?! This pan has worked perfectly and has replaced my Wok and my other pans that weren't working out so well. It also worked great for bacon and eggs. It browns easily and distributes heat evenly on my stove. Hooray! Finally an all around great pan on this temperamental stove! Just make sure you don't put these kinds of pans in the dishwasher. They last forever if you don't scratch them with metal utensils or put them in the dishwasher."
I have purchased three sets of the 7 piece cookware set after haven't bought a 12-inch skillet I like the fact that they are teflon infused with titanium. One for myself and two as Christmas gifts so far this it's the best cookware set I have ever owned. Even though it says you can use metal utensils on this cookware I would not recommend this on any kind of regular basis I did with the 10-inch skillet and I do regret this due to the fact that the codeine have flaked after 2 years of constant use. The other pieces in this set I have not used metal utensils on and they are still in good condition. I have learned my lesson and I'm going to replace the 10-inch skillet but will not be using metal utensils on it. Even though it says that you can use this sat in the oven at 500 degrees my neighbor recommend that you do not go over 400 degrees also the lid for the stock pot also fits the 10-inch skillet. Other then the 10-inch skillet this set of cookware has lasted longer then any other that I have owned. Other non-stick cookware that I have owned never lasted more than six months to one year. My neighbor and I definitely recommend the Cuisinart cookware.
"We had a pot made from this brand that is rounded. We have a super newer glass cook surface convection oven insert, but in less than a year we've noticed several scratches in the surface. The prior stove (same kind of glass surface) never scratched in 24 years. So we reviewed our skillets, and realized one high-quality heavy aluminum 11 inch pan had sharp edged rim on contact with the cook surface. If I let the pan tilt even slightly while using it, risked scratching the glass. The pan in review is totally smooth so like the pot, no chance of scratching, and even pan-fried low-fat meat, cooked with no oils, cleaned up nicely with a soft plastic scrub pad. Rated for 500 degree oven use is good, but we don't typically use pans in the oven (the lid is only rated for 350 degrees so be careful). We may alter some of our cooking of casserole-style dishes now that I realize/think the possibilities, where I could eliminate using an extra glass dish in the oven stage of cooking. Hmmm. We are careful to only use silicon and wooden spatulas/spoons/etc so I don't know how resistant the inside surface is to scratching. I'm glad I bought this pan and would buy it again."
"My husband purchased this set for me in 2012 as a ""we moved across the globe, here's something familiar"" present. It was my daily cookware set while we lived on land for two years. We then moved onto a boat and I started cooking professionally with it for week long sailing charters (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner, and dessert every day). It's been another two years and I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases he's ever made. We hand wash (no dishwasher) and are careful about using plastic/silicone utensils, but that's about where the careful line ends. I beat the ever loving crap out of these pots and pans and have only just noticed the non-stick starting to come away from a few spots in my pots. That being said, I replaced the 10-inch skillet after the first two years with a 12-inch (needed bigger for the boat) and have since replaced the 12-inch every year as I use it so often that the non-stick capability eventually gums up and it's time for a new one. I have a gas range and use the skillet with a high heat flame, under the broiler, in the oven, you name it on a multiple-times-daily basis. Seriously, I can't rave enough about how durable these things have been. Be careful though, I have found that the ""Chef's Classic"" line has much better non-stick durability than the ""GreenGourmet"" version - that 12-inch skillet gummed up after only a two months of heavy duty use."
"I have previously written a negative review about how the non-stick coating was bubbling up on the bottom of the pot.  Guess what? it turned out to be some residue from me cooking rice in the pot. I was able to scratch the residue off with a finger nail. I hand washed the pot so apparently this residue remained in the bottom of the pot for some reason somehow and it looked just like the non-stick coating was bubbling up and peeling off.  I am amazed at how the spots in the bottom of the pot really did look like the non-stick coating was bubbling and peeling off. My wife thought it was bubbling up and peeling off, I thought it was bubbling up and peeling off, and the pictures I had posted looked very convincing. the spots turned out to be nothing but little spots of starch from rice. Oops.  Slight LoL on my behalf."
"This is really a great pan that I was hesitant to buy it because of all of the reviews of warping. I may be premature, but we haven’t had that issue. We use it about once a week, mostly for pancakes, but I’ve also cooked eggs and flank steak. Heat distribution is great for pancakes and I haven’t had an issue with eggs or batter rolling down the sides. I only use a medium heat setting and hand wash after it’s completely cooled, so fingers crossed thats prevented any warping issues. Considering I was planning on spending three times this for the all clad version at William Sonoma, this is a pretty great deal. Plus if I do have any issues, I’ve had good success with Cuisinarts customer service and there is a limited lifetime warranty on this pan."
"I purchased the 14 piece set at a very good price ($117). This cookware is almost perfect, and at the price I paid, a good value. The stainless steel handles are riveted to the hard anodized aluminum pans, giving them a very professional look and feel. (I am a classically trained French Chef). The best thing about this set is the QuanTanium nonstick coating. It is four layers thick, reinforced by bits of Titanium. That being said, I would like to offer some suggestions, as I have been using parts of this set for years, and therefore have some good experience. First of all, don't run them through your dishwasher as this may cause some discoloration of the hard anodized aluminum surface. Second, don't drop them, as they may become deformed if dropped on a hard surface. Third, even though they are promoted as being able to stand up to metal utensils, I wouldn't use them. Ever. When it comes to any nonstick surface, it is best to ""baby"" them: Don't use them for high temperature searing (use cast iron instead), hand wash them, and use nylon, bamboo, wood, or silicone utensils. I use a silicone sponge and brush for cleaning while they are still hot."
"I waited almost a year to write my reveiw.After reading all the reviews I almost didn't buy these pots,but I'm so glad I did.I use these pots every day and have used every pots a few times each,some a lot of times.They work as well now as they did the day I got them.I use on a glass top stove and have never had any problems with food sticking or anything else.I would definitely buy again."
"These are great quality and I have had no issues with discoloration or scratches. And I got them when they were on sale for $128. Bonus! I see these pictures that others post and can immediately say they are setting the stove up way too high and burning oil into the coating and burning the coating as well. I used to do this same thing and was upset with a $500 cookware set until I learned that valuable lesson. Start lower, and after putting the food in bring the temp up. If you want something for searing at high heat then use cast iron or stainless. And do NOT put these in the dishwasher or any non-stick pan in. The alkali in the detergents will react with the coating and the aluminum."
"These have the only legitimate non-stick surface I've ever found - and I've tried a long list of name brands over a period of many years. Cuisinart actually tells you in the instructions that you don't need to use oil or butter unless you want it for the flavor and it's 100% true - I've successfully fried eggs over-easy with nothing in the pan but the eggs!! The surface of the pans looks amazing and the instructions say you can use metal utensils but I see no reason to do so because I want these to last the longest possible time. I've read reviews that mention the outside of the pan being difficult to clean but that is not my experience. Washing them once they've cooled down keeps them like new. I love to cook and these have added to my enjoyment. Thank you cuisinart! Btw, I cook on a GE glass-top stove (came with the apartment) and I bought the ""Chef's Classic"" 11 piece set. I highly recommend these and I think you'll consider the price to be an amazing value the first time you use them."
"I tried three popular 12 inch fry pans with 2 and 3 ply bottoms and none had a level cooking surface. The center is raised which causes cooking oil to pool around the sides while the center has no oil. I even tried the expensive all clad stainless steel fry pan with non stick coating and a 2 or 3 ply bottom. My thoughts were that at $195 it had to be perfect. Not so, cooking surface is basically the same as the others, raised in the center with oil pooling around the outside. Promptly returned. My emails to vendors customer service were not returned.  The Cuisinart fry pan is reasonably priced and I have used it on high heat to sear steaks, etc. No warping and the cooking surface is still level. This is an anodized aluminum fry pan with a very reasonable cost. I can trash several of these before I exceed the cost of the All Clad pan."
I needed the 12-inch skillet with a lid. I bought this skillet because of the fact that it was teflon infused with titanium it says that metal utensils on it I would not recommend that you use metal utensils on this with any frequency. The first time I used I was amazed how clean it got with minimum effort. My neighbor needed a large skillet I lent him this one and he just loved it. I have purchased three of the skillet between 2014 and 2015. 1 for myself and two as gifts for Christmas. One of which it's for the above-mentioned neighbor who uses it on a regular basis in the oven and he's told me that this is the best Skillet he has ever had the only thing he have ever said he would not recommend going over 375 or 400 degrees even though it states that you can go up to 500 Degrees. Me and people that I have bought ask Christmas gifts definitely recommend.
"this pan was dented pretty good around the lip upon opening. the ups guys around here love to kick the snot out of stuff, so that's no surprise. the guy dropped it off in front of my daughter who had just watched me pound out a dent with a rubber mallet. she looked at me and i knew she wanted me to try it so i did.  the dent pounded right out, no damage appeared to be present on the nonstick surface or rim, so there was no need to contact amazon or return it. we've used it several times now and i especially like the lid. i haven't been used to using a nonstick unit with a lid, but it seems to help make certain foods a tad easier. eggs especially.  this is a good buy in terms of quality compared to the tfal junk we've used in the past and hopefully it'll last a while. i told me daughter it was ok to scold mommy for using stainless spatulas on it, since that is how our last pan bit the dust... ;)"
"WORST PAN EVER! It arrived yesterday and I unwrapped and inspected it this morning. It looked beautiful and I washed it with warm soapy water before first use as suggested. Then I fried one egg on it and used a plastic spatula to flip the egg (and it stuck bad!). After use, I went to wash it and the bottom had multiple scratches on it already! I thought the scratches must have already been there before I used it and I just didn’t notice. To test, I used the same plastic spatula and LIGHTLY moved it across the bottom of the pan. It scratched immediately every place I touched it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"Four years after purchase, this little pan is still my go to. I’ve made crepes in this pan maybe two or three times, but this morning I used it, again, to make grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches, not to mention frequent use for quesadillas (the medium size tortillas fit perfectly). To make breakfast sandwiches, grill two slices of bread or hamburger rolls in the pan; put them aside then cook meat and eggs (together, in the same pan). This pan shows no signs of giving up — yes, the backside is blotchy, but that is my fault for not washing well enough. Giving any of your teflon pans a long life means hand washing only and use teflon coated spatulas."
"Cuisinart does not disappoint! I already have this pot and decided to buy another to keep on hand before they discontinue it like they do so many of their cookware pieces. It cooks fabulous, doesn't burn, cleans up like a breeze, is a nice weight and holds up for years! It is my favorite pan to cook with because of the size. I also have the 3 1/2 qt but find it too small for certain dinners I make, so I just switch up to the larger one. I only wish I could find this with both helper handles instead of the longer handle for ease of handling and storing. Otheriwse I have not one complaint about this pan and highly recommend. You can't go wrong with this baby - or the price on Amazon!! T"
"Do not buy this pan! It looks great coming out of the box. It cooks great and the food doesn't stick...problem is, it scratches very easily. I cooked chicken breasts with a soft silicone spatula. After I was done cooking, I cleaned the pan and noticed scratch marks when I had turned the chicken over in the pan. the next day, I saluted some mushrooms using a nylon spatula. Again, when cleaning the pan, I noticed new swirl marks that had been left by the nylon spatula. If the pan can't stand up to the soft kitchen tools I used, it won't be long before the pan is not Non-stick. Buy a Teflon pan, just not this brand. (Full disclosure. I have a stainless steel Cuisinart that I love. It is a great pan). Mike"
"I really like this wok! Easy to clean, good weight, lid fits perfectly. Not just for cooking stir fry. If there’s a con, there was a weird smell to the pan the first two times I used it but now it’s gone. Maybe, I should have seasoned it in the oven first? It’s not too late though.  Also, I recommend bamboo utensils when cooking with this pan to minimize scratches. I have to remind myself to “stir” the food when cooking, not scrape the pan.  I hope to get many years of use out of this wok. I highly recommend it and would definitely buy it again if the arises."
"This pan has been perfect for what we were looking for. Rice is kind of a staple in our home, so leftovers become stir fry about once a week. We had used a frying pan (deep chicken fryer type), but you can’t really flip with those, so we went on a hunt. Had to be large enough for 5 servings +, dishwasher safe, and nonstick. This one fit the bill, so we gave it a try. Now it’s in regular rotation for anything that needs sautéed. Green beans and garlic in EVOO, pasta with lemon, kielbasa with fried potatoes? All cooked wonderfully in this pan. I’m thrilled with it."
"I bought this pan to supplement the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard Anodized 14-Piece Cookware Set that I recently purchased. The set is great but the largest pan it came with was only 10”. I definitely need something larger for when I’m cooking for more people, and this fits the bill. It’s the same exact brand and model so it fits in perfectly with that set. They must have corrected the issue with the sticking label that other commenters have noted, because it came off easily with no tearing. Yes, these pans do show “micro scratches” almost immediately upon use, but they come out of the packaging so perfectly shiny and sparkly that I think it’s inevitable. The scratches seem very superficial and the coating doesn’t appear to be compromised. I would avoid metal utensils to be safe."
"This saucepan was just the perfect size for my small kitchen. The pan has performed nicely as I've cooked sauces, boiled water, and warmed soup. There has been no sticking and it's an easy clean up as I just wash it in the dishwasher. The pan feel sturdy and feels like it will hold up to many years of use. The lid is also solid and fits perfectly on the pan."
"I love love love my skillet!!! I love the fact that I can cook a big meal, but I can put it in the oven too! THE ONLY THING TO REALLY BE CAREFUL OF IS WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE OVEN... PLEASE PLEASE BE CAREFUL .. THAT HANDLE IS HOTTER THAN BLAZES! I KNOW BC I BURNT A PART OF MY HAND. It's all better now tho.. so now when I pull it out I automatically put a hand glove hot pad over the handle.. As far as cooking and cleaning goes.. Wow!! Cooking is a breeze even tho I had to get used to it and the Clean Up.. was Fantastic!! And I don't have to soak it either!! Great skillet for the money and it will certainly pay for itself. I am hoping to have this one for many years to come and enjoy!!! Oh yeah, another thing.. the skillet came boxed by itself.. not much packaging materials or extra paper around it from sliding in the box, but nothing broke and all was ok..... just wished they would have put extra paper around the skillet before shipping it off.. Other than that.. it's a 10!!"
"I've only been using these pans for several weeks. So far they are perfect !!! NO problems at all. Clean up easily, no scratches, cook evenly, handles don't over heat. Top handles can get a little hot but use caution and a hot pad if you are worried. I've used my stainless steel Cuisinart pans for over 20 years and they have worked fine and that's why is chose these Cuisinart non-stick as I trust the company."
"This griddle is just what I needed. Perfect for grill cheese sandwiches, pancakes, and hot dogs with toasted buns. Haven't tried veggies yet. Very easy to clean. Weight is perfect. I read reviews complaining about warping. I have not experience this. However, I find the best way to heat the griddle is to start with medium heat. When finished using, let it cool and don't dowse with cold water. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it. It's a great addition to my other pans/skillets."
"This has become my go to everyday pan for everything! I no longer use butter when frying eggs, the first time I used the pan was to fry tortilla's in avocado oil. I was in awe of the flavor in the tortillas, the other pans I had used had absorbed the oil, I had no idea that avocado oil tasted so good. I've since started using this pan to make omelets for breakfast. I had not made one in years because they would always fall apart in my other pans. After reading all the reviews here I take extra care of this pan. I wait for it to cool before washing it, use little to no dish soap, never put it in the dishwasher. Most days it only needs to be wiped clean. So far so good! I'll be add more sizes from this line up."
"Really liked using this pan for omelettes and making chapatis (considering its advertised even heat distribution. But with a few months, the non-stick layer has started showing these weird signs of wear and tear. I clean it with soap and sponge/wash cloth. Hardly ever put this in the dishwasher. Very disappointed considering I trusted T-Fal for their quality and reliability. - Amazon - I'd like to understand what are my options to return this item :( I cant risk my family's health considering faulty non-sticks are leading to released toxins in food and hence cancer in people."
"I bought this to replace E9380263 8"" T-fal frying pan that I had used daily for 3.5 years, only because the Teflon was showing some chips and not being sure if a problem was starting I thought it best to replace it.  I also have a 10"" T-fal, but I live alone and the 8"" usually meets my needs.  As it turned out, I am glad I did the replacement. This frying pan is a bit deeper, which is helpful in some situations, and a lid from another pan fits it perfectly. For me that is a definite plus.  I am have no hesitation about recommending this frying pan or a T-fal pan. I have been using T-fal 8"" and 10"" frying pans for about 7 years and have been well satisfied. When I need a frying pan I consider only those by T-fal. They are well made and the non-stick works well."
"I buy one of these about every year, but they will last longer if you are the only one to use it. You will use plastic spatulas. You will not heat past medium. You will not store it with metal pots stacked on the cooking surface. It may last forever, to keep the cockroaches company after all other life on Earth is destroyed.  But if you let others use your pan improperly (and they will,) it will last you a year or so, and at this price, that's a fair deal. Recommended."
"I bought a set of T-fal frying pans about 12 years ago. They have gotten a lot of use and were showing signs of wear. I decided to replace them with a new set (a 12"", two 10"", and this 8""). It's been a couple weeks but these replacement pans seem to perform just as well as those being replace (or better). If I get 12 years of heavy use from these I will be very happy."
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. ""Advanced"" & ""Nonstick"" indeed. Durability is a major issue for cookware, at least for folks raised with metal utensils and who slip occasionally on autopilot and mar a coated pan surface (blush.) These can be damaged, but even a modicum of care should have them lasting for years. (Our first is still in pristine condition - just ordered another to replace our Calphalon smooth-coated original 8-inch, whose interior is simply disappearing. For typical cooking of small quantities, the 8-inch are just right and two are often needed.) The pan is thick, and tends to come to uniform heat quickly. Non-stick is better by far than that of the typical smooth-coated pan. Having lived with one for a few years, this T-Fal design in all sizes will be our go-to for replacements should need arise. My wife occasionally loses her mind a cools a hot skillet with water - arrrgh - and this pan's relieved underside seems to withstand the abuse and not warp (whew!)"
"GREAT little pan! If you're looking for a slick/slippery inside surface this is a bit different as it has a more rough/bumpy interior BUT this means that even when I basted with a spoon, the metal on metal did not scratch the pan. And, it does live up to its promise of being non-stick. Very good quality."
"I have been buying Titanium T-fal series frypans since they came out. Unfortunately, the Titanium 8"" frypan I just received almost appears to be a cheap knockoff. It is very thin with a sparkly but very rough surface. If this represents their new Titanium series. it will be the last I purchase"
I have used it several times and its great. However if after months the surface comes off I have no way of knowing that and not sure if it will allow me to give another review after a period of months. Be sure the buy the lid which I did not since I have alot of the glass lids which I thought would fit since there about 3 main generic sizes but the 10.5 diameter is unusual so you should pay for the lid. I am 68 and the people that say the coating can come off I bet they were overheated or food got forgotten and burned dry. It is non stick however eggs dont slide around which I prefer they dont but you touch the eggs they fly right out. also the black color helps with heat--white or copper colored pans do not cook right and you can tell it. also the handle is light weight--it does not force the pan to tilt--such as pans where the eggs slide over to one side-it sits flat and with the rubbery handle you can pick it right up. The pan does not have a super thick stainless steel bottom like expensive pans but the benefit is its very light weight such as for picking it up also for moving where you dont load up a ton of cast iron. If people are older its hard to pick up a super heavy pan and exerts extreme force on the wrist this one dosent. BUT BUY THE LID. lid is specifically designed for the exact pan. you wont find one at goodwill.
"I have had this for several months. No high heat, to attempt to speed cook or anything. I cook what I think is a normal manner. I let the pan cool on its own before hitting it with water. It cleans easily, with no signs of deteriation. I am sure if I set my mind to it, I could destroy it, and write a bad review. I found long ago when you buy anything, and treat it like it should be treated it last for a long time. Yes, I forsee replacing it in a few years. Happens with all nonstick cooking products, otherwise they would come with lifetime warranties. I would easily suggest this to a friend."
I have always liked t-fal and when I was in need of an everyday skillet I knew t-fal would not disappoint unlike so many other more expensive brands. The non-stick coating on t-fal pans works best and lasts longer when used over a LOW FLAME or LOW HEAT. The heat indicator ring on the pan turns red to let you know when it’s hot enough to add the food. It’s dishwasher safe which is an added bonus because more expensive non-stick pans require hand washing.
"I'm a huge cast iron cookware person. However, cleaning eggs out is the one thing that always is terrible. I don't have the time to baby my cast iron into the perfect glassy smooth surface like some. Being able to do an egg that doesn't stick on my cast iron isn't one of my life goals. So I got one of these for me and one for my mom who's old Teflon pan was terrible.  Pros: - Non-stick - Easy clean - ""scratch resistant"". Supposedly you can use metal on this without worry, but I stick to wood or silicon. - Lightweight - Came in good packaging  Cons: - Small. I under estimated the size of this. If you want to manage the pan well for scrambled eggs, about 5-6 eggs is the most you can do. I will probably get the larger size."
"This is my go to pan for scrambling or frying eggs, which I try to do with as little butter as possible. With this pan cleanup is literally a squirt of soap and a swipe then rinse. Or, if I'm loading the dishwasher and this fits, I don't hesitate to clean it that way. I have another larger T-fal pan like this and they are staples in my kitchen. Another way I like to use them is to use plain dry heat for warming up. I HATE pastries heated in the microwave; ditto anything fried. I can put such things in this pan with no fat on low heat, cover the food with an upside down saucepan to create a little ""oven"". I can refresh a croissant this way that you'd never know was a couple days old! I picked up just one pancake at our breakfast buffet last week (all socially distant and masked!!!) . I'm not big on pancakes not made to order and eaten immediately but I decided I might have this one small one as a treat after my eggs and sausage. I had some fresh blueberries so I washed a few and threw them into this pan along with the pancake. Covered with another pot, heated a few minutes until the berries popped and the mediocre cold pancake was now a delectable dessert with butter and maple syrup. Blue berries burned a bit because of their natural sugar but the pan wiped clean very easily. I'll be doing this again!"
"Attached in my picture is the pan after a few months of daily use, sometimes multiple times a day. Do not use metal objects on these types of pans. You'll scratch and flake the surface, which ends up in your food. Which is obviously extremely unhealthy. Last one of these I had lasted me a few years before it started flaking. The non stick ability is great, just about everything will just rinse right off"
"I have been using it for a few months now and it is great. It heats evenly, cleans easily, and doesn't require much -- if any -- oil to remain non-stick. I have not had any problem with warping, but am careful to not use it at higher than medium heat, which is plenty for everything I have cooked. Unless I need a tiny pan to make a perfectly round egg or my giant deep skillet for mass quantities of food, this is the one I always grab."
"I got this because I have a tfal titanium set that's held up well for several years (I used the little skillet so much I decided to get this as a second so I'm not washing it as much) and I've gotten a few larger tfal titanium covered skillets (1x12"" &2x10""- these we're better than the pots/skillet set)... This little pan blows everything I already had out of the water!  The other pans do ok to good with sticky stuff like eggs... This little guy repells them like crazy. I made French toast this morning and I decided to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the eggy bread prior to putting it in the pan... I ruined my spatchula with the caramelized goodness, but the pan was great, quick wipe with a paper towel and it was ready for round 2!  DEFINITELY BUY THIS PAN - you Will NOT regret it!"
"While I've only had this for a few months, my parents have had their T-Fal for many years and theirs is still in almost perfect shape. My young pan is in the same condition as I got it the first day. I think most of the complaints come from having the stove heat WAY too high for a long time, which damages the nonstick surface. (My opinion.) I've cooked hamburgers in it over high heat, but don't let the pan overheat. And when I wash it, I'm careful to let the pan cool down and not automatically fill it with cold water, which I'd think could also damage the nonstick surface. This pan is a great value deal for the price! I'd definitely buy a T-Fal again!"
"I've been looking for a T-Fal pan that was absolutely flat on the inside. Put a couple of eggs in the pan so they don't fly to the sides and you have to rearrange the yokes back to the center of the pan. This pan is flat so there is no running to the outside. My 10"" T-Fal had a slight hump in the center. This 10.5"" pan is completely flat."
I bought the pan because of the heat indicator in center of pan to indicate when hot enough to add the food. I love the sturdiness that keeps pan from warping and even heating. It is also oven safe and light weight. Would buy again.
I actually got to try one like this out while on vacation. This pan worked so well that I ended up buying one when I returned home. It is a great price and it cooks so well and clean up is a snap. I think I am going to buy the larger one too just to have on hand. I love this cookware. I've purchased T-Fal before but the quality of this one seems better than the other T-Fals I have purchased in the past.
I've been searching for a pan like this for quite a while. My last pan was a Farberware non-stick which showed signs of use after just a week and within 2 had pieces of the non-stick coating scratching off from plastic utensils. So far after 3 weeks of use everyday there is no signs of use even with the occasional metal tong use.  My previous T-Fal lasted about a year but started showing significant wear which made me concerned about continuing to use it. This material seems much more robust and I'm hoping I get more than a year out of it. So far I'm very impressed!
"What I like best is that T-fal heat evenly and they are not heavy like some other brands. They are very easy to clean. Although they are dishwasher safe, I always hand wash. I also like the fact that in a pinch you can use metal utensils with them (just don't cut with a knife!). I had to buy another because I stupidly left one with drippings and bacon bits on a hot burner for about 1/2 hour, and it just doesn't cook the same anymore. But that's to be expected. In summary, I love T-fal!"
"I have two of these, an 8 inch and a 10 inch skillet. I have an electric stove and these pans work well with it. They heat evenly and food slides right off. I don't have to really scrub hard to get them clean, a quick wipe does half of the work. I use my T Fal pans more than my other pans because I get a good color on my fried foods due to the even heating. These are neither the cheapest pans nor the most expensive. This is one of those times when a pretty good product is also reasonably priced."
"Bought this pan to replace a pan I bought to replace my previous T-Fal pan I tacoed by accident with cold water.  It's got a super wide flat bottom that works great for conducting heat on a glasstop stove. It also has a much more durable feeling coating than the last T-Fal pan I had. So far I haven't scratched it, and I've had it for a while. I haven't had much stick to it, maybe to the sides, but a little bit of scrubbing and it comes off with a dishrag."
"This pan is fantastic. Cooks beautifully, cleans super easily, and is built to last. The thermo-spot is a nice touch. 'Didn't think I would use it, but I am using it every time. This is my second T-Fal, and I am now a serious fan. My other one was a more expensive model and I love it too. This one at this low price is surprisingly just as good as the more high end one. I am thinking of getting one to leave in my rental unit for guests - something I never wanted to do with a non-stick pan for fear of abuse and scratches; but this one is so durable and inexpensive, it might well be a risk to take to make my guests happy."
"I really like this pan - it's big, with high sides, great for cooking my scrambled eggs, spinach, and mushroom combo that lasts for several days and takes 8 oz. of mushrooms, 5 oz. of spinach, and 9-10 eggs. And it truly does not stick - at all! Cooks faster than my prior nonstick pans at lower temperature and cleans up quickly and easily. I intend to buy several more of these in smaller sizes."
"First non-stick frying pan that I have found to actually be non-stick. I use this every morning since it arrived. It really heats evenly -no hot spots! It has not scratched at all and is extremely easy to clean. Nothing has stuck to it and all you have to do it wipe it clean. I have always used a nonstick frying pan only until it scratched or stopped being nonstick, and then I would throw it away. I buy a lot of frying pans because they always scratch or start sticking after a few uses. I think this one is a keeper!"
"The pan is truly the only nonstick one that is actually nonstick. I've tried a TON of others. They all were not nonstick (Copper coated, speckled, glass, aluminum, and other black coatings that peeled). This one is the best so far. Eggs truly do slide off. PS please note this is in transit I didn't get it yet; I'm going off the first one we bought same brand etc."
""
These pans hold up to a lot of abuse and are worth the investment. Far superior to the faux perfect pans advertised on TV. I don't expect non-stick pans to last forever -- the T-Fal Titanium has been the longest lasting of all I've ever purchased.
This pan arrived as described. I noticed right away the pan itself is alot thicker than the T-fal of my younger years. The little dots did change colors as the pan heated up. The grilled cheese came out beautiful with less than a teaspoon of butter each. I'm still not gonna use a metal utensil even though the package says you can now. My previous T-fal lasted 20 years! I'll update this review if my feelings change.
"Awesome pan! Very light and easy to handle/clean. Extremely nonstick and gets hot quickly/evenly. It's much cheaper than other nonstick pans and given the lifespan of nonsticks in general, very easy to rebuy once no longer nonstick. I buy one for every family member once they need a new nonstick."
I received a 10 inch copper wear brand pan a couple of years ago and after the first 2 uses food started sticking and it was very hard to clean. I have a T-fal 12 inch saucepan that I love so bought this pan to replace the copper wear. Love it! So easy to clean and food doesn't stick when cooking!
"We had some nonstick pans and then moved to a new home that had a gas stove (electric previously). I’m not sure what happened, but the old pans became impossible to cook and clean so I purchased these and they’ve been incredible! Nothing sticks, veggies basically sautée themselves (no water needed) and they clean up so easily! Ended up buying the rest of the set!"
"I have another TFal Titanium pan - a larger one and am very happy with it. I ordered this one, a smaller one. MY only comment is with regard to the Amazon description - it wasn't clear but I thought since it said ""Dishwasher safe; oven safe to 350 DegreeF; Lifetime Limited warranty; vented glass lids; even heat base."", that it came with a vented glass lid but there is no lid - only the pan."
"Easy to clean, no sticking when browning potstickers. I have 2-8"" and 1-6"". Don't overheat. Say up to 70% or at least just long enough for the oil or butter to get hot, then turn down to medium and lower. You can still cook for maillard reaction but use lower heat and allow for longer. Also works with my portable Advantco induction stovetop hot plate. Clean lightly with nylon scrubber or with sponge. Don't advise using hard plastic spatulas. Best with wide silicon type, especially with easy over or omlets."
"We've been using this pan for a few months now and it's incredible. So far it's the most durable pan we've owned. It's super heavy which is really nice, and the heat distribution is VERY even. Still easy to clean even though we always forget to soak it, haha. We don't have one of those plastic nonstick scrubber sponges, just a regular dishcloth with no scrubby part, and it cleans just fine."
"A great little frying pan. Good non-stick surface. Not as thick as other similar T-Fal pans I have, but light weight and easy to clean. Great for omelets. Doesn't come with a lid, but my lids from similar size pans work just fine. Great value."
I love this skillet. It's 12 inches and the sides are more flat than rounded so give move cooking area than some skillets. I make 2 packages of bacon every Saturday morning and this is the skillet I use.
Bought as a replacement for one I had for many years.  I love the non-stick pan and its a perfect size to fry two eggs or make one hamburger patty. I love I can throw it in the dishwasher
"I love this pan for smaller items. The material is nice and the sides are pretty straight, which is wonderful for cooking. It keeps things from sliding out when stirring. Handy size to have on hand!"
"I bought gotham steel non stick pan, blue diamond non stick pan. I couldn't even make scrambled eggs on them even after applying cooking spray! Had to return them. I have been using this pan for more than a month and eggs never suck on the pan. Handles is great to compared to the others. Overall great cooking non stick pan!"
The T-fal non-stick fry pan is a terrific addition to our kitchen. Non-stick pans are so difficult to maintain for any length of time! We have owned the small size in this same pan for 5 years and it does not have a scratch! Terrific value too!! Highly recommend this pan!!
"Great skillet! Cleans easily, as expected with t-fal. The weight is great - heavy but not too heavy. I bought the 12 inch with lid and front handle not long ago. I love it but it is very heavy. This one is perfect for everyday use. Excellent value!"
"I have been using T-Fal products for years. This pan heats quicker and distributes the heat pretty evenly. The clean up of the pan( no matter what mess you make in i )is pretty easy. I don't put them in the dishwasher and they last for years. Also, you do not have to wait until they are cool to wash them."
"I have had several with this finish. I have had several other brands, copper, ceramic, etc.. NONE are indestructible. High heat will destroy the glaze on all of them. Do not preheat on high and go to facebook. Degradation starts and continues to worsen. I also suspect that hot acid is detrimental. Cooking with oil and lemon juice for my chicken seems to eventually cause a problem. I will continue to buy t-fal titanium."
"Delivery was prompt and packaged well. I love these pans. This is the 2nd one I have purchased. The first one was larger - and so wonderful - that I decided to get the smaller pan. These pans are true to their claim ""titanium"". I highly recommend them."
"This wasn't my first choice as I looked for a new non stick pan, but the one I wanted wasn't the right size for my needs. I'm so happy I purchased this one! Omelettes come out perfectly and it cleans up like a dream. Try it - you won't be disappointed."
"I use my Tfal skillet at least once a day, every day. They last about 18 months and that definitely meets my expectations of a nonstick skillet. This one was a small quality upgrade from my usual and I’m very happy with it and look forward to many months of daily use."
"I cook eggs 365 days a year and finally found a pan in which the eggs won't brown so easy on the gas stove, they don't stick, and it rinses clean with water and a finger and no scraping. Very happy with this pan."
Happy with these pans. We use them every day. They last approximately 10 months - one year with daily use and that’s fine with me for the price I paid.
I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. It was on her wish list and she has other Rachael Ray pots and pans. It's so nice I'm thinking of find one for myself. Great construction and quality. Nonstick is great too.
Great product. I love this brand. No need to spray or use butter for eggs and pancakes. They slide right out. And cooked scrambled egg rinsed right out of the pan easily.
Well made and balanced (the last small teflon frying pan I bought on Amazon would tip over when there was nothing in it!). Thick coating that seems to be holding up well and is easy to clean.
"We use this pan every day. Most days, it just needs a quick wipe while it's still a little warm. We've had it for about a year and it still looks brand new. Except the bottom, but that's not the pan's fault! Some people don't make sure the glass top stove is clean before they use it..."
"This pan is great for scrambled eggs, cooking meats or golden brown fluffy pancakes. It is so easy to clean and not too heavy for weak wrists. I would purchase this pan again!"
"The nonstick coating seems to be wearing off fairly quickly, but other than that I’ve been happy with this pan."
"If you need a small, durable 8"" fry pan that can be cleaned in the dishwasher very easily, this one is it. It was exactly what I wanted, so I also bought a larger version of the same pan. Have not tried metal utensils yet . . . the labels indicate they can be used with these pans. Recommended."
"I wanted something I can use to just fry one egg, or a couple of sausages. This is a great pan for those uses. I like T-Fal pans because the non-stick surface takes a long time to wear out. I have a griddle that I've been using for over 20 years and things still don't stick to it."
"Although I have All Clad pans that cost a fortune, this pan does such a good job cooking and is so easy to clean I usually reach for it first. I always use a very small amount of olive oil which seems to help its non-stick characteristics. This is a tremendous value for its price. Highly Recommended."
Even heat on the whole surface. Nothing sticks. Good price.
"This pan is better than expected. We bought a Tfal set without a smaller pan. This was inexpensive and the same size as one of the pots so we could also use our existing lid. The non-stick coating is nice and thick. Seems better than our other set. If you need a skillet this size, look no further."
"This is the third T fal pan I have purchased. It has been a great addition to my other cookware. It is just the right size for many smaller meals. Cleanup is a breeze, and is very durable. The nonstick surface allows you to use less oil for cooking. If your looking for a smaller frypan this one is a great choice."
"This pan is a dream to clean and use. You don't need oil unless you want it. I didn't rate durability because I haven't been using it long enough, but I expect it to last a long time. I will not put it in the dishwasher, though, and will never use metal utensils on it."
"Buying this pan made me mad that I put up with a crappy non-stick pan for so long. It works exactly how you imagine a great non-stick pan should. It is very easy to clean and things don't stick to it. It's also cheap enough that when it eventually wears out, I will happily buy another one of the same kind and not think twice about it."
Lovely non-stick surface making cooking and cleaning easy. Heat distribution seems to be perfect.
"Love the light weight and feel of the pan. It cooks evenly, like a heavier pan would do You can fry without oil though I always add some for flavor. It is so easy to clean. My first T-fal was an 8"" pan which led me to ultimately buy the 12"" pan."
"I've used T-fal fry pans for many years, as did my mother. Since I last bought one, T-fal has upped their game and the 10"" titanium fry pan I recently bought is the best yet! It cooks evenly, perfectly, and cleaning is a snap! Highly recommend these 10"" and 12"" pans as well as the saucepans in any size."
"Always use T fall fry pans, they last for years. They are also the most ""stick resistant pans I have used. I live alone and the 8 inch pan is just right for most of my cooking needs. Very reasonable price too!"
My wife loves this cooking line. They cook evenly and we have never had anything stick to the pan. A delight to clean
"these have been recommended by Cook's Illustrated, my trusted cooking and recipe source. Seems durable, cooks well."
"i had a small 8"" all-clad stainless steel that i bought on sale years ago, but after having a horrendous first experience using it, i swore off of stainless steel and reverted back to my nonstick pans. after finally learning how to CORRECTLY use that type of cookware, gave it another shot and became a believer.  not wanting to spend an exorbitant amount of $ for a bigger pan, i found this set here for around $12 (!!!!). my guess it was an amazon error on pricing, but a 4-piece set for the price of some chinese take-out? WHY NOT?  i'm not a pro chef, but i do like to cook. the added benefit of not risking any chemicals leaching into my family's food if the temp's too high is great. they seem to perform just as well as the all-clad, and the full set was cheaper than half the price of its sale price, too. my only complaint is that i always feel compelled to keep the outsides shiny and new-looking.  otherwise, i'm very satisfied at how well they perform. curious if jeff B uses the same kind of cookware, or if he opts for all-clad and/or similar since their cost isn't an issue for him..."
"Unbelievable nonstick performance at this price, egg in 1st pic was cooked without oil(I ate most of them), and 2nd pic is how it cleans after a hot wash, very impressed. Pros: Good heat transmission Great non-stick  Cons: Handles can get HOT, but TBH it's just above lukewarm than anything an cast iron would get. If your a female it should be fine since female tend to be less sensitive to hot temperature. But if you cant stand a bit of heat then don't get it , you have to be able to weild a heavy object with a bit of heat to take advantage of these pan cuz they can be HOT if you got even one inch closer to the conjunction. Basically, you have to be able to weild stainless pans like picture 3&4  if you have great upper body muscles get it, if your dexterity is high get it, it is NOT a great introductory frypan, it sutis ppl with some kind of kitchen experience and are currently lacking decent cookware for whatever reason"
Perfect excellent super helpful customer service. Pan smelled of metal to me unlike other pans of stainless steel I have used. Stomach upset after but I ate nasty somewhat nasty smelling newly bought mushrooms with a ton of organic vegan butter. Lid was odd and different than described and pictured. I don't recommend the lid. Nice 👍 in every other way. Bought on sale at $15. Who can beat this price... Really nice of them. Recommend the seller.
"I needed a new large stainless steel pan so while searching, I found many but, pricy. Then I found this set of pans by AmazonBasics. The quality of these pans is EXCELLENT!!! The base of these pans is very thick and the heat spreads through very well. They are heavy and that is very good. The lid fits all 3 pans perfectly so you can cover and let simmer without worries. The price was a steal!!! 3 pans with a lid for less than the price on one large pan. Buy these pans!!!"
"First of all, I’m new to stainless steel pans. I watched tons of videos of how to use it correctly. I got my package the other day and was super excited about it. First try, failed.. second…much better!! So the haters, watch some videos! At least know how to use it before you leave bad reviews…."
"The pans are so beautiful and well priced. I haven't used any of them yet, but from the looks of it, I know they are just what I need. The set allows me to use the right size for what I plan to cook. Thank you so much! I plan to buy another one for a gift."
Picture on Amazon page clearly shows rivets. Pic I added clearly shows no rivets.  I prefer rivets for durability but hard to complain at this price.
I was looking for an 8” skillet and came across this duo. I love it!!! The size and the other larger pan comes with a lid! It’s nicely designed. If you’re on a budget. U will feel like u hit the jackpot with these pans! Happy cooking.
Good pricing too
These pans are the same quality as my other mire expensive fry pans!
I’m always shocked at how easily these clean up. I’ve switched from nonstick to stainless steel and these pans have made the transition easy. They cook up everything nicely and I love that they are dishwasher safe!
Would definitely purchase again!
"Pans seem nice. Heavy, seem well made. Haven't used them yet, will update after first and multiple uses. The lid however is bunk. It doesn't fit the smaller two pans properly and doesnt appear that it will last the length of the pans life. Individual lids for each would have been better. So if you're needing lids that fit each, steer past these. Oh, and wasnt cool to see the item $4 cheaper the day the arrived in the mail. Another drawback, I'm having trouble finding pots to match these. ***update*** the handle is also absolute garbage. It should have a solid handle for the way it's formed. Instead it's hollow and closer to the pan it's thin metal exactly where it seems formed for your hand. Someone's going to get cut from it, soft hands while washing the pan. It doesnt feel good. Fix the lids and the handle and it'll be a decent pan."
NOT BAD. GLAD I ORDERED IT...
Nice pans for the money
"Good Quality,"
"Very solid pan set for induction cooking. Most ""induction compatible"" nonstick pans do not perform well on induction ranges. They heat up very slowly and they warp. The heavy steel base in these pans are solid, thicker than those tri-ply stainless steel pans. These pans won't warp. I'll update as to how the nonstick ceramic coating perform in time. But these set of 3 pans plus a lid is so dirt cheap! It's a bargain even if the ceramic coating only last 3 month. Only downside is they don't make a 12 or 13 inches size for the same."
"What I like is that there are no rivets on the inside part of the skillets, they are ceramic coated in a nice dark blue and on the outside they are a shiny stainless. They have a nice weight to them and so far no warping. I don’t see how they could with the heavy multilayer bottoms they have. I have one burner that is hotter than the sun so that was my big concern.  I’m no culinary expert on cookware. I picked these up for general use and the unfortunate occasional accidental misuse (the accidental burned potatoes or something). So far they seem to be pretty good for the everyday cooking. Especially for someone who has had thinner aluminum nonstick for the last 10 years."
"These pans were much nicer than I thought they would be for the price and being Amazon basics. Good solid bottoms that work well on my induction stove. I have an expensive brand that won't even work on my big burner. The interior is a very good nonstick. My only concern is that the handle is not riveted on. It seems to be tack welded. This may affect its longevity. If taken care of, I think it can last a long time. As cheap as it was, if it lasts a couple of years, it will be a great bargain. So far I like it very much and recommend them."
"These pans are substantial - quite hefty/sturdy, which was surprising. I don't have an induction cooktop, I have a glasstop electric and they work great. Awesome non-stick surface, easy to clean. I can't believe the quality for the super low price I paid! The lid handle gets extremely hot, which seems like a serious design flaw. I imagine if you use these on a gas stove, the pan handles would also get extremely hot - so keep that in mind. Beyond that, these are fantastic!"
"For how much these pans costs and how well they work I plan on buying these for every wedding and Christmas present I need. They cook very evenly and are easy to clean. The universal lid is awesome! These are some of the best pans I own, I actually bought a second set I liked them so much!"
Hay un error en la descripcipn y las fotos de los artículos. Se compraron 3 sartenes y solo envian 2 sartenes. Enviaron un reemplazo y presenta el mismo inconveniente.
"Owned this frypan set for less a month. Everything is great, especially for the price - 2 Stainless Steel Ceramic Coated Non-Stick Frypans with one cover for only $13? How? The only one star taken was because the Stainless Steel handle can be really hot. If it is wood or something then it is perfect."
Heavy pans. Even cooking. Non stick. Would buy again
"Not heavy, best nonstick surface & easy to clean!"
love these pans!
thanks 😊
"Thought this was a great deal! Turns out, they’ll stay looking pretty decent, but everything started sticking within a month! I can put butter, oil, spray on it, it still sticks! Very disappointed!!"
"Pienso que un excelente juego de sartenes, son pesados y parecen de buena calidad y a un excelente precio"
This cooking will stick to the pan and it is not easy to clean
"The lid is for...not while cooking. Its a decoration. Possibly for use as a cover for cooling. The skillets take forever to heat up. They don't conduct heat anything. There will be cold spots within the skillet. You must use largest range available on high heat. So heavy, for what? To masquerade as quality. There's nothing positive about these skillets. But you obviously have time and money to waste. Sadly honesty and integrity are free. Yet, no one who rated these positive cared to easily do so."
"These pans feel great out of the box, and the multi sized pan cover is really smart...but that's where it ends-Have tried using spray no-stick, butter, margarine, and vegetable oil...all to no avail....this is the equivalent of cooking on non-cured cast iron- Would give it a ""0"" star if available- even at a great price, these aren't worth the cost of shipping."
Surprised how sturdy & easy to clean for the price
"price is good, made of heavyweight material, but sometimes gets stick"
This is a horrible set everything sticks… please save your money
Burnt the pan first time using and can't scrub it clean. Cheap! Food stuck even with oil.
"I’m afraid to use because of the warning about memory loss! If I had known there was this issue, I would have never ordered them."
Cheap handles stupid cover
"Since I just got them and have yet to use them, lets just stick with what they look like so far on the 3 piece set the lid fits nice and snug both pans are VERY heavy and seem very well made both have an even finish to pan coating pan bottoms are nice and flat for my electric cook top will add more if they have issues over time"
These are the best nonstick pans I have ever bought and I bought a lot of them nice size even Heating two pans for the price of one you can't beat that if you're looking for non-stick these are the pants to buy
"To be honest, I bought these because they were thrift store cheap, and I needed some induction compatible cookware in a hurry. 3 pans for $17.00? Figured they might last long enough to find better. That being said, I'm quite impressed! Seemingly very well made, nice heavy bases. Work great on my gas range and induction burner. I'm a bit dubious about the ""ceramic"" non stick, but again, $17.00 for 3. And the complaints about the "" universal"" lid? Well, maybe. It's not the greatest thing ever, but it's not that bad either if you want to save space. The only weird part is that it kinda dips down into the bigger pans instead of rising up from them. I'll throw in the ""3 pans for $17.00"" bit again. The plain stainless are an even better deal if you don't care about the non stick bit. I think I might have to get a set of those too!"
"I needed steel pans for my induction cook-top which I use a lot. These were very cheap on sale so I ordered them and I liked the inclusion of a cover to prevent splattering. They are well made and stainless steel is stainless steel so no problem there. The criticisms I see relate to sticking, which will be the case with any steel (or cast iron) fry pan so you cannot fault the pan itself for sticking food. The pans are solid and heavy (good); I got my money's worth and cannot see spending the prices I see for other stainless steel pans. Highly recommended even if a few dollars more when not on sale.  Important tips: Steel pan users complain about sticking. Trick 1 is to preheat pan before adding oil. Trick 2 (a super trick!) is use a piece of parchment paper in the pan under the food. You can make great burgers this way; keep the heat a little lower then normal and turn the burger a few times. The burgers will turn out perfect and juicy and the pan will not need any cleaning!"
"Not a $100 frypan but for the money, so far, just great. I have a number of much more expensive cookware items and we will see how this is doing six months from now. But for what I paid, it's hard to beat. A bargain. Even if the nonstick dies in two years, which often happens, it's still a bargain."
Great price great product.
"As someone who has bought, used and discarded their fair share of pans throughout the past 5 yrs, I can honestly say these are the best pans I've owned EVER! I was looking for andonized pans over a year ago - told my husband what I wanted but he stayed with family who owned ceramic pans so that's what I got for Christmas last year. I detested those things! Everything stuck to them, they were impossible to clean and within a few months, there were marks on them that I couldn't clean. The year before, I had fallen for the commercials on those copper pans. Out of all I bought, I loved the deep, square one and that was it! I sooo hated the small one that my husband made eggs in - both of these 2 I mention? Eggs would stick to them so bad, I would have to soak them for hours. And the rivets? OHHH the rivets! I had food in those rivets like crazy. My mom did listen to me and for Christmas bought me a set of Andonized pans, just from another company. They were great BUT they didn't have coated rivets. So when I had enough of all this, I stumbled across these and gave them a shot. Oh how I wish these had been bought years ago. They are a cinch to clean - no matter what it is. From eggs to steak to burned food lol Doesn't matter - I have not have 1 single thing that I could not simply wipe off and clean with no problem! The rivets? I'm in LOVE with these rivets! They're coated so there is no food sticking to them!!! Things cook evenly - I've had no problems with uneven cooking. So I hand wash them. Big deal. I'd do this for the rest of my days to keep these pans, believe me! Buy these, you won't regret it!"
"I have had many nonstick pans over the many years and have never liked them. I have always been a stainless steel girl but I am now a convert!  I was kind of forced into buying a nonstick pan and that's how this all started. I bought some frozen Tai Pei potstickers (they're really good for a frozen product!) and tried cooking them for the first time in one of my regular pans but sadly, while they tasted good, they lived up to their name and stuck to the pan. Liking them as I did, I decided to buy a nonstick pan and purchased one of these T-Fal hard anodized pans and absolutely loved it! That led me to buying this two-pan set so now I have 3 of them. Now I want saucepans too. Too bad I didn't just buy the whole cook set but I never dreamed I would like these so much.  I've had nonstick pans in the past where things still stuck to them and they just weren't as hearty and well built as these pans. I've cooked several different things in them now with great success that would have been a problem in my other pans, including the potstickers which no longer stick. The clean up is a snap and they nest well with themselves and my other stainless pans. The handles are also very comfortable and easy to use. I have complete control when picking up even a heavily filled pan. I've had high end pans with handles that were absolutely horrible in terms of control. There's no need for an oven mitt or anything, they remain cool.  Whether you love nonstick pans or are like I was, a real hater of them, give these a try! They are fabulous!"
"Scammed by copper pan commercials, we wasted our money. We have also tried several other pans over the years that just always sucked.  We are vegan so we eat a lot of tofu, which has ALWAYS stuck in our previous pans. Not these! Even pancakes just slide right off. So much stress has been avoided in my kitchen since this purchase. :P"
"I waited a year to review these pans because a lot of time, pans ""revolutionary"" coatings easily chip and performance fades as they are used. The Good: After a year, the non-stick coatings are over 99% like new except where obvious abuse by silverware or other metal contact has scratched. That said, it takes a lot to damage the coating. Non-stick - NOTHING is 100% non-stick. That said, with correct temp and a little lubrication from your favorite oil, you can consistently cook eggs without a spatula. I can heat up sticky leftovers and remove the majority of the residue with a simple light soapy brushing in the sink. The Bad: The heat identifier isn't that visible. Oveall - these pans have met and exceeded my expectations and we use them daily because of their ease to use and clean. They are thick so they will not warp with constant use. It takes a lot to get them hot enough to burn your food. I have a12 yo child at home who is experimenting with cooking. She has not destroyed them yet."

"I have a nice set of cookware of all sorts. I wanted some nonstick skillets for things like eggs, sticky sauces etc. I had seen T-fal at places like Walmart. Weii.......these are not those type pans at all. These hard anodized skillets are a different thing entirely. They are a pro-grade item without the high price. They are flat, they are sturdy, they look nice. Cleaning is a breeze. I have used them now for months, they are still as good as the day I bought them. I do take care of them correctly, in return they do the job for me every time."
"Bought these because I was concerned about the surfaces degrading on our older non-stick pans. I had no idea how well these would cook! Love the even heat distribution and the indicator when the cookware is fully heated! This cookware just fries things so well! They make me look like a better cook than I am! Frankly, we are enjoying dishes I didn't bother to cook regularly before because they always seemed to stick. Will see how well these wear over time, and I do plan to put them in the dishwasher which might affect their longevity, but at present I'm truly excited to cook with these. The small skillet is perfect for a number of tasks, such as eggs, as the sides are fairly deep."
"The same 10"" pan I bought in the past was by far my favorite non stick hands down! Has a great side edge that makes flipping food super easy. Surface has held up really well even though I have to use a small amount of oil after awhile. However, even though these pans have that edge, the bottoms are not even remotely flat. The 8"" is high in the middle and the 10"" is warped the the side (tested with water before putting on stove) . My previous 10"" is totally flat. Only difference is the rivets were not coated by non stick material on older one. Also, just to test the non stick, I washed the 8"" and fried an egg with no oil for the first cook. Usually I can get at least a few months of complete non stickability. This time both eggs bonded to the bottom and had to cleaned off. Not good for the trial run... I think they are going back and maybe I can find something else with that edge I like. I tried the Pro series in a 12"" but had the same problem with the center being higher than the sides making liquids flow to the outer rim. If I have to use oil, may try to find something ceramic or stainless. I have a green pan that works great with a minute amount of oil but the sides are much lower so harder to do the quick flipping motion that works so well with fast cooking."
"These are the pans you want. Stop shopping and buy them. Flawless. Perfect size for my Kenmore stove, they cover the burners precisely, no extraneous heat escaping. Perfect, frankly. I use them ALL the time. Just set that stove to medium and don't worry about a thing. Easy to use, easy to clean. Steep sides also makes stirring a bit easier, you'd have to TRY to spill the food you're cooking. They feel and look sturdy as iron. The heat does seem to distribute nicely across the pan surface. What else is there to say? Can't be beat, IMO. (If you've had lower grade T-Fal stuff in the past, don't judge these based on those.)"
"I bought these same pans a year and a half ago for my kitchen and I use them almost every day. I bought these for a friend, and I hope he finds them a great addition to his kitchen, as well. They are so easy to clean and the heat distribution makes cooking a lot better! I find the smaller skillet very helpful in cooking for one. I wish they came with lids"
"Before cooking with the pans, we seasoned them with Canola Oil. Yes, you CAN season titanium pans and many websites recommend doing so. After that, we added 6 fresh egg and began stirring with a plastic spatula. A very minimal amount of the eggs stuck to the sides of the pan where it was somewhat difficult to scrape with the spatula. Once cooked, almost all of the eggs easily slid out of the pan onto our plates. The small amount of eggs remaining in the pan were able to be totally removed with very light scrubbing using a non-scratch cleaning sponge with plastic mesh. Pan looks as good as new and ready to cook our next meal."
"I just got a new electric smooth top range so I wanted some new, unwarped skillets to use on it. America's Test Kitchen tested a similar T-fal pan and said it was great so I bought these. They weren't the exact same pan that ATK reviewed but were a little heavier and cheaper, too.  Anyway, I LOVE them! I am careful with my nonstick pans. I hand wash them, avoid overheating them, and don't use metal utensils on them. This pan has been great. T-fal says it's okay to use metal utensils on them but I don't. My pan has been used almost daily since I bought it and it still releases eggs just fine and it is so easy to clean up. It's heavy, no doubt, but heats up extremely evenly for fantastic cooking.  I use the larger pan much more often than the smaller pan. If you just want to buy one I would recommend you get the larger one.  I liked them so much I bought a set for my son, too, and he loves them just as much as I do."
I debated between several different pans for a while and finally settled on these due to all the positive reviews. I'm so glad I did. These pans clean so easily and seem to heat much better than other pans that I've had. I only wash by hand and I do not use metal utensils but I treat all of my cookware this way so I can't say if they scratch easily but i would definitely buy these again. Well worth every penny and they are actually much less expensive than a lot of the pans that I checked.
"Bought these based on reviews and glad we did. They are somewhat lightweight but they work great, and are well made. The teflon ( which if I'm right ,is actually hard anodize on aluminum) is very much non stick. Food cooks good and the pans clean up easy. One review I read made a lot of sense. You can pay a lot for a pan, but the thickness of the coating is all pretty much the same, .002 of an inch. It can be less on a real cheap pan, but it can not be more. You will get the same lifetime out of the coating from an relatively inexpensive pan as you will from a real expensive pan. So if you can find something decently well made you might be saving a few bucks and get the same lifetime out of the product. These might not be the absolute best on the market, but we love them and are happy every time we use them. What more do you want from a pan."
"I had Calphalon which were much heavier with better heat distribution, and way more expensive. They started having issues with nonstick layer after about two years of use. Decided to try these ones and was pleasantly surprised. T-fal is good if you don't go with cheapest option they have."
"This is Amazing! Non-Stick that actually is non-stick.  The directions say to use a small amount of oil, and they mean like a teaspoon. Best used over medium heat. The pan has a red circle in the center when the spokes disappear, the pan is hot. Crack a couple of eggs in it and in a minute or so, give the pan a shake and they slide all over the pan. With a snap of the wrist and you can flip them over, then they slide out of the pan. Clean up with a paper towel and wash when cool.  I deliberately burned a slice of cheese in the pan, and it slipped out with a little push with a plastic spatula."
"For 50 years I searched for good quick-release cooking surface, reasonably scratch resistant, cool handles, even heat distribution at a reasonable price. After one year of regular use...this is still IT, as good as new. No more dating other cookware for me...those relationships always end rough too soon. The bonus is that this line is also beautiful and easy to keep clean, and my wife is not jealous."
"I used these pans at a friends house and had to have them. Got them, used them, and they are the best. Fried great and cleaned up great. I read a few of the one star ratings. LOL is all I can say about that .I wonder who these people are. I use different types of fry pans. Non stick teflon type, Stainless steel, and cast iron. They all have their place in the kitchen. When you need non stick fry pans, these worked great. I am very satisfies with my purchase. From my experience so far, they are non stick and slick as silk."
"I'm on my third set of these pans. The pans are great but they only last about a year or so if you use them daily. We try not to over heat them, but eventually the coating will wear out. I don't know of any other nonstick pan that lasts forever, so I assume all other coatings wear out too. I highly recommend them."
"I am happy with the purchase.. Do not use a cooking spray, not good for the coating. I use a drop or two or oil or butter depending on what I am cooking. Not really needed but I like to do it. Very easy to clean. They cook well using medium heat."
"This is the best set of inexpensive frying pans I've found. I like the riveted handles with silicone covers, and the hard-anodized finish is more durable than enameled or powder coated finishes. If you use a tiny dot of coconut oil or similar, nothing will stick to the T-Fal Titanium nonstick coating. You can just wipe the pan clean with a paper towel after it cools – no need to wash it. The T-Fal red center dot is handy for seeing when the pan is at the correct temperature for cooking. This is very well-made cookware at a bargain price."
"second set, first set coating finally wearing out. will buy again."
"Love these low-maintenance pans! We already had the 12"" and we liked it so much we just got the 10"" and 8"". They seem durable, the non-stick surface is great, and the best thing is you can throw them in the dishwasher. Because who likes hand washing pots and pans, amirite!? (Yes, I'm a guy.)"
These pans are great and should last as long as the old set. We bought the entire set 2 yrs. ago and couldn't be happier. The 8 and 10 inch are used almost daily and are in ruff shape. Thankfully these come separate so we didn't fork over another 200 bucks since these are most used pans in the bunch.
So far I have obly used them two times. Both time I have had NO sticking issues. I brought some nice looking aluminum cookware and those pans stick ALL DAY LONG
Got 8 and 10 inch fry pans to replace Calphalon which lasted a long time but have been losing their coating. New Calphalon are 2X more expensive than these T-Fal. They feel (weight & balance) and fry just fine and I have had great prior experience with t-Fal pots. So far - so good
"These are perfectly shaped, easy to handle and clean, and they cook perfectly. They say you can run them through the diswasher, but past experience with tFal suggests otherwise."
I use these pans every day. They work amazing and they hardly stick! Just a little oil or butter is needed.
"I had a T-fal pan a while ago and really like it, so when I saw those pans, decided to purchase them.....glad I did! I got rid of all other flying pans, all I need are those T-fal pans ;) Tjey don't stick and easy to clean. The small one is perfect for making an individual omlet!"
"I love my pans. They have the perfect size and depth. They are super easy to clean. I normally clean them with my hands and soap so I don't mess with the coating and it's super easy. I love that even the screws are coated because I bought a different brand and the screws were not coated, so the food sticks there."
"I have been cooking with a stainless steel pan for a year or so and everything stuck to it like glue without fail. Last night I got this pan and cooked some salmon. Normally when I cook salmon the skin sticks to the pan, ruining one of my favorite parts of the dish. Last night, I had no trouble whatsoever flipping my salmon and nothing stuck to the pan at all. It was like a dream!"
"These are tough, absolutely non-stock and the easiest pans in my kitchen to clean. I had a thermospot pan years ago and gave it away before the Teflon ever scratched off. I don't use these for much but a grilled cheese has never been crustier or easier to clean up and my delicate nuts get toasted without burning or sticking. I would prefer a heavier pan (just a preference) but my Mom who has Carpal Tunnel loves their lightweight. This particular anodized pan is a bit heavier than some of their others. If you cook for a big family, I would suggest buying the 13.5"" skillet with helper handle in addition to this set."
"I was disgusted with he price and short life span of the newest ceramic, non stick pans. I got about 6-10 months out of them. Even though I re-applied the oil and baked them per instructions after a couple months, they still had to be tossed out. So, I tried the T Fal brand and I am completely satisfied with it. Just FYI, discard pan if the finish starts coming off. I have had one T Fal non stick skillet that I've have for about 4 years or more and it's still fine but I don't put it in the dishwasher; wash it in hot soapy water instead. This will extend the life of the pans."
"These pans are well made, heavy, but not too heavy. The handles are cool and have a nice grip. Distributes heat evenly We are careful with ours, having purchased five of various sizes. Always allow to cool before cleaning them. And do not heat over medium heat. If you need high heat, grab your cast iron."
What I liked most about these frying pans was the heat distribution when you fry an egg or fry potatoes..you can actually see the heat cooking your food evenly all around the pan..I love that they are so easy to clean too!
"I love T-Fal but be careful that you aren't buying a ""cheaper"" T-Fal. I bought this set from Walmart and it was NOT of the same quality. I use these 2 pans every day and they never seem to wear. Love my purchase."
"I bought these pans two years ago. I use them every day and they still look and work like the day I bought them. If you know how to take care of pans properly, they will last a very long time. If I ever need pans again, I will certainly buy these again... no question!"
"These are the very best non-stick pans I have ever used. I rubbed them good with oil all over as soon as I got them and put on top of the stove eye for 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then rubbed them down with paper towels until they were smooth. I immediately scrambled six eggs, which turned out nice and fluffy and we had egg sandwiches with mayo. Ummmhmmmm delish. Not even a speck of egg stuck to the pan. You'll love these if you try them. They are deep on the sides also. Love love them."
"Easy to use, fast clean up."
I love the t fal skillets. They heat evenly and you don't need t have high heat. Cleans up really easy.
I love the way these pans cook. My food comes out delicious and evenly cooked and clean up is so easy. I cook with lower temperatures and get great results. My new favorites.
"Looks good, is easy to use and clean. A bit heavy (this is a good feature). Kind of expensive."
"I don't think, unless you are a moron, that you couldn't cook with ease and clean with ease. An ideal product that is even attractive on your stovetop :)"
"I LOVE these T-Fal TITANIUM pans. Look at my photos, see that bottom? These will not warp or buckle when they get hot & are being used. Wonderful non-stick, sturdy handle. These are far superior to any other T-Fal pans. It's in the construction, that bottom...I love that they are anodized. I got myself a set of the 8"" & 10"" and just sent a set to my mom. She was disgusted by the 2 cheap pans my sister had sent her for Christmas less than a year ago. She was thrilled to get these - she had used them when she was up visiting me over the summer & saw the great quality."
Always trusted TFal but on this model I found it to be even better than before; excellent quality and very good pan for any use; easy to clean for sure.
After two years of very heavy use it still looks good and is only now starting to stick to delicate things like over easy eggs. From now on I am only ordering T-fal pans.
"This pan is amazing! Nothing sticks at all! We don't even have to put oil or anything in the pan. I have never made scrambled eggs or pancakes without putting butter or oil in the pan before. But there is no need with this pan. And so therefore, cleaning is a breeze. It seems it will never wear out!"
They cook perfect!! So easy to clean Wish I had bought these years ago!!!
"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Super strong, very easy to cook with, and cleans without effort. The best pans I have ever owned."
"Why pay $100 or more for a frying pan. These work great and are super easy to clean. Eggs, steak, pork chops fish all cook fine."
"These pans aren't to heavy for me, and perform beautifully. Clean up is very easy. I have a cabinet full of pro cookware that is simply becoming to heavy for me to enjoy. These are my go-to pans now!"
"A year ago I bought the larger pan with the added handle. It was so good, with the pre-heat indicators, that I got the smaller versions. These are great and durable ."
"These sturdy pans are wonderful! The non-stick coating of my old pans was starting to peel and they needed to be replaced. So happy to have these titanium pans - they heat evenly, keep food from sticking,clean up easily and overall are a big improvement."
"Great pans, good value. I have some much more expensive stainless clad pans. these are much better."
I follow the directions on how to treat the pans before you use them and they work great there my go to pans for cooking great quality and prices.
"I originally purchased the same saute pan in a 5 quart size at Costco. I was very impressed with how easy it was to clean, and how evenly it cooked. Costco does not carry the smaller sizes, so naturally I turned to Amazon. I have owned this set of saute pans for 3 months, and at least one, if not both, are used daily. They still look brand new. It's important to note that the instructions say that you shouldn't use them on high heat for long periods of time, or plunge them into cold water while they are hot, as this will cause them to warp. The manufacturer also recommends that these not go in the dishwasher. That's not difficult, since clean up is a breeze."
Have bought several very expensive pans that say stick free and after one use they look 5 years old from stuff sticking these pans are by far the easiest to clean one rinse and they would be good to cook something else my wife tells me every time how awesome they are
I am so glad I bought these pans! I have been using these for a couple of month now and I haven’t had any issues. Food cooks quicker than most pans I have used in the past and it’s so easy to clean because I don’t need to use a lot of strength to scrub the pans. Highly recommend!
"Love these pans. Sturdy but not heavy, very easy to use and clean."
My favorite skillets! Use lower heat than you normally use. Don't use oven cleaner to remove stains on bottom! I ruined a set and had to reorder these. Lesson learned.
"I previously used stainless steel pans, and now that I use these they are a breeze to clean. I'm so happy with this purchase, and I have had no problems with them. Would recommend."
This is the second set I have purchased. I used the first pan for over a year and the only problem I ran into was a slight bowing of the bottom which made a seal to the glass cooktop less than efficient. The non stick surface is so good I purchased another for my sister! 'Nuf said?
Nothing sticks washes easily unlike other non atick i have used
I like the pans. The smaller one is my go-to egg pan. Both heat up quickly and the food cooks fine. That's all I can ask for.
"great pans, love to cook more than ever now. cleaning so so so easy."
"Let's be honest, these are non-stick pans, nothing really sticks to it, so wash it gently, don't scrub it too hard --- you don't need to scrub anyway. No extreme heat to fry things, no super hot directly thrown into ice water...just generally treat it well, it can last a looooooog time."
"Love these pans! They make cooking a pleasure! So nice to cook in, so easy to clean!"
"I have bought nearly every pot and pan T-Fal has, they are amazing. SO easy to clean, just rinse water and the mess is gone! How is that even possible? I've had mine for several years and they act brand new. I recommend getting the ones with the circles in the middle not the ones with the roughness inside."
"These are a game changer. Non-stick, absolutely. Really inexpensive. I tend to ding them up. But it’s ok. Get a new set every couple years."
"These are amazing. Non stick is an understatement. They are gliders, all food will come off no matter what. I tried straight egg whites and they wouldnt stick. They are super easy to use, make food easier to cook and taste, and get a semi wet paper towel and they are clean in 30 seconds."
"This is a great set of pots and pans as long as you take the time to take care of them.  1. Do Not wash them in the dishwasher. (Wash them by hand).  2. Do Not over heat them. (In other words when preheating, don't get distracted and let them just sit empty over high heat).  3. Do Not use metal or abrasive utensils. (Use Wood, Silicone, Plastic).  4. Do Not place HOT pots/pans/lids immediately in a sink with cold water. (let them naturally cool before washing).  If these common sense steps are followed, They will last you a lifetime! If any of these steps are too difficult for you, stick to cast iron or stainless steel pots and pans.  Any product is only as good as how the owner takes care of it!"
"I have owned a lot of cookware and did a lot of research before purchasing this product. If you do not care about using your pots and pans in the oven, this is the best non stick cookware you are going to find under the $700 price point and maybe even at all. This is NOT normal T-Fal cookware, the coating is COMPLETELY different and much more hard. I have owned a few T-Fal Ultimate products for over 7 years and have used metal on them many times, they still look and act brand new.  If you are looking for a premiere set of cookware that isn't for oven cooking, look no further."
"I fell for the good reviews. That was a mistake. My last set of T-Fal lasted 10 years, so I was hopeful. Shipped in a PLAIN BROWN box. I would expect manufacturer packaging, no? This made me doubt authenticity. THREE of the pans did NOT sit flat on my glass top stove straight out of the packaging. Light weight, for sure. Egg pan not in the set. T-Fal -fal quality has gone down the drain. I've already initiated the return. Went out this weekend and bought another set that is better quality and sits FLAT on my stovetop straight from the box. I should have listened to the one-star reviews from the get-go."
"I believe I submitted an initial review shortly after purchase but I'm back almost three years later to tell you these still cook like they're brand new and look like it! Heat distribution is excellent, they're solid quality, they cook food so fast, and they're so easy to clean. I have zero scratches, dents, or chips. No nonstick material is withering, flaking or anything. These are the real deal. Be really cautious about these negative reviews. An honest review holds more weight than one filled with negativity. I cannot believe the price of these versus what you get. These are a STEAL and I would buy a second set in a heartbeat."
"Great product overall. I am very happy with the quality and so far the non-stick feature is working phenomenally. I stuck to the anodized titanium as opposed to the copper like some people got and it works out well and haven't had some of the issues others have. I've always had bad experiences with copper so I just stay away from it. As a warning you MUST use these pots on a medium-high heat; my glass stove top goes up to 10 and I do not use it past 8. I made the mistake of using one of them on high heat and it did not end well, pics attached. It ended up causing some weird markings that I assume is where some of the non-stick layer was burned off. The pot is still non stick surprisingly but the markings remain. The only gripe for me is the strainer pot. Despite my best attempts it developed some water markings right after my 3 use. You will not regret getting these pots. I cook everyday and use almost all the pots minus the very small one I think you use for eggs or something. I kept my old pots, that I had for like 6 years, just in case these were a disaster. Glad to say I threw them away two weeks ago.  The last suggestions I would give, which should be no brainers are: 1. Use wooden spoons to cook and don't use abrasive sponges to clean the pots. 2. Do not use bleach or use it very sparingly. 3. Let the pots cool down for a few mins(approx 20) before you wash them after use, this prevents the warping that plagues some consumers. 4. You don't have to let them sit in water prior to cleaning, everything slides right off."
"These are a great pan out of the box, the problem is that they don't last. My set started to lose it's non-stick and when I sent it back to T-Fal under the the ""Lifetime Warranty"" they returned it untouched, and told me it was a cleaning problem. I then called them and explained that it was only one section on the edge that lost it's non stick, so I didn't believe it was a cleaning problem, they responded by suggesting I buy I new pan!!!! Total waste of money!"
"I am so angry, I could spit nickles. Fry pans are titanium and scratch resistant. None if the pots are! They are junk. Not even same product as the pans, not hard anodized and scratched with a tea spoon used to stir soup! Already discarded boxes so can't return. At 60 I deserve a decent set of pots and pans. @*&%^$@!!!  The bait and switch is really on TFals' part. Their own description does not differentiate the 2 totally different character features of this set. The pots don't even have the T hot spot and surrounding design. They are just solid black and scratch super easy. They sell these as metal utensil safe, they are not. Then in their warranty they say if you use metal utensils the warranty is void."
"I love this set. I searched high and low for an affordable yet tough set of pans that I could use metal utensils on. After weeks (literally) of research I narrowed it down to these and I haven't been disappointed. Now, the indicators IN the pan do somewhat disappear when the pan is ready but not completely which I believe was a complaint. This is minor and doesnt bother me. Other reviewers also complained about warping, chipping, etc. When you unpack these they come with CLEAR instructions on care for longevity so if you aren't nice to them then they wont last. The handles are covered in a soft grip material and stay cool to the touch, the lids have steam holes in them, and they heat very well. The coating on the inside allows to pretty much not even having to use oil and I DO NOT use cooking spray on them either. I saw complaints about the ""double boiler"" or steamer or whatever you wanna call it but it works perfectly every single time to steam vegetables. No complaints here!"
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.  I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.  I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..  Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.  It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???  So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.  UPDATE: As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set."
"Pros: Sturdy. Exceptionally comfortable handles. Not inclined to warp like all the other cheaper pans I've owned (at least, not yet). Even distribution of heat. If well maintained*, exceptionally easy to clean (* - Follow the directions regarding excessive heat. There's no need to ever go above 5 on a 10-step cooking surface)  Notes on the Non-stick surface:  With the regrettable exception of those trendy wrought-iron pans that require a full-time kitchen steward to keep them from rusting, these are the first pans I've yet owned that come with instructions for both seasoning and maintenance. That said, it's well worth the effort. The seasoning and maintenance efforts are miniscule in comparison to the aforementioned culinary primadonnas and the result is a non-stick surface as opposed to the antithesis of a non-stick surface.  Unlike those miracle copper pans in which you can fry an egg without any preparation or oily lubricant and watch the egg slide out onto your plate without the need of a spatula, these pans do requires some oil when frying eggs. However, with a conservative application of natural lubricant (my personal favorite is coconut oil), these pans are amazingly resistant to having food stick to them; both during cooking and clean-up. I've never had to scrub either pan. A simple wash cloth with a light amount of dish soap has them looking essentially new after 2 months of regular use.  Additional Note: Regarding those miracle copper pans, it has been my experience that the neat little trick with the egg works exactly like you see on the late-nite infomercials---once! ...and only once. After that first time, the non-stick aspect of those copper pans steadily decreases to the point that they are about as non-stick as the glass surface of my electric stove-top."
"I'd give these pans 4.7 stars. They are both scratch resistant and incredibly non-stick, do exactly as intended with minor improvements possible.  Let's start with the pros (my roommates have tried everything to destroy these pans): *Plan to leave food out in them for two days? - No problem, washes right off *Plan to stab them with forks while cooking? - No scratches? Whoa. *Plan to forget them in the oven? - They're oven proof, no melted mess today.  The cons: *The cooking indicator light does not work, at least on my electric stove-top. *The outer rim is slightly lower so oil collects there instead of being evenly spread.  All in all, if a bunch of college students can't destroy this pan I'd say it's a worthy & durable purchase. At this rate I plan to be using it a year from now no problem. From our test kitchen, hope you enjoy your new indestructible pans!"
"I was looking for a high-quality non-stick set that can last me a while as I had moved from NY to FL. We had the copper pan set that was gifted to me from my parents, but it wasn't very non-stick or high quality. Enter this hard-anodized t-fal set that was on deal. WOW, what a difference. I'm actually excited to cook food again with a good non-stick set. These pans have lasted through triumphs and fails for our recipe tests and come out just as non-stick as they were the day we bought them. We still use our plastic and bamboo utensils, as I want to preserve the non-stick coating as best as we can. My only issue was it came in a box that wasn't immediately marked as being T-Fal, but after investigating the ship from address I could verify it was authentic."
"Although they are well constructed, I have had the worst sticking problems with these T-Fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick of any fry pans I have ever used. Polish sausage juice burns to a thin carbon that is nearly impossible to get off. Chicken sticks so badly that it rips apart when you try to flip it. Eggs stick and leave a thin layer of burnt crust. These fry pans behave as if they are unoiled bare metal pan. Cleaning is extremely difficult. It takes me 10 minutes of scrubbing with a 3M pad, scraping with a plastic tool and scouring with Baking Soda to get them clean. T-Fal Customer support says the pans must be “seasoned” (lubricated) with hot oil every 10 washes in order for them to have any non-stick characteristics, same as an old fashion unoiled iron skillet, so why are they called non-stick? By the way, I did season them before the first use, and I have only used them 6-8 times. The 15 year old Teflon pans these replaced never required this level of maintenance or had such severe sticking problems. For me, these are a huge disappointment."
"Great Pans, Great Price. Arrived a few days earlier than delivery date. I read the reviews, & directions that come w/pans. Pretty sure they'll last a long time as I do not overheat pans while cooking. I was given a used one a few years back, & have passed it on to my daughter in law. Long life on these pans. Worth every Dollar!"
"Another reviewer mentioned the cookware came in a plain brown box. So when mine arrived in a plain brown box, I was skeptical. But the box also had an official T-Fal owners manual and the warranty. Although it's a little light for my preference, this is great cookware. For those with pans with scorched bottoms, the manual clearly says medium heat. The heat distribution is so good, medium heat is plenty. I really like the vented lids with handles that aren't too hot to pick up bare handed. Clean up is very easy. Also, I've used every pan in the set and all of the pans lay flat on my stove top. I'm older and learning from my past experience with nonstick cookware and these days my mantra is medium heat and save nonstick cooking spray for bakeware"
"I just bought another set of 10"" & 12"" for backups, to the set I just brought into service. They are a good value at; $20.00 to $25.00 a piece. The 12"" in the pictures saw every day use for two years. I have a full set of Calphalon pans, and after 6, or 7 years; the fry pans were done, but like all good cookware sets; the rest of the pots were like new. I use only silicone utensils. When I tried to get replacements; They were no longer in production, and I only found one opportunist selling a 12"" for over $100.00 on Ebay, so to prolong my set; I found ""TITANIUM""! The Calphalons are ""still kicking""! Going on 10 years, with new life, from T-Fal! I was hoping to get 3 years from T-Fal; But as you can see; The titanium is not embedded on the pan, with the non-stick, filling in the rest; they are actually a sort of metal paint job. Oh well! IMHO; If you pay more than $50 for a set of these, you'd do well to research a better pan. They are not worth more. They ""are"" a good pan, but they shouldn't be selling for $83.00 for an 8"" and 10"" set, from a seller on Walmart's site. Thanks for the ""fair"" $42.99 price Jeff!"
"I have been researching replacement cookware for a long time and always found myself unsure of what to buy. I am not a home chef or even someone who cooks a great deal, but I did want something that was non-stick and non-toxic. All the major brands were expensive and reviewers seemed to fall out of love with them after a while or at least find a few disappointments right off the bat. And then I found these (here the angels singing in the background)? All I can say is what a find! Now keep in mind, as I said, I do not cook a lot or even every day. But I have had these for several weeks and really do love them. I have used the small fry pan for eggs, the small pot for oatmeal, the middle pan for pancakes and the larger pot for pasta.  Pros: 1. Came beautifully and carefully packed. Two pans had small scratches on the lip of the pan (not a cooking surface) and one lid had a tiny ping in the lip where it closes on the pan. But non of this affects the cooking at all. 2. They a good looking. 3. They are very non stick. I make eggs almost every day with just a spray of EVOO and they are amazing. (I don’t use the kind that has propellant in it or any added ingredients. Just straight olive oil or avocado oil). 4. They heat up quickly (and do follow the directions…do not crank the heat up to high to heat them). These are for low, medium and med-high heat cooking. And you don’t need to use the high heat. Just start on medium and they heat quickly. 5. Clean up is a dream. I do not put these in the dishwasher. I hand wash and it is a breeze to do. I use a tiny bit of dish soap and a scrub daddy. Very easy. TIP: Don’t put the pan in the sink with water right after you turn off the heat. Allow the pan to cool on the stove before washing.  Cons: The only complaint I think someone might have is that they are very light weight. I love this feature as my other pans were really heavy and I hated that. But someone who has used heavier cookware may think these to be low quality or cheap or not durable. And who knows? If you are hard on the cookware, maybe these would not hold up. But for me, they are perfect.  I hope this helps. Good luck!"
"I have been using this set of pots and pans for over a year now and I am still very happy with them. There are so many choices out there that it was hard to make a decision when I was in the market for a new set. This set met my needs because of the wide variety of pieces included. It includes not only several sizes of frying pans, but also several sizes of sauce pans and a nice stock pot. The one thing I could sometimes use that it does not include is an extra stockpot. There are just times when two are needed for a large meal, but I don't think any of the sets I looked at contain two stockpots.  One feature that is really nice with this set is that they are very easy to clean. Nothing seems to stick to them. I have burnt rice and it peeled right off the bottom of the sauce pan. I have cooked caramel, forgotten the leftovers in the pot and come back the next day to a hard, sticky mess and it cleaned right off with just soap and warm water. This is huge!  Another positive is that they really do not seem to get scratched. I am very careful with the utensils I use, mostly using wooden spoons or silicon, but every once in a while, a kid comes along with a metal spoon and scrapes the bottom to get the food and my pots have no scratches or marks.  The handles stay cool while cooking in most cases. The lids are all clear so you can see what's cooking inside. They do have a little steam hole in each lid which is sometimes good and sometimes not so good, but we have managed quite fine. The lids have stay cool handles too.  I really like this set and would recommend it for family use. (This is my HONEST opinion. I was NOT paid nor compensated for this review in any way.)"
"I've waited 2 years to write my review. I must say that to this day my pans still look and work like new!! I am very impressed! I cannot think of a single problem that I've had.... I love the stove to oven versatility. They clean up easily, and considering I don't have a dishwasher, I'm glad that they do. Take care of your pots and pans, and they'll take care of you!"
"So far so good. This has been my favorite set from T-Fal so far. We had older sets that just needed to be replaced and this was definitely a good buy. The pans have a very slick coating that seems to hold up well and haven’t had any scratches. Mine tend to have bacon, beer, steaks and eggs on the regular, and whatever else I can cook up on a drunken late night before bed, and they haven’t failed me yet."
"I originally purchased the 12"" pan at the end of 2017 and it lasted until September of this year. The pan had a great coating and was very non-stick for about a year and a half. At that point, it started to stick just slightly. I noticed it with things like fried eggs where it became slightly more difficult to flip food without some sticking. One thing that did bother me with the pan was that it warped very early on. I left my electric stove on high heat when I was trying to get it warmed up quickly and forgot about it for a couple of minutes. When I came back the pan was no longer flat. In the description they state that the base is warp resistant, but only up to a point. So since i have a glass top stove it was annoying from that point on dealing with a curved bottom pan where food would always drift to one side of the pan.  Overall though it's a great pan, and it lasted for about as long as I thought it would. I ordered new ones since the coating started to deteriorate at the heat indicator spot in the middle of the pan and I didn't want the coating to be in my food. I've used the pan in the oven and it does just fine. It's a pretty sturdy pan with a thicker bottom than a cheap pan you'd find at the store. I have pictures of the new ones I got compared to the one that lasted just under 2 years.  To summarize:  > Pros - Great non-stick coating makes cooking easy - Good price for the quality of pan - Sturdy bottom holds heat well and distributes heat evenly. - Oven safe  > Cons - Pan became warped and didn't sit flat on my stovetop. - Coating wore out and started to flake at the heat indicator spot - Handle started to become loose with no way to tighten"

"Phenomenal professional-grade cookware that is so easy to clean! This set is excellent. I augmented it with the 5qt jumbo cooker for bigger dishes that need a higher side than the big frying pan. I’m an amateur chef and use this cookware every day. It’s the best cookware I’ve ever owned, even though I’ve had more expensive professional sets from Calphalon and Germany.  I use only silicone cooking implements to prevent scratching. Wash it by hand with Dawn, not in the dishwasher, and it won’t fail you. I have had zero problems with fit or finish. My set was flat on the bottom unlike those of some other reviewers. Like other cookware sets, it is raised slightly in the middle so just swish around the butter or oil if you are using any. They heat up fast and cool down fast. When you’re done, leave it on the stove to cool before putting water in it to clean.  This set stacks well and economically in my pullout shelves. Even the 5qt jumbo cooker fits between the big frying pan and the next piece. The rubber handles are excellent and stay cool to the touch. They also help keep the biggest glass lid from sliding around when I place it on top of the cookware for storage.  This cookware is an excellent deal!"
"I absolutely love this whole set! No issues. I thoroughly read all the material that came with the set in the box and it's all held true this far. I've had this set for a few months but didn't want to post until I got experience under my belt using the set.  I use the correct size pot or pan on the correct size burner, I don't ever use high heat on any of them (I don't exceed medium heat), no oil of any kind is necessary but I still use olive oil for health benefits, I only use silicone utensils with my T-Fal set so it never ever gets scratched, (I purchased a silicone carousel utensils set separately that matches T-Fal set), I always gently hand wash with gentle side of sponge (never hard side) and never put in dishwasher, and I let the pots and pans cool off when hot before immersing them into water in sink.  I highly recommend this set. All my lids work great, the handles on pots and pans don't get overheated, and food even tastes better because of the high quality of the pots and pans. Every meal I make seems to taste better in these.  I was really nervous about investing in this expensive set out of fear of being disappointed, but I've been nothing but happy with it. Respect the set and actually take the time to read the directions and you'll find joy in cooking with them. Purchase, read, and enjoy!!!"
"This set is fantastic. I have a hard time understanding any of the negative reviews. It’s just a great set. Easy cleanup, perfect cooking and just an attractive set to display. Read the directions, don’t use the scratchy side of the sponge, don’t put in the dishwasher because that wears them down slowly. After reading the directions I found that the red dot in the middle will go completely red when it’s at the optimal cooking temperature. Great technology. Just respect the pans, use the right utensils and clean them gently. I was using cast-iron but it’s just a lot of work. Convenience is king. Very, very happy with this set."
"I rated these 5-stars. My rating criteria was:  1. The product met or exceeded my price expectation. I thought the price was super competitive when I bought these in 2021.  2. The product met or exceeded my quality expecting. So far so good. They heat up nice and evenly. No hot and cold spots discovered so far. They are remarkably lightweight, which is nice. I feared the thin body might affect performance but it does not seem too. I have been using for three months now. MAYBE they aren't restaurant quality or something, but they are way better than my old set of the same make.  3. The product met or exceeded my performance expectations. Bottom line is after 3 months of daily use, J am the family cook, I really like these. They clean up great. Non-stick surface is all that. Just wipes clean. The steamer insert is super nice and not expected.  4. The delivery met or exceeded expecting. They arrived the next day I think. Stupid quick."
"I bought this set about a month before Prime days, and wish I'd waited since it went on sale for a substantially lower price. Bummer. That said, I really like the set. The ""griddle"" pan is great for frying bacon, and the little egg skillet is perfect for frying up a single egg. All the other pieces are very functional. The non-stick coating works exceptionally well on all the pieces. The ""heat circle"" which turns red when the skillet is properly heated up is a nice, unique feature. One little negative is the fact that there is no lid for the medium-sized frying pan. It's odd because there are two of the same size to fit other pans, so one might suspect they could have made one just slightly larger for the frying pan. All in all, a good, versatile set for everyday use. Recommended!"
"We recently replaced all of our old cookware with this T-Fal ultimate hard anodized Titanium set. It's fantastic! Cooks great, super easy to clean, handles stay cool. Because it's so easy to clean, I only hand wash as dishwasher detergents & rinse aids can affect even the best non-stick surfaces over time. I also don't use metal utensils even though it says you can. One great feature I haven't seen mentioned in the description is that the handle rivets are also non-stick coated. This was a welcome surprise when the set arrived. I did a lot of research before buying & had even purchased a different brand highly rated, very expensive set, but it arrived damaged, so back it went asap. The quality of this T-Fal set is just as good as the expensive set & much easier to use. Very happy with it."
"I have used this set for a couple of months now, and I have been very pleased with every aspect. I specifically chose this set because of the 3 sizes of saucepans in it. Heat distribution is great, non stick finish and exterior is like new. Yes, I put it all in the dishwasher. No, I don’t expect it to last forever. I passed along my older set of tfal to a friend and it’s still cooking fine, just looking a little aged (just like me lol). When it’s time to replace this set I will go with tfal again. You won’t get hurt at this price even if just a couple of years, but I got 7 out of the last set."
This is a nice large set of pots and pans. Excellent value for the price paid. Nice anodized exterior Only complaint is that the 10.5 inch frying pan doesn’t have a lid. I ordered a genetic lid from Amazon. I cook on an electric stove so the heat distribution is fairly even. I always use silicone or plastic utensils so scratching is not an issue. Nice non stick finish.
"Cookware sets vary quite a bit by the weight of the pieces, what pieces are included in the set, etc. I researched online for months before deciding on this particular set. I was so happy with the first set of this T-Fal cookware that I bought, that I bought a SECOND set just so I'd have it available a few years down the road when my first set starts to show wear. The pots and pans are fairly lightweight compared to some cookware types (important for people who are a little older and/or have arthritis) and are easy to clean, and this set contains all the pieces I would ever use. I didn't think I'd use the steamer insert, but I've actually used it multiple times and find it nice for steaming vegetables."
"Esta batería de ollas está recomendada al ciento por mi. Obtuve un juego anterior que aún con 9 anos y su cuidado Lucian como nuevos. Se me ocurrió la idea de que la marca famosa de stailess steel era mejor lo cambie. Y que decepción se quemaba o se pegaban las cosas. Pues dije porque? Quien me mandó? Y regrese a mi gran marca Tfall este equipo trae exacto lo que necesitas para tu cocina. Tamaños buenos de muy excelente material. Cocinas rápido, no quema nada y no pega nada. Es facil de limpia siempre y cuando uses esponjas y panos adecuados ( por favor no estregues con brillos, ni cosas afiladas) pues podrás danarlos y tendrías que eliminarlos porque si se le sale la capa peligras, podrías pasar tóxicos a tu cuerpo. Utiliza cucharones de goma o madera nada de metales. Esto lo rallaria. Tfall tiene unos muy buenos. Otra, son fáciles de limpiar, guardar y cuidar. Soy práctica y minimalista solo tengo este juego, me es suficiente excepto una gran olla sopera de Tfall sería un éxito para completar. Lo recomiendo a todos lo que deseen comenzar y durar con un buen equipo en tu cocina. Las tapas son en cristal para no destapar a cada momento, evita la perdida de vapor , contiene su valvulita de escape muy segura así es mejor para ver cómo va todo. Estoy segura que ahorras tiempo, dinero y energía con esta batería, Compra de oro para mí. Si deseas un buen ánimo y amor por cocinar este sería tu equipo. Y de precios excelente y ahorras mucho, evitas el tener que salir corriendo a buscar otra olla porque? Estás completa y te aseguro no te descepcinaras."
I am submitting this review after a month of use on a gas stove. This was a reasonable priced cookware set. It cooks evenly. The T-Fal Red Spot is a gimmick. The spot does not change in color to indicate pot/pan readiness. It is very easy to clean. No scrubbing necessary. Simply wash in soapy warm water and dry. Pot/pans are not too heavy or too light but have a nice weight to them. Ergonomical designed handles makes for easier maneuvering. The handles remain cool during cooking process which is plus. Lids are see through with steam release opening. This great because you don't have steam hitting in the face. The only thing that would make this the perfect set is if they had more of a stackable design and if the lids had built-in strainers. I would definitely refer this set to cooks who may not be able to afford higher end cookware.
"Going from six year old pans that stick to these are an obvious upgrade, but these pans are better than my old ones when they were new. Previous set was also T-Fal, but cheaper.  So far, I like everything in this set more than any other cookware set I’ve used. The heat distribution is great, everything sautés, boils or fries very nicely. I’ve even use shallow oil in the pans to fry up panko breaded chicken to a beautiful crisp.  Two things I like a lot more than cheaper cookware are that the handles are riveted and the handle material is much more heat resistant. I no longer have to get a flat head screwdriver or star shaped screwdriver to tighten the handle because it got loose. The handle has a rubbery material on it was well that grips nicely and does not hold heat. It’s very helpful when all the burners are being used.  Overall, for the price point, this is a nice set of cookware. My last set lasted for six years, hopefully I’ll get ten years out of this if I treat it well."
"My wife bought these based on the TFal name. And after a household of 7 wearing out department-store fry pans every other month or so. Well, we all love these pans! Heat distribution is awesome... and no doubt as long as no one uses metal utensils in the pan, the coating will last forever. We have had ours for over 8 months and they look as good as when she took them out of the box. So loved, that when a son moved into his very first home, she bought him a set as well. And that it is a 2-pack of different sizes is wonderful HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR DURABILITY, HEAT DISTRIBUTION, CLEAN UP and VALUE!"
"I’ve had this set for about 6 months now and they’re your average cooking pots and pans. They do their job well. I did have one problem with the small pan though. I cooked an egg without oil since they’re nonstick but the egg got stuck. It left a burn mark on the pan and even after washing it a few times, the burn mark was still there which made other eggs get stuck in the same spot. I don’t know if uneven heat distribution played a role but that was my experience with the small pan. The pan still does its job and the size is perfect for smaller portions of whatever you want to cook. I haven’t had any problems with the other pots or pans. No scratches yet on them either but that might be because I use silicone spoons and spatulas.  (The burn mark eventually came off after soaking in Dawn Platinum Powerwash)"
"I had bought a 2 piece set (8"" & 10"") several years ago, and I wanted another 10"" and a 12"" frying pan. I saw this set and thought I would check the reviews. I always check the reviews before I purchase a product. I was amazed at the negative reviews. I absolutely love these pans and am baffled why people have issues with these. The first set I bought is just as good as the day I bought them. I do use them daily and they are washed in the dishwasher. They heat evenly, clean easy and easy to use. Of course I DON'T use metal utensils in them and I honestly didn't know that they could be used in the oven. Good to know, though. I HIGHLY recommend these pans to anyone that is in need of frying pans."
"I bought these to replace my mom's entire set since they were getting pretty old and beat up. We've only been using them for less than a month but they've been absolutely wonderful so far. We're still getting used to the way they cook, the instructions say not to use them on high, so it's been a bit of a learning curve in trying to figure out how to change up the way we cook. Mom forgot the first time she used them and the food she was cooking cooked lightning fast and not in a good way. I think it has something to do with the material heating up quicker? So putting them too high makes it harder to judge and all. That was more our fault than the set's of course.  Overall I'd say they do a pretty dang good job, and so long as you don't put them on too high it's pretty easy to measure the cooking temperature without it going too crazy. Cleaning them has been a breeze. I was worried the first time I made something and saw it sticking to the side, but even after leaving them out for a night or a few hours after cooking everything came off super easily so I'm super grateful for that.  Since I've never bought anything cooking related before I was worried this product would be of low quality compared to other sets that cost 3 times as much but I'm glad to say their quality overall seems pretty good and they have been working very well for us so far! I got this set when it was $130ish, but even at its non-sale price, I'd say this is a very good budget set to go for. It's got a nice variety that should cover a good amount of stuff you'd wanna cook and the ease of cleaning makes it a breeze to just clean it and cook something else right away after it cools."
"After much deliberation, I bought this set as it contained all the sizes of pans I normally use. Also, I have hand and wrist issues and can't use really heavy pans, so I was looking for a set that had good conductivity but easy for me to use. I had a previous set of Tfal pans that lasted 15 years, so I was willing to give these a try. I'm so glad I did! They are great. They look good, have a decent weight to cook well and stay balanced on my ceramic stove. They clean up so easily with soap and water. I only use silicone utensils and I let pans cool down before putting in cold water. No warping, no sticking. Most foods just slide out easily, and those that are more stubborn release with slight scrubbing with sponge. I cook basically oil free, and nothing has been an issue so far. I am really happy with these pans and hope they last as long as my last set."
"I did a lot of research before buying this set as this would be my first set of ""adult"" pots and pans of which I've spent a load of cash on. I looked on stores, I looked online, read reviews, hemmed and hawwed for months before I settled.  These are amazing, and the price paid has been worth every penny. The hear distributes evenly, they clean quickly, they're truly non-stick, even the rivets on the inside where the handles connect.  The variety of sizes of each pot and pan is truly what is great about this set. The handles are cool to the touch, even the lids.  This set is what I was searching for, what I needed. You won't be disappointed, nor will you need another set or a single piece to find that missing size needed."
"Purchase this set in April 2021. LOVE it. So many choices of sizes, so many lids. I have found it to be well coated with durable Teflon. Very scratch resistant. I have not seen any scratches yet. I take care to not use sharp object to cut or stir. My previous set was a Rachael Ray set and it was a mess, no matter how careful I was it scratched. This T-Fal set looks nice , cooks nice and cleans up nice. I still apply a little cooking spay for common sense things like eggs, but I highly recommend all T-fal products. I have some 30 year old cookie sheets, and a roaster pan that is still use to this day."
"I love these pans! They are amazing. They cook food evenly and well. And they are SOOO easy to clean. You can cook something and let it sit for a little bit and it doesnt need soaking or scubbing to get the residue off. When i cook something inside it slides right out as if it was never in the pan in the first place!! Ive had these 2 months now and I love using them. If you dont want to wash by hand, putting them in the dishwasher works well. So easy to clean! And so far i havent had any food stick to them (i still use cooking spray for eggs and such. But with veggies or meats, it doesnt stick or leave layers of cooked juices to the pan. Anything ""leftover"" comes off super easy without much effort. Highly recommend these pans!"
"So far so good. Wish fry pans had lids. I have less expensive T-fal from the '70's. Still used. Held up great. These are so much better. I only use on Med Hi heat. Works great, even heat. I have had a set of Wofgang Puck Stainless Steel....hated it. Everything stuck. After what I paid, couldn't afford to get rid of them. Gave them to a friend. Then Got copper chef. Did everything it said, with the exception of even heating. I hated the square Pans. The corners didn't heat evenly. The center browned, not corners. I couldn't get used to square pans. Pan OK. I love having 5 fry pans. And extra sauce pans. The griddle is great. The price was great. I got from the warehouse. It was described as good condition. Orginal box will be damaged. When it arrived it was packed in an Amazon box. I thought Uh Oh. Opened took out factory box. It had a small gouge about 3"". Not through. In side everything was factory packed. Perfect. Happy Dance. Saved over $125."
"I love these pans! I bought them about two years ago and they are still in great shape. Nonstick is great, heat distribution is great. I take care to wash them by hand. Best pans I’ve had."
"After only receiving this product today I must say right out of the box I was impressed by its sturdiness. I followed all the directions and gave the set a quick wash and season. After this I tried the good old egg test to see if it would stick. To my astonishment the egg flipped easily without even using oil or even a spatula to assist. I was then able to wipe the little bit of residue off with a paper towel that was dry. The only complaint if any as of now is that the ring did not turn fully red, but it was significantly redder than the cool pans. I do believe if left longer to preheat it would have turned even more, but I did not have the patience. As of now this is definitely a 5 star product and holds its on against the more expensive sets. I will re-review in a couple of months to see if my opinion has changed."
"Mom used to love her one, two T-Fal brand cookware and with this in mind, I purchased this set. It is all that and some! Having now owned the set for over 3 months, I can honestly say that it's a joy to cook again with all the options available. Steamed veggies? Not a problem for the steam basket and pot. Perfect eggs or egg if you wish? From the smallest to the bigger frying pans, even heat distribution guarantees a great omelet or sunny side up egg(s). I love the big, wide Dutch oven which is wonderful for potatoes, pasta, stew or any big meal item and have even started cooking more since getting this beautiful set delivered.  Big tip, listen to the reviews on here and don't use ""high heat"", it suffices to use medium heat to get the best end result and the pots, pans stay beautiful. I use a scrub sponge to clean after use and no issues, no scratches. Let's just say, I am looking forward to using this set for many, many years!"
"I gave this set ""5 stars"" for durability but in all honesty, I've only had it 3 months now so the most used item has maybe 20 dishwash cycles on it. So far, everything still looks and cooks like when I unboxed it. I noticed right away how much more evenly and completely the cookware heats. I like the feature of the T-fal emblem changing shades to tell you when the pan is properly pre-heated. And heat transfer is far superior to the crappy set I had. Water boils and food cooks quicker, for sure. Nice heavy handles with good gripping surfaces. They do get hot when you've had something simmering for hours, but that's to be expected. I had never owned a steamer or a griddle before but I use them both and I'm super glad I got a ""complete"" set of cookware with all the multi-use lids. No complaints with anything. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"I've owned my 17-pc set for nearly a year. Seasoned, as recommended, initially but haven't done so for months. If anything sticks, it rinses right out with a hot water swishing - never have to apply pressure to remove food residue. Cooking is even. The set looks great hanging from my husband's home-made rack. I've not seen a single scratch, but I try to always use wood or plastic utensils. This is the nicest cookware I've ever owned at 73 yrs old, and I expect it'll last til my cooking days are done. Still looks brand-new after heavy use for 10 months, and I'd buy it again any day! Don't believe the negative reviews, I think they're from competitors' families!"
"I ordered these pans after replacing my previous, very expensive set that we had. The previous set were scratching the surface and essentially ruined the glass top. After doing a ton of research it became clear that the pans I had were not meant for electric ranges and I needed a flat bottom.  Cost. I was impressed with the number of positive reviews this set got so I figured, for the price I could live with a mistake of this size. Seriously. It's less than $200 for all of this. 'Nuf said.  Packaging. The pans were packaged very well and didn't notice excessive waste in material. The box was deseptively small but it just kept producing pan after pan. It was incredibly light too, which made me nervous. Each pan is lightweight and easy to manage with a full meal inside.  The ""preheated"" indicator. I read a ton of negative feedback, so while it's cool in theory- I didn't have high hopes. I was wrong. It does exactly the job it's designed to do. I attached photos from my own experience.  Clean up. I read they're dishwasher safe and everyone has an opinion on that. Honestly clean up has been so easy on these pans I haven't felt the need or desire to wash them this way. Preheat the pan. Pay attention. You will feel the same way. So Sorry but no dishwasher help from me here.  Overall. I'm not really sure they'll last me forever But I would be okay investing this kind of cash for this kind of product every five years if necessary!!"
"I've had this 14 pieces cookware set for almost 2 months now and I've gotta say it's AWESOME!  I use this on a daily basis for anything you can imagine: from basic scrambled eggs to soups, creams, beans, rice and all proteins in every presentation. The pans will not disappoint in any way!! they can take anything I trow at them and at the end, easy to clean; you just gotta follow instructions and I'm sure they will last more than 5-7 years, easily.  Something that did happen to the sauce pan is that I left it with the stove pin on (electric stove, btw) for about 5hrs at mid heat with some tap water on (2 cups) to boil and forgot about it (quarantine while working and cooking at the same time: not a good combination). When I realized this, I went immediately to turn the stove pin off but the pan had already taken some damage: all water had gone evaporated and the pan got burned in the inside making the minerals from the water to get embedded on the pan. I honestly don't blame the pan's quality AT ALL. All I'm saying is that this things could happen if you let them happen. Read the instructions on the booklet and follow them correctly. There's nothing fancy about them, just good old, very logical and common sense basic rules.  BEST COOKWARE SET I'VE EVER HAD AT A GREAT PRICE.!"
"I loved these so much I bought 2 sets and they worked so well I bought their bake ware also. With halfway decent care they will last forever. I also go the big frying pan and 7 qt pot in addition to these. I cook then bake my omelets under the broiler and they are perfect. Those that got theirs that had no thermal spot or were not in a T-fal box was from the particular sender were probably counterfeit and were not genuine T-fal.If not in the original box send them back. I love mine and so will you. Hand wash. Occasionally,re-oil the pans,and take care of them. Better than Gotham steel or Blue diamond pans as I have both."
"One can easily spend a lot of money on Non-Stick pans at the big box store. Why do it? These pans are amazing! They look great, they OWN the stove top, easy to clean, and they last. I finally gave in and purchased another pair last month. The old set preformed for me 5 years without a negative. These sport an awesome handle that is very comfortable. I highly recommend them to cooks at any skill level!"
"This 17-piece set of cookware is a really great value (for what I paid for it--the Amazon price can fluctuate quite a bit, even during a single day, so you may have to check the price periodically until it hits your price point). The set is very well packaged and arrived without any damage whatsoever, not even a minor cosmetic scratch,. ding, or mar. The fry pans and saute pan are fairly thick aluminum, and distribute heat well. The pots are a bit thinner walled, but they don't need to be as thick to perform their function. The exterior and bottom are also very smooth, which I like, as it won't scratch my glass cooktop. So far, these pots and pans are very easy to clean. No issue with anything sticking. Other reviewers have complained that their fry pans were not perfectly flat--well mine aren't either, but it's a distinction without a difference; they're flat enough. They are flatter than my old set of fry pans, which I never had any issue with--I never even thought to check this until I read some of these reviews. So, yeah, perfect flatness doesn't really make much, if any, difference to their intended function. My only critique, and a mild one at that, is that the Thermo Spot Indicator is kinda gimmicky--yeah, it does change shade when it gets hot, but it never really becomes completely uniform (where the pattern essentially disappears). So it is only marginally useful."
"Usage of a product like this is important to avoid scratching or scorching a nonstick, you should avoid preheating while empty, high heat or forks. When using sprays and grease can leave a residue on non-stick pans that is difficult to remove and the way you clean it is very important. Its difficult to care for pans. These pans seem to be very smooth with eggs just like most nonstick pans even sausage and gravy in big pan, iv seen messed up pans in well over 200 places [work]. If anything I can change my reveiw based on their holding. 5 years for most nonstick but it was set to price 300 so 4?"
"Wifey wanted a new pot and pan set, she said she needed one, as she does most of the cooking. Needless to say, I picked a winner. She loves it. This set has it all. AND the easy to clean portion is a winner for me. I researched multiple different brands/sets. From online to department stores I chose this one and glad I did. Pros: Wife cooks more (she is a killer, good cook) Durable Even heat distribution Cleaning is easy  Cons: Makes me want to cook more  Family of 4 and we seldom eat out. We use some items 3 or 4 times a week and the others once or twice a month so it has everything we need and then some. 5star."
"My very knowledgeable friend recommended this brand. I did a great deal of research and found this brand, type of new and improved non-stick ware. Approved for glass top stoves. Has vents in lids and rubber handles to prevent burns. Cooks well and cleans easily. My husband is the cook and he very much likes it. I also bought a set of wooden spoons as suggested to protect the cookware."
"I bought a set of these because I wanted hard anodized cookware without the heavy-weight of them. I have very bad arthritis in my hands and cannot always handle the weight of the pans filled with food.  These fit the me perfectly. I have always used 'all-clad and calphalon. I still use them. But on bad days these are the next best thing.  Bought a set of these at Christmas for my son. He was so thrilled , when he went home he washed them immediately.  Will definitely buy again if I need a nice present."
I really love this cookware it met all my expectations. Easy to clean and I read all the instructions about keeping them in great shape. The only downfall was I wanted to see them in person at the store before purchasing but I could not find them in the store so when I came back to order them on Amazon the price was $50 more than I originally saw so I had to purchase the 14 piece instead of the 17 piece that I wanted. What a disappointment.
So I just got my set today and I'll be updating my review as time goes by. As many reviewers have already stated it comes in a regular brown box. There was no damage inside and all the pieces seems very solid but not overly heavy. I plan on hand-washing them mostly with occasional dishwasher use.  Update 1. Made some steaks w.o oil and 0 issues. Also made steaks with oil and again 0 issues. I hand washed after and inside looks brand new. Bottom has some discoloration.  Update 2: 1/14/18 : I used the smallest and mainly for eggs and they had stuff lipstick on it. You have to use a good layer of oil or spray to prevent it. I have a small brown spot I cant get off because I guess when I sprayed I missed a spot :/
"I will plan on updating this later to give you an idea on how well it holds up. But after 30 days of use, we are very impressed. Cooks evenly, cleans up real easy, and no non-stick spray is required. I do have two minor complaints. The first is that one of the handles is slightly loose. They are riveted on so there is no adjustment but it is very minor. The second complaint is that there is no lid to the smaller skillet. The large skillet and large fry pan have interchangeable lids but not the smaller one. This is not a deficiency since is never claimed to have a lid for it. But it should in my opinion. Both issues might knock down my rating by 1/2 star but since you can't do that, I'll keep it at 5-star. We would certainly recommend this to friends and family. Knowing all of this, I would still have purchased it. Great product for a good price."
"I was thoroughly impressed with this set after it arrived. This is just as easy, or maybe even easier, to clean that my old, cheap non-stick Teflon cookware. Since Christmas Eve, I've used every piece, even on high heat -- with no issues whatsoever...no warping, no flaking, no scratching, and the bottoms still look like they did when I first pulled them out of the box. I should note that they've all been used on a glass-top electric stove. All pots and pans feel very durable...definitely not cheaply-made! Just to make sure that you're reading the correct review for the correct item, this review is for the T-fal E765SH Ultimate Hard Anodized Scratch-Resistant 17-piece cookware set. I've also used metal utensils...again, with NO scratching, abrasions nor flaking. I highly recommend this product! If anything should change, I will update this review."
"This set of two nonstick pans are AMAZING! They are exactly what I was needing. Nothing sticks and I mean nothing. In fact I can brown ground meat or cook eggs and literally wipe the pan with a paper towel and it’s clean, like what?! I’ve been suffering with pans where everything sticks and Zi spend hours a week soaking and washing but not anymore! These pans are deep and my new favorite cooking essentials! There’s two in two different sizes (as shown on stove eyes in pics) and both are deep. Wow, I wish I had ordered these months ago! You can’t go wrong on these. Great product and great price! My old set is getting donated today!"
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.  UPDATE: First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking. - WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting. - NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability. - HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils.. - STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment. Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both. Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY."
"We've never owned a brand new set of dishes that we got for ourselves. We've always purchased something cheap when we needed to really replace and previous pot/pan. This time we decided we wanted a GOOD set of pots/pans and so far we are really enjoying these. Having the red T in the center with the dots to help show you when the pan is pre-heated and ready has been a big help in seeing that i've been getting some of my pans too hot. Cooking on lower temps seems fine. I will say this though, If you get the pan too hot, the foot can still semi stick to it, but not so bad that you'd need to worry. Cleanup has been nice and easy thus far, but i plan to re-review this after some time has passed."
I needed to replace a very worn skillet and after researching pans I decided that this two piece set was the right purchase. So glad I did. They are perfect. As with everything I read all the instructions which I am glad I did since it is stated that it is best not to use high heat so as not to damage the finish. No need since they heat so evenly it isn't necessary to have high heat. They clean up well and food doesn't stick at all as expected. I love having the two sizes. I am going to purchase another set for a gift.
"When I unpacked the pot & pans (which were well protected) I noticed the 10"" frying pan had a deep gouge in the coating. This clearly is a manufacturing issue.  I tried contacting the manufacturer but their voice mail said to fill out a form on their website so that's where it stands. I'm hoping for a quick response otherwise I'll return the entire set.  Update 01/19/20 The manufacturer had me return the set and Amazon sent a replacement. No problems with the new set. I'm very happy with the quality."

"Hello folks. I have been meaning to write a review about this product because when I saw some convincing reviews that this is a horrible product and showed pictures of how bad they were I almost did not buy them. It was the tone of the review though that had me think otherwise like maybe they were a competitor trying to steer me away. I also waited a year to write this review. so you can see what moderate use looks like. My interpretation of moderate is 6-10 times a week. the pots and/or pans get used. My wife and I both work so we normally cook enough on the weekends to so we have leftovers during the week. I have a gas range with the iron grates so these guys have no love on their bottoms.  We REALLY like this set. They are very light which is good but it is also something to be mindful of since it can easily go sliding on the stove top. After a few uses your mind adjusts so it does not happen very often. Each item is well balanced and the handle never gets hot to the touch. Unless you put them in the oven then you should use a oven mitt etc… Just like anything else you would use in the oven. They are very easy to clean. We do not put them in the dishwasher though. Being non-stick makes clean up a breeze! We use all types of utensils plastic and metal and we had our first little nick in the finish which I will point out in the photo. We have used it about a dozen times after that and it has not flaked or any change so I am not concerned about it. No issues with the lids. They are all still in perfect working order.  It is not perfect though. The biggest lid fits the biggest (10.25”) fry pan but the middle lid (8”) only fits the biggest pot and sauté pan but not the fry pan. it is annoying. 1st world problems, right? The rivets are not non-stick. those can take some work getting clean. Eggs in particular are a nuisance. Those are my gripes. that's it..  I take that back. My last gripe is the site page itself. They are reusing some pictures that do not reflect the T-Fal Titanium line. The best way to tell if you are buying the Titanium is that the base of the pan/pot will say titanium and the rivets will also be coated. That’s right folks they fixed my gripe in the titanium. I have the hard-anodized non-titanium version. I also have a 5-quart titanium sauté pan and the rivets are coated. That pan is perfect in my humble opinion just too big for normal everyday use.  The photos are as of 3-14-2017. I only took pictures of the most used items the two fry pans and a pot. All others are in even better shape! Hope my review helps with your decision. Why is my non-titanium review in a titanium product page? I do not know. When I went to past orders and clicked on it this is where it directed me to. Honestly though.. If I had the titanium line. it would be 5 stars."
"I got this T-fal set during the X-mas sales. It is a 100% great value for the money. So easy to clean, cooks so well, heat distribution is great, has the little red T-fal mark in the center of the skillets to show when they are how enough. It's very good quality entry cookware for anyone looking for an entire non-stick set. The only negative takeaway I have is that if I was going to do it again, I would really consider the Emeril set, the coating seems to be a little tougher on them"
"I love these pans they clean easy nothing sticks inside or out the secret is no hlgh heat I wash by hand i would never put these in the dishwasher they almost wash there self I highly recommend these pans after years of stainless steel and scouring pads to keep them shiny no more of it. Try them once you""ll throw the other ones out."
"This is my third lodge skillet. I typically use my 12 inch for everything, but I live alone, and this is perfect for eggs or grilled cheese. My biggest tip that I can give for lodge preseasoned cast iron---""wash it"" first. I don't use soap, but I use a stainless steel scrubber and hot water and thoroughly scrub the whole thing inside and out. I then dry it over medium heat on the stove, put a thin layer of oil all over the pan with a paper towel and then ""bake"" the cast iron in the oven at 450 degrees until it starts to smoke and stink. It kind of smells chemically. Once I smell it, I turn the stove off, let the cast iron cool in the oven, take it out, and it's ready to use. It may take a couple times before it's perfectly nonstick. Between each use I scrub it with the stainless steel scrubber and hot water and dry over medium heat on the stove. I rub more oil on it after drying about every 10th time I use it, or when it looks dry. I have never had to rebake it. My twelve inch has been perfect for years and this one is well on its way. So low maintenance. Great, heavy quality."
"I'm adding a photo in case anybody else was struggling to figure out what size to get! This is the 6.5 inch. It's the basically size of a regular napkin. I also put a large egg and a stick of butter in to show a comparison. I got it to make pizzookies in (""pizza cookies""), and I ordered too small at first. This size is perfect for me. Lots of people are complaining about the food sticking. I've used my skillets for cookies and eggs (mountain man breakfast), and it hasn't caused me any issues. In fact, my eggs didn't stick at all! (I did use butter in the pan, but I assume that's normal). Overall, great. I think I'll order 2 more to use with friends over!"
"We use this pan for everything except eggs. We've had this one for quite a while now so I feel like i can give a longer term review. The biggest thing I don't like about this pan is that it didn't feel like it came sufficiently pre- seasoned, so we looked up some videos and instructions and did it. Now it feels like the more we use the pan the better it gets. My husband and I both just Love this thing. The only thing it doesn't seem to cook right is eggs. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to cast iron, but once you figure it out, it's very enjoyable to cook on and the food comes out delicious.  Tips on how we seasoned it: there are lots of opinions on which oil to use but we just went with plain ole vegetable oil. We made sure the pan was clean, then covered it with a thin layer of oil. We put it in the oven as preheated it until 475 degrees. Once it came to temperature, we turned it off and just let the pan sit in there until it cooled. The goal is to ""burn off"" the oil, so bring it past the smoking point until it gets dry and hard on the pan. That's what makes it coat well. We did this 3 or 4 times, but the more you use it the better nonstick surface you'll have.  Tips: Don't wash with soap, it'll strip it. We purchased a chainmail scrubber that we love to use. Seems to help smooth it out a little too, but that might be in my head. When I clean it I only use the scrubber and hot water. The more I use the pan the easier it gets to clean. When you finish cleaning it, don't leave it wet. It'll rust. We just put it back on the stove with the burner on until it's dry. Easy. Keep in mind that cast iron doesn't exactly heat evenly, but it holds heat well. This just means that you have to sufficiently preheat the pan before you use to ensure even cooking.  Overall I love this pan! It just gets better every time I use it."
"I really love this cast iron 10 inch skillet from Lodge! I debated for a long time whether or not purchase one, For me, a purchase like this is about an investment, and I want my investment to last a long time.. I also really like the fact that this is made in the USA. American made products are just not easy to find anymore. But really, the proof in the quality of this cast iron was obvious when i made sweet potato corn bread and baked it in the oven in this skillet. It came out so nice and brown and moist. I'm enclosing pictures, so you can see the nice way it cooked the corn bread on both the top and bottom of the bread. Sorry, the pan in the first picture is a bit oily looking....I had cooked in the pan and then washed and oiled it. If you like this review, please click the helpful button under the review. It helps me to know if my reviews help people."
"At 58 years old I grew up using iron cookware and prefer to cook with it whenever possible. I have spent as much as $150 on a top name brand ""non-stick"" skillet only to be donated a year later to the thrift store! ~Never again.  I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance.  NEVER - Use soap or detergent on your iron cookware you'll ruin the seasoning with soap. If you do have a sticking when the pan has cooled add hot water only, allow to soak for about 15 minutes or so and clean as usual. Properly cared for your cookware should last your lifetime, be virtually non-stick and extremely low maintenance.  NEVER - Allow your cookware to air dry. This will cause rust and you will most likely need to scrub with steel wool, rinse, dry and re-season and you may to repeat this process many times to return it to a desirable condition.  Iron cookware can crack if exposed to extreme temperature changes / hot to cold. Food should never be stored in iron, it is for cooking and serving from within a short time period only.  I hope my long winded review/comment has helped in some way. I love my iron skillets. I'll be back for more pieces."
"I bought this skillet a little while ago and I was surprised how rough the surface finish was. It felt like sandpaper. Given all the positive reviews, I was expecting higher quality. After some research I found instructional videos on how to grind these Lodge skillets smooth, but who has time for that? I found two other American producers of cast iron that come with a smooth finish right out of the box: Stargazer and Finex. The Finex looks interesting but I went with the Stargazer because it's fully machined at half the price. Seems like I made the right call. The design is great, the surface finish is super smooth, and it cooks like a champ. If you're reading this review, do yourself a favor and pass on the Lodge. Go with the Stargazer instead. It's well worth the investment."
"I was worried the rough surface would cause sticking, but i have found it to be a non-issue. The pre-seasoning has some issues though. Its not hard to fix, but I don't think anyone should uses these pans as is. If you wipe a clean towel across it you will notice there is a black film. This is not how cast iron cookware should be. What you really need to do is:  1) Scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film 2) Wipe the pan dry with a dry towel. 3) Heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry. 3) Wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan. (any cooking oil is fine) 4) Wipe as much of the oil off as you can with a dry paper towel. What you want is an ultra thin coat of oil. 5) Bake the pan at 400-450 degrees for at least an hour, then let the pan cool inside the oven.  You should now have a well seasoned pan. If there is any black residue when you wipe it with a clean towel repeat the steps above, but it should be good to go after just one seasoning."
"I love this skillet! I've used it on the stove:gas and electric(on glass tops do not drag this skillet on it, it will scratch the glass) as well as over fire outdoors. I've owned it for 8 months now and it still looks as new as it did 8 months ago. Make sure to research how to clean your cast iron cookware and always heat them up to evaporate any surface moisture after cleaning before oiling. I've made many different foods in this, Utica Greens, bacon, eggs, steak, pizza...etc. All have come out perfect. Be aware this skillet is huge so make sure you have room to store it and it is also heavy...About 12 pounds I think, so my wife does have trouble moving it, I also need 2 hands to carry the sucker especially when its loaded with food! I would say I would buy this again, but I see this skillet lasting for ever!"
"If you haven't already taken the leap into cast iron you should think about it. First off the pan is cheap, durable and generally non-stick. Does this mean nothing will stick to this pan? No but if you have the right temperature and use the right amount of fat/oil when cooking and take care of this pan it will take care of you. I would say this pan excels at proteins first and foremost. I have cooked bacon, eggs and pancakes right after one another and nothing stuck to this pan. I would say vegetables are also a favorite in this pan as well because of the great flavor this pan helps create through the oil and char you can achieve with this pan.  If you are the type of person that cooks and then puts the pans in the sink for a later time then cast iron might not be for you but I have left this pan in a sink for a few hours or on the stove top overnight and cleaned the next day so it is worth a shot. If you are the type of person who lets pans soak in water overnight or puts them immediately into a dishwasher for cleaning then this pan is definitely not for you unless you are willing to make an exception with this pan.  Did I have immediate success with this pan right away? No I didn't. I had food stick and I had issues with cleaning the pan and reasoning the pan and had to look for advice on the internet to solve my issues because not many people use cast iron so I couldn't ask them.  Some of my mistakes were simple ones to make as I have always used either stainless steel or non-stick pans. I didn't wait long enough for the pan to heat up. Take it easy and heat this pan up on medium before you start cooking. Don't think this amount of iron will be hot in 5 minutes. You may need to wait 15 minutes to get this pan heated evenly but I would say put the pan on the heat before you start your prep. The next issue is using enough oil. You don't need a ton of oil but you should use a healthy amount. If you are frying then yea sure use a ton of oil but generally your food doesn't need to be swimming in oil but coat the bottom of the pan. I would advise against using black pepper on your steak if searing. The high temps will burn the pepper causing smoke and burnt flavor on your steak. You are better off using just salt before cooking and fresh cracked pepper afterwards. Acidic food like tomatoes are okay in the pan but make sure you have a well seasoned pan. I would stay away from sauces but cut up tomatoes in the pan for your first few uses should be fine. You need to build a good layer first before tackling sauces. This pan excels at bacon and frying so if you are in the mood to do either this pan will be your best friend. The pan is shallow so it isn't meant for deep frying but I have done fish and chicken where I had to flip and it worked great.  Also take care of this pan. Scrub it down with soap and water. Yes you can use soap I do all the time but I also rinse thoroughly and dry immediately over heat and spread another thin, thin, thin layer of oil on it too. Every other month or so I give it a good scrubbing and then apply a light coat of oil and stick in a 500 degree oven, upside-down for an hour or so and then turn off the oven and let it cool. This adds additional seasoning to the pan. You can overseason the pan which I have done and all I did was heat, scrub, wash which eliminated most of the excess seasoning. A salt scrub can help as well or if you really are in the weeds you can get a more aggressive scour pad and remove all the seasoning and start from scratch. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to strip and then dry. The time in the oven will be what takes the most time but at that point its set and forget. You just need multiple layers so it will need a lot of oven time like 6 hours or more depending on your diligence.  The best advice is keep cooking and don't be afraid to experiment, keep the temperature lower than you think you need and don't rush the food it will be done when it is done."
"I ordered this because I have a smaller lodge cast iron pan for years which I love and wanted a larger one to complement. However four months after purchase as I was heating up olive oil on medium High temp , while I was in the kitchen dicing gArlic for it , I heard what sounded like a gunshot and found that the pan split in two. Photo attached. Unfortunately it's past the return date. I'm disappointed because I had good experience with this product before and no explanation as to how a few minutes of heat could cause fracture. Had to toss the pan."
"Throw your money at amazon and never look back. I cook a great steak. I love cooking steak. Enter this cast iron skillet (shout out to my momma for the recommendation). Holy crap this thing rocks. I cook everything in this baby. You ever reheat pizza on a cast iron skillet? You ever get cold in the winter so you just heat up the skillet and let it sit in bed with you? Well I have, and I have the burn marks to prove it. I love this skillet, what a phenomenal purchase."

"Perfect for egg muffin sandwiches, it's the right size and height after cooking compared to the ""Mc"" brand. It is the best I have found after many years of trying. If you have ever wanted to make your own egg muffin at home, this pan is the one to use."
"VERY heavy. Lots of TLC required. Versatile. Multi-generational. Reasonably priced. Lodge seasoned CI-made in USA.  First of all, for those of you who care about country of origin, rest assured that Lodge seasoned cast iron is made in the USA (the enameled Lodge cast iron however, is made in China).  Before I delve into the review of this LCI, let me just warn my readers that CI is rather heavy! If you have arthritis or a weak arm and had, you may want to consider a lighter-weight cookware.  Now on to the “meat” (pun intended) portions of this review…  Cast iron is a forgiving but high maintenance mistress! She will forgive almost anything (even allowing her to rust!!!), but she does require a little TLC before, during, and after each use. The TLC she needs is:  1. Before using: season CI 1) Cast iron must be seasoned before any use; luckily, Lodge double seasons its cast iron so that customers may use the product right out of the box, but if you need to re-season the cast iron product, follow these steps: i) Scrub CI well in hot soapy water. ii) Dry thoroughly. iii) Spread a thin layer of oil (I like avocado oil, but vegetable or canola will suffice) over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts). iv) Place CI upside down on a middle oven rack and turn on the oven and allow to heat to 550°. (PLEASE refrain from placing the CI into an already heated oven; the CI heat gradually in the oven as the oven works its way up to 550 degrees F) (1) ***NOTE: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). v) Place foil on a lower rack to catch drips. vi) Once the oven temperature reaches 550 degrees, “bake” the CI for 50-90 minutes. vii) Turn off the oven and allow the CI to cool inside the oven. ***Reminder: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). 2. During usage: use a “fatty food” the first time you use the CI implement. a. Personally, I love any excuse to fry bacon, so I always “break-in” my CI with bacon slices; however, there are many amongst you who are unable to partake in bacon for religious, moral and ethical, or environmental reasons. For those amongst you who cannot use bacon, cook a food that requires deep frying. b. Pre-heat the CI before using (every single time) or your food will stick and crumble i. NOTE: Although I ALWAYS pre-heat my CI for cooking, I rarely do so for cake-baking; for cake-baking I used a very liberal amount of my home-made pan release “goo” to fully coat the pan, and I pour the cake batter right into the pan; works every time! 3. After using: wash and re-season (NO, not the detailed steps mentioned above) a. After using the CI, and while it is still hot, wash using scorching (wear heat resistant gloves as to not burn your hands) water and salt (refrain from using chemical cleaners) i. NEVER wash in a dishwasher (OMG) b. Dry completely and thoroughly c. Spread a thin layer of oil over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts) and place the CI on the stove top to heat for about 10 minutes d. Store CI in a moisture free environment i. NEVER store food in CI ii. NEVER store CI in fridge or freezer  So that is the TLC required for a CI pan or pot, but there are still several things to keep in mind:  A. NOT everything should be cooked in cast iron! (1) Avoid cooking acidic foods in CI (yes, it is okay to finish the dish with a small squeeze of lemon (not when skillet is hot) or a few drops of vinegar, it is okay to add tomatoes and tomato paste to the dish you are cooking, but it is NEVER okay to stew tomato prolonged periods, deglaze with vinegar, or lemon juice to foods while they were still hot on the skillet) (2) Avoid (at least in the beginning when your cast iron is still getting TLC) sticky foods (fried eggs, omelets, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fried rice, crepes, etc.) as they will definitely stick to your CI; this is not to say that you will not eventually be able to fry eggs or make crepes on your CI, I do all the time, but you will need to have reused and reasoned you CI many times before it becomes fully non-stick. (3) Avoid cooking delicate fish (flounder, tilapia, etc.) In CI because the delicate fish will not tolerate the heat retained by the CI (an asset when searing steak) and will fall apart when flipped. (4) Avoid (particularly before your CI becomes super well-seasoned) using the same pan for savory and sweet as the CI does retain flavors; in other words, using the CI to bake a vanilla cake immediately the day after using it to make garlic chicken may make your vanilla a tad too garlicky! (5) Avoid using CI to cook foods that require lengthy periods of simmering, boiling, or steaming as the lengthy simmering, boiling, or steaming will strip your CI of its hard-earned seasoning.  Are you still reading? If after reading the previous portions of this review, you are concerned about the TLC necessary to maintain CI, then I really recommend you consider other cookware options. (Caphlan non-stick is a viable alternative); if on the other hand, you are still reading, then you are not dissuaded from investing in CI cookware, and I am glad of that!  There are numerous benefits to cooking and baking in CI: 1) Cast iron is extremely sturdy and is very difficult to ruin. (If you do ruin a CI pan, you can restore and reclaim it!). 2) Cast iron heats up evenly and retains heat incredibly well, which makes CI excellent for searing meat, baking corn bread, making pies, baking crusty bread, etc., and for keeping food warm as you serve it! 3) Cast iron is healthy; yes, that is true! During the cooking process a trace amount of iron is absorbed into the foods, and when the foods are consumed by you, you are getting some iron into your system (a healthy by-product of CI cooking). 4) Cast iron is quite versatile. You may use CI for almost everything (you make slow cook a lamb leg to perfect or make a three-layer birthday cake for your daughter in CI). Additionally, CI goes from cupboard, to stove-top, to oven, to camp-fire, and to dinner table! Talk about versatility! 5) Cast iron is of heirloom status; it lasts for generations! I personally have a huge collection, and I plan to bequest my CI to my daughter (it shall be written in my will-not kidding).  So, to re-cap: CI is a rather heavy type of cookware that offers great versatility, heats evenly, retains heat well, requires pre-seasoning and re-seasoning, and is multi-generational. And, of course, Lodge is an excellent CI brand. Lodge was founded in 1896 and is one of the very few remaining companies that still produce seasoned CI in the US (in the Lodge foundries in Tennessee). Lodge products are sturdy, versatile, heirloom-quality, and of course reasonably priced (as compared to the more expensive companies).  I have been using CI (especially Lodge) for two and one-half decades (yes, ¼ of a century) now, and I will NEVER use anything else! A purchase of Lodge CI cookware and bakeware is a very sound investment indeed!  **If you found this review of use, please “like” using the thumbs-up button below.

"I don't even need to review this product because there are so many people who already give it high ratings. But I felt the need to anyways.  I have owned cast iron in the past, and honestly, I didn't get it. Everyone was always raving about how amaaaazing it was and how it's sooooooooo good for non stick. And I would see videos of people sliding eggs out of the iron like it was a non stick pan. I bought a FANCY iron skillet from a high name brand, and I was like....what? What was I doing wrong?  EVERYTHING. WOULD. STICK.  I basically called BS on the whole thing. I then went online and learned all this special care for iron and how you ahve to never use soap, and not be too abrasive or you'll remove the seasoning, and basically all of these things where I wa slike....okay. So.....my food burns onto it, and then.....I can't use soap or an abrasive scrubber to remove it? So....what universe is everyone else living in????  So I gave up on cast iron and happily went back to my anodized non-stick set.  Well after a few years I visited a friend and was cooking at her house. I learned that ALL she had was a full set of Lodge Cast Iron.  THE HORROR.  I was floored with fear because I am a great cook and was 1000% expecting to burn everything to her pans and destroy them.  The cooking, changed my life that day. It was SO. EASY.  Her pans were so enjoyable to cook on that I immediately went home and ordered a Lodge skillet. I was still nervous about it, but at the low price, who cares! I am privileged enough that I can afford to spend $30 to see if I like a pan without going broke.  It arrived, and it's been a life changer. The cleaning is not that hard at all, I do avoid soap but I got a brush to clean it with and all is well. I cook only using butter or bacon fat and the extra savory taste that all of my cooking gets from this pan and it's seasoning is just miles and miles beyond that of my non-stick. I have gone from using a full 12 piece set, to basically only using one ceramic non-stick pan about 25% of the time, and my one Lodge skillet 75% of the time. The best. I want a smaller one too."
"We bought both the larger and smaller sizes. We've had other iron skillets in the past and have to say these are very high quality. Beware, they are heavy. My wife and I were not all that impressed with the manufacturer's pre-seasoning and suggest that you season yourself with a high temperature vegetable oil. Place a thin coating of the oil on the inside of the skillet, heat oven to 350, place skillet in the oven for 1 hour. Turn oven off after 1 hour but leave skillet in the oven until it has cooled. You're ready to go!"
"I love cast iron, got this pan cleaned it with hot water and corse salt, then heated it till all the water was gone, and then applied a tsp of Crisco today I used it to do a small batch of scrambled eggs work just fine. If you treat cast iron right it will last three or four life times follow these rules and you will be happy for years to come.  Lodge Cast Iron CLEANING  I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance."
"This is a BIG skillet! Be sure you want to go this big. I'm single, so I'll rarely need this size. The cute little red handle cover...well, I'm not impressed. Bottom line: whatever I may have used this for, I'll probably still use my big crock pot, and it has a lid. Walmart has these same Lodge items...at better prices. UPDATE, SAME DAY... I just checked my recent Walmart flyer, and ordered 2 skillets, made by Lodge, that I can use, for $10 less that the $42 I paid for this one, that is too big for my oven!!! Returning this one due to high price! UPDATE 21 OCT...I started the return process, was given the options to refund or exchange, opt'd to refund. They're charging me $10+ to return it...wonder what if I exchanged it? Walmart has this exact same skillet for $19.92, it's a ""no brainer"", even when it's costing me $10. AMAZON, I'M NOT VERY HAPPY WITH YOU TONIGHT!!! 22 OCT., I may just keep it!"
"I've ordered two of these 12"" Lodge cast iron skillets from Amazon over the years. The first one I bought years ago for me to use and, more recently, another one for my son's first apartment after college.  For the price, I don't think you can beat cast iron skillets from Lodge. If you google ""best cast iron cookware,"" you'll generally find Lodge listed at the top or at least as one of the favorites by different consumer research sites and publications such as Cooks Illustrated even when compared to cast iron at many times the price.  The only cast iron cookware that I find to be of better quality than these are those manufactured many decades earlier. I have a couple of smaller Griswold cast iron skillets made around 1930-1940 and there's a definite difference. Good quality vintage cast iron cookware is generally thinner walled and slightly lighter in weight. Many of the older pieces also have a raised bottom ridge, or smoke ring. However, the biggest difference IMO is the smooth, polished surface on the vintage pieces. Modern-day manufacturing of cast iron skillets (like these by Lodge) tends to leave a slightly pebbled surface. Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to find smooth-finish vintage cast iron cookware that's in good condition. And, when you do, it's usually quite expensive.  An ultra-hot cast iron skillet is my very favorite for searing thick tenderloin steaks and salmon. I put the skillet (minus silicone holder) into a 500° oven for about 10 minutes to heat it. Then I apply a dry rub seasoning to both sides of room temp steak filets or to top side of salmon fillets. Remove hot skillet from oven (extremely hot, so be careful), place on high flame or burner, and immediately place steaks or salmon onto skillet surface to sear to the degree of browning and crispness desired (usually just takes 1-3 minutes). Flip to other side to sear and then place back into still-hot oven to finish cooking. Amount of time in oven will depend on thickness of steak and/or fish and degree of ""done-ness."" Salmon and other meaty fish don't take long and, since we eat our steaks rare or med-rare, it usually doesn't take more than several minutes in the hot oven to finish.  While the pre-seasoning on these skillets (Lodge uses soy-based vegetable oil) is a nice way to start out without having to do that time-consuming step before using, you'll find that the surface of your skillet just keeps getting better and better. For many things, I find them to be every bit as non-stick as a teflon coating.  For cleaning, I use a scraper if I need to remove anything stuck on, but rarely does that happen. I never use detergent on mine. Instead I use hot water and a scrubbie to clean. Always be sure to thoroughly dry cast iron pieces so that no rust develops. And never ever put them in the dishwasher!  The silicone handle cover is a nice addition for use on top of the stove. While it can handle some oven temperatures, I remove it before placing in a 500° oven since that's higher than the recommended temp for the silicone."
"I was looking to replace my Tramontina 14"" Nonstick Fry Pan which was getting old and the nonstick had lost it effectiveness after almost 8 years even though I used it only occasionally. I like a big pan for family meals or when you just need the room such as making multiple pancakes in the same pan. nonstick/teflon pans are simple to use but they are not made for high heat and the nonstick coat will only last for a few years then it needs to be replaced. I mainly use a large pan for braising or frying meats and vegetables and sometimes adding sauces to them once cooked, like when I cook chicken thighs until browned and then drain oil and add teriyaki sauce to finish the dish. I was going to get another nonstick pan but I have recently started using my Cast Iron pans more so I decided to get the 13.25"" Lodge Skillet at under $40 it is a fantastic deal. I was happy with the size, but beware it is a very heavy pan so my wife can only move it with two hands. Cast iron requires care and knowing how to wash and prevent staining and rust, a few extra steps will keep it great shape and you will have a pan that last decades. I have also seen people doing extreme re-seasoning on these pans to make the sandy texture perfectly smooth on the cooking surface, they are stripping or sanding these pans down. My experience after using this pan for many meals is that it works Great, and there is no need to go to the trouble of resurfacing it. What I did was Wash the pan thoroughly when I received it with warm water and dish soap (this is the only time dish soap is required) and then put it on a medium flame to finish drying it for a few minutes, while it is still warm (carefully) add buzzywaxx or crisbee seasoning all over the pan in a (very very thin coat), put your pan in the oven for 1 hour at 400 degrees and let cool afterward in the oven for another hour, once the pan is cool put a very thin coat of canola oil on it, and your pan is ready to store or cook with! It should be nonstick for the most part but you have to some cooking skills to properly use the pan in accordance with the food your cooking. After cooking just use hot water and a soft brush to clean thoroughly, dry pan and heat on a medium heat until completely dry and let the pan cool then apply a very thin layer of canola oil before storing it. I have cooked eggs, pancakes, meats with sauces, french fries, country potatoes, fajita steak etc... and I have had no problems with cooking or sticking, just great food and a pan that will last forever."
"I am surprised, this was sold by Amazon not a third party. It has a Lodge label, but it does not match the design of a Lodge 10.25"" skillet as it has no secondary handle. It has no Lodge forge marks on the skillet. It also did not come with a silicon handle holder.  This is a cheap Chinese knock off. It is not even 10.25"" in diameter. Sending back."
"Let me say this. I already had a perfectly good 10"" cast iron pan. I did not need a replacement. But when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. I did not want to live life with my plain-bottomed cast iron pan, only to one day die of regret, knowing what might have been. Having this pan, and knowing that it has a classic US coin design on the bottom, makes me want to cook something. And for the cost - a couple of beers at the local pub - I can look forward to years of owning this one perfect thing that pleases me immensely. If you like cast iron pans, and you like classic US coin designs, do not hesitate to buy this. If you know someone who collects coins and eats food, do not hesitate to buy this as a gift. It's a quality pan with a timeless design. God bless you Lodge. God bless us all."
"I carefully read many reviews for cast iron skillets. I had a budget and didnt want to go over it AND I wanted made in USA. Things like this I dont trust Chinese manufactured. There were a few negative comments but for the budget minded and made stateside I pulled the trigger. I inspected it on arrival. Some reviews mentioned it had a rough surface. Mine was very smooth. No signs of any cracks. Yes its pre-seasoned but I seasoned it anyway. Have used at least 4 times and every time have had no sticking, no cracking. After use I wait for it to cool down to ambient temp then I wash it with dawn and sponge. No need to scrub as I havent had anything stick to it yet. I immediately dry with a cloth then apply a few drops of EVOO and work it into the surface with my fingers. Only needs a few drops!! Then I hang it on my pot/pan rack. So far its my favorite pan"
"I've recently gotten back into using Cast Iron. I got a good deal on this one as a ""scratch and dent"" / Amazon Return. I'm not sure where the scratch or dent is / was, but it works like it should.  One thing to keep in mind is that this thing is HUGE. No really, it's bigger than you were thinking. That poses two ""problems"" for the average kitchen user, that aren't reasons to take stars away.  1) This is heavy and (like all Lodge cast iron) has a tiny handle. You'll want to use two hands to move it around once it's hot and is full. Fortunately it has a second handle. Be sure to use oven mitts, welding gloves, or something else to protect your hands, because once it is hot, it is going to STAY hot for a while.  2) Did I mention it's HUGE?! So big in fact that the burners on my kitchen stove don't heat the entire pan very well. You'll want to spend some time (5-10 minutes at least) pre-heating this on a medium low setting before cranking up the heat, and even then you'll probably have a hot spot in the middle, and cooler temps out at the edges. This isn't an issue if you're cooking over a large burner camping / expedition type stove, but burner size should be factored in."
"Bought this Lodge 10-1/4 "" skillet in 2012 from Amazon . It has been well used and is holding up just fine . It cooks everything from roasted potatoes and carrots to baking bread in the oven . Have had no issues with any rusting and rarely have to season it . I do clean it right after each use with hot water , dry it and then coat it with a bit of oil . this pan has now many memories of many family meals . I was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as I did not want a pan that everything sticks to and would be hard to clean . I am really glad I took a chance and got this pan . The non-stick pans that would stick after the teflon started wearing off no matter how careful you were taking care of them , and required being replaced every year have nothing on cast iron . Once your cast iron is well seasoned it is non stick . I paid about $15.00 for this skillet and five years , 7 months later it is in perfect condition and likely will never need replacing . In the same time prior to having cast iron the non stick skillets would have to be replaced yearly . I also bought the lodge cast iron griddle , in fact bought that one first a year before buying this skillet . The cast iron griddle is the best for cooking pancakes . Before that pancakes never cooked right . I also really love that Lodge is Made in America. I have since purchased many more Lodge Cast Iron pans for myself and to give as gifts to others So far all the Lodge Cast Iron purchased have worked just fine. Yes Cast iron takes a small bit of care but it really is not hard to maintain . It keeps food hot a long time and I love that about Cast Iron, going back for second helpings out of cast iron your food is still hot enough to not need to be reheated . Buying the Lodge cast iron serving dishes for that very reason . It is not delicate , it is rough and rugged and will last a lifetime ( Lodge even gives a lifetime warranty on their cast iron ) I read some of the reviews that were saying the quality of Lodge had gone down . I only know that we just bought two of the 8"" skillets and two of the 2 quart pans with lids and they seem of the same great quality as this skillet bought years ago .Thank you Lodge for the wonderful Cast Iron cookware and Thank you Amazon ."
"Awesome skillet! No complaints. It's a larger pan so if you're looking to cook two eggs it might be a little overkill. Two 1lb New York strips fit perfectly with room to spare for some aromatics. There's some reviews talking about food sticking and sending the pan back because of that. I took the time to season this pan twice before I ever attempted to put food into it. The steaks didn't stick and cooked just fine. The mashed potatoes stuck some but I fully expected that to happen. Afterwards during cleaning it flaked right off and barely required any scrubbing. I fully expect this pan to last well beyond my life time and will be given to my kids who will probably throw them in the back of the cupboard, oh well. For $40 it's a helluva deal for a brand new piece. Without a doubt I'll be buying a smaller size for smaller breakfast type stuff. Again take the time to understand how to use cast iron and how to care for it and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for instant gratification, stick with something teflon coated."
"FREAKING TINY! listen up... Here's what you do. You pop an oversized biscuit in it... Cut the biscuit top of at the 1/2 way mark in cooking. Drop an egg with crumbled cooked Bacon on it. Put the top back on. 12 minutes later... Bacon egg and cheese biscuit! All in one time Skillet!!! I love to use this Skillet to make garlic, thyme, butter sauce, for steak! It needs to be cared for like any other cast iron skillet. It needs to be seasoned like any other cast iron skillet. It actually.... Uhhhh... Kinda cute."
"I wanted to get away from PFAS laden teflon so I went back to the basics - cast iron - for my eggs every morning. This is the perfect size. I read another review that said they can't get eggs to come out right on this and I am thoroughly confused. My eggs are perfect every morning. You do need to use enough oil, especially at the beginning, and make sure it seasons appropriately. The description says it is pre-seasoned but I find that it takes a few months to really get good. I still use a small amount of oil every day but much less than I used at the beginning. Overall this is exactly what I was looking for and I love it!"
"Was only missing a 10"" size skillet in my Lodge cast iron fry pan cookware and only purchased those with scenery on bottoms! Look for the wildlife series by Lodge if you don't have. Love this addition to my very useful pans. Sometimes my ""Boy Scout"" symbol 12"" Lodge pan is too big or I need two pans going at once for different items. My other 10"" was a square grilling pan from the wildlife series so this is a nice addition. Arrived in great condition but did want to rust when I put it away first time as ""my bad"" I did not oil first before putting away and I know better 😞 . I feel better buying a product made in the USA! Don't mind paying more and the detail in these pans leaves you with pans that are heirloom and will be enjoyed by many for generations. PS, remember strength training is the best exercise for your bones as you get older so don't let the weight of these pans be anything but one more thing to keep you healthy. 😆"
"I bought this on a whim because of its small size. After I got it I was a bit shock at just how small it was. However , I pushed on. I went ahead and seasoned it a couple of times (pre-seasoning is just the start of the process , not the end point, then again there is no real end point in seasoning) and decided to fry an egg. The little pan worked great. I don't believe there is any spatula that would work with this but if you like your fried egg sunny side up you are golden. However, I like mine 'over easy'. That required a flip onto a plate and a slide back into the skillet. This worked great because the seasoning process had made it very non-stick. It was a pretty good fried egg. Perfect size for an Egg McMuffin. I find that each time I see this Lilliputian skillet on my stove, I giggle at how cute it is. I could be used as a spoon rest as well."
This is a quality pan and became totally nonstick after a few seasonings. Reasonably priced and made locally. This pan will last forever with proper care. Picture shows a batch of latkes in action.
"Updated Review:  I see a ton of reviews that just show people treating and using their cast iron the wrong way so I'm here to set the record straight.  If your pan comes and the surface finish is a little rough, that's fine! You have a few options. You can strip it down and re-season it (This is my recommendation. I never like to trust the factory seasoning), you can just use it the correct way and it will eventually come out smooth as butter, or you can give up right then and there and send in a 1 star review.  #1- Follow the steps to season your pan, but do some google research! There are people out there that have used these things for their whole lives, and their grandparents used the same ones before them. If you season it correctly and care for it correctly, your pan will never die.  #2- Slow heat!! This one is very important! Don't turn your burner to medium-high, throw a pat of butter down and spread some pancake mix. In the words of the illustrious South Park ski instructor, ""You're gonna have a bad time"". Start your heat on low, let your pan warm up evenly and then start to cook on it.  #3- Regardless of what people say, unless you're seasoning your pan, there's no need for soap. It won't necessarily hurt (Lodge even says specifically just to avoid high amounts or strong soap) but you don't need it. Run your water in your sink on hot, rinse the pan off, wipe it with a brush, use a stove burner on low to dry the pan and, if you want, put a very very thin layer of oil (crisco is my preference, just wipe off any excess oil after you apply the thin layer) on the pan and you're good to go for next time. You won't die from anything you previously cooked on the pan.  #4- If your pan cracks or has an issue, contact Amazon/Lodge and they will replace it.. These things are prone to damage in transit simply because it's cast iron. This isn't some stainless steel pan coming in the mail. If you hit the pan against something or it gets damaged in transit, just ask for a replacement instead of posting a poor review. (On that note, these pans are ground on the edge due to the casting process. If your edge is a little rusty, scrub it with some steel wool, season it and you'll be cooking in no time.  I'll stand by these pans. I've treated mine right and they've been the best pans I've ever owned.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  As these reviews cover a variety of Lodge pan sizes, I'll post about all of the ones I have!  I can't say enough how incredible cast iron pans are. They cook flawlessly, they clean up in under a minute and they're versatile! (I season them with a thin layer of Crisco and it works great every time).  I use the 3.5 inch pan for eggs! A sliver of butter in the pan (while it's sitting in a larger pan for nice heat distribution and the ability to easily cover) on medium heat for a few minutes makes a great egg!  The 6.5 and the 8 inch pans I use for a ton of different things but the tastiest thing is a nice warm skillet cookie!  I use my 10.25 inch pan mainly for smaller single size dishes and (even better) pie! Melted butter and sugars in the pan to start and the pie comes right out! The fact that you can put them in the oven just opens so many doors for cooking!  Cast iron is hands down my favorite and I can't wait to have them around my entire life!"
"It's excellent Lodge is still actively making cast iron skillets, as most people that have used one before understand why it's superior at doing what it does, but if not, the maintenance horror stories are enough to scare away new-comers. Yes, it's a bit pricey compared to the Teflon Madonnas at the retail stores, but it's worth every penny. This pan came pre-seasoned, so literally it was a quick wash, and straight to business. Quick wash of water after, throw some Kosher salt in and give a once over with the dish sponge, dry it good, back on the stove to completely dry, then grab some good quality oil, light coat, wipe away excess, and prepare for the next meal. After a while, it's too easy, but the non stick and the ability to cook high fat foods in their own juices; can't beat it"
"Lodge remains on the top of the cast iron game. This 12"" skillet is heavy with no false rim that gives the appearance that sides and bottom are thicker than they are. The skillet has an even but course surface which is perfect for the seasoning to build upon and won't come off when using a steel spatula. (Btw: years ago I bought a milled/super smooth skillet and never again). The bottom of the Lodge skillet is perfecty flat with no annoying rim to hang up on a burner grate and allows for good contact with flat cooktops. The skillet holds a very even cooking heat at all temperatures. The skillet comes pre-seasoned, however, I hit the skillet with a coat of flax-seed oil and baked it on in a 425 oven for a couple hours. Kudos to Lodge for kicking out one of the best performing skillets out there."
"So, I haven’t cooked in cast iron in a good few years. Between moves and my busy lifestyle I’ve either sold or misplaced my skillets. So, what do I do when I need a new cast iron skillet? I go to the best of the best: Lodge. Made in Tennessee by hard working Americans, this cast iron is the best of all the skillets I’ve tested. You can tell the quality and effort made in producing a cooking medium that will last a life time. It’s pre-seasoned with food grade oil in the final stages of the factory process. It came in excellent packaging and right on time. The heat dispensation and retention is excellent. Just make sure you don’t grab the handle unprotected during use. Once I received it, I immediately went to cooking. Let me say, this skillet has made me fall in love with cooking again! I’m a father of three young children that require a full, healthy breakfast and this skillet helps me do that. Shoot, I find myself preferring this skillet for everything. I look forward to cooking on it and will fondly look at it whenever I venture into my kitchen while my other pans gather dust. From meats to pancakes, this skillet is my go-to for it all. It’s non-stick capability is unmatched. Just season it periodically and clean it like advised. The only thing I wish is that I had more of their cast iron kitchen utensils! This is not a paid review. This is my emphatic, pleased response from a product that was made with as equal of passion. I encourage anyone researching cast iron to go ahead and purchase something from Lodge. You can even go online and look at videos of their manufacturing process. You can’t go wrong here!  With that, I conclude this review. I’m off to use my cast iron skillet again!"
"Okay.  So you've bought a cast-iron skillet, so you're clearly prepared to put some effort in. First thing's first, you need to make your cooking surface smooth. Before you do any cooking in it at all, go out and buy a packet of the roughest sandpaper you can find, and then a couple sheets of 200 grit or so. Sand that bad boy until it's silky-smooth, clean it really really really well with soap and a gritty sponge, rinse it, then pop it in a hot oven to dry. Season it a few times with flaxseed oil or Crisco like our ancestors used to, then you're ready to go.  THIS THING IS AWESOME. I love it so goshdarned much. Lodge makes some of the lowest-cost iron around, and it punches WAY above its weight. It consistently rates among the heavyweights like Stargazer and Butter Pat, and the reason is pretty dang simple: Lodge gives a darn about making high-quality items that are a pleasure to use at a price point anyone can afford.  I love this skillet. If my house was on fire I'd have a hard time choosing between this skillet and my kids."
"I purchased the Lodge Cast Iron 10.25"" Skillet and was very happy with it that I later purchased a few of the 6.5"" skillets to use when camping. My review is the same for both sizes!  The first thing I did before using it was washing it in boiling hot water (no soap), and using a stainless steel scrubber. I then dried it and seasoned it by rubbing a generous coating of bacon fat all over the inside and out, placed it on a drip pan, then ""baked"" it in the oven for an hour at 475°F. I repeated this process every time I used it for the first few months, (mostly using coconut oil instead of bacon) and eventually it became slick and nonstick.  This skillet allowed me to produce crispy crusts on apple pies, gorgeously brown crusts on corn bread, roasted vegetables, crispy fried chicken and roasted whole chickens, quiches, and delicious frittatas, to name a few.  Unlike my experience with the Lodge Dutch Oven, there was no horrible metallic taste to foods and no rusting. The skillet is heavy duty, heats up, and retains heat well and was made in the United States.  Overall I highly recommend Lodge's Cast Iron skillet in both sizes. With great care and maintenance, the non-stick quality is as good as traditional non-stick pan, without the hazards! Grade A!"
"★★★★★ from California Transplant on October 2, 2017  I'm a Believer  I saw a recipe in a magazine for an Orange Thyme Upside Cake that was baked in a 12"" cast iron skillet. The side bar to the recipe rated this Lodge skillet as the top brand for cast iron. So I ordered one and made the cake per the recipe. The cake came out perfectly, not only in look and taste, but also in release from the skillet. My husband did help me turn the pan upside down onto the cake stand which I held up next to the pan as he turned it. (He wanted credit for his efforts.) And like the info in the listing said, this skillet was ready to use straight from the box. I did wipe it out first with a damp sponge and did not oil it as my recipe called for making a buttery topping in the pan and additional greasing/oiling would have been redundant. Clean up was a breeze. My parents had a big cast iron skillet that they cooked in regularly and I disliked it because it was so heavy and industrial looking. Now I think I understand their preference. Yes, it's heavy, but the additional lift handle makes picking it up much easier. And, of course, the weight is part of the reason the pan works so well. So, you might say that at long last, I have become a believer. I am thoroughly happy with my purchase of this Lodge skillet and look forward to using it many times in the future. I may even buy a smaller sized one as well!"
"Okay, so I waited a LONG time to review this, not purposely, but rather because I am going to buy a second one now and wanted to review!  After 2 years, I can confidently say this is a GREAT buy for a multitude of reasons. Cast iron pans are so versatile and if you take care of them, will last a lifetime.  First off, the seasoning it comes with is not the greatest. If you want, wash it off with warm water, some mild soap, and a wire/steel brush. Ensure you SEASON it after.  In the beginning (first 20 uses), I would highly recommend you SEASON after EVERY use. It may seem excessive but it pays off, trust me.  I prefer to use Flax-seed oil (not refrigerated), a rag (a few I have set aside only for this purpose) and a HOT oven. Go on youtube on how to properly season and do it religiously in the beginning. If you do it enough, afterwards you won't have to season every time (maybe every 3-5 times) and it'll have a beautiful non-stick layer.  For cleaning, I've learned the best method is the following:  1. Buy a Stainless Steel Chainmail Scrubber. 2. Buy heat-resistant gloves (I already had some for my BBQ) 3. Buy some regular sea salt if you don't have any (Mortons works well).  Now, here's the process:  1. As soon as you're done cooking in the pan, (food has been taken out), pour some salt into the pan (enough to cover the surface), throw the chainmail scrubber in there, and add about half a cup of water (enough to bring the water level to cover the entire bottom of the pan). Doesn't matter WHATS in the pan (eggs residue, fish, steak, chicken, sauce, etc.), this is the best way to start.  2. Turn the heat on your stove to Low and let the water and salt warm up in the pan. I usually let this stage happen while I'm eating.  3. When the water is hot and almost boiling in the pan, grab your heat resistant gloves and take the pan with the water, carefully, off the stove and over to your sink. While you're holding the pan with one hand, use your free hand to work the chain scrubber all over the pan and rinse under HOT water. If the pan is too heavy for you, you can let it rest on a heat-resistant mat on your counter or on your counter if you have marble/granite or any heat resistant counter-top.  4. As you work the chain scrubber on your pan, the salt and hot water should basically help get everything off the surface of the pan. Run the pan under hot water and keep scrubbing until it's clean. Never use dish soap to clean the pan.  5. Dry pan with specific tower or rag (this should not be a tower you would use for any other purpose as it will stain) and if you still want to dry more, put on stove top and turn on high for a few minutes to heat up the pan and evaporate any remaining water. Ensure your pan is DRY as any remaining water will RUST the pan.  6. Season if you need to.  All in all, excellent pan and after 2 years, still looks new following the process above. I've used it for eggs/breakfast, salmon, steak, fish, pasta sauce, potatoes, frying, and pretty much everything else and it's as good as day 1.  I've seasoned it enough now that without any oil, I can cook eggs on it and it will not stick. Though I never do this, as I like to throw in a little butter to fry my eggs in the morning!"
"I see all sorts of reviews on here about food sticking and rust forming, but IF you season your cast iron properly, this won't happen. Don't go by the labels of ""Pre-Seasoned"" either. Do it yourself! The first thing I do with my Lodge pans is sand the interior with 60 grit paper on a power sander to remove the rough texture, then wash it with hot soapy water, dry it out then place on an eye to heat ALL traces of water out of the pan. Then when it's too hot to touch, but NOT smoking, wipe down all surfaces with some Grapeseed oil. Pre-heat the oven to 400°F. 10 minutes after wiping the pans with the oil, remove any excess oil until it's ALMOST dry. Put the pan in the heated oven, upside down and leave it for an hour to bake. After an hour, turn the oven off and leave the pan inside to cool down naturally. That is one seasoning cycle. Do this approximately 4 or 5 times total and your eggs will slide right out of the pan. After this, NEVER use soap, otherwise you'll have you season at least a couple of times all over again.  Side note for first time cast iron users: ALWAYS pre-heat the pan! If you don't your food can stick even in the most well seasoned pan. That also goes for stainless steel!"
"I have been looking for a skillet that was the perfect size for two people (enchiladas in an oversized skillet is no bueno). This cast iron dream is great, and for the price, you really cannot beat it. Super heavy duty. Make sure to season the skillet prior to use, as it will get rusty otherwise immediately after you use it. If you don't know how to season a skillet, here are some skillet seasoning skills I shall bestow upon you:  -Scrub it in hot water with dish soap -Towel Dry (DO NOT AIR DRY) -Spray it with vegetable oil - just a little, enough to cover it -Wrap it in tin foil, turn upside down and onto the rack in your stove at 400 for 30 minutes -Let it cool -YOU ARE SEASONED!"
"This pan is amazing. If you have never tried cast iron, you should. I have used (far far more expensive) ""swiss diamond"" nonstick pans in the past, and while that doesn't scratch as easily as other nonstick pans, it still wears out. Even with a lifetime warranty, you still pay shipping when the screws wear out. This pan, on the other hand, is indestructible. I have left the heat on and forgotten about it, no problem. I can use a sharp metal spatula without worrying. The iron even seems to add a bit of flavor to the food. As for non-stickiness, the other day I cooked an egg in it with just a tiny bit of sausage grease. The egg didn't even try to stick. For cleaning, it is a breeze as you just run some water over it and brush off any gunk. If you find out a way to get something to stick to it, you can just put it in the oven to burn it off, and reseason. Try that with a nonstick pan.  Last but not least, this is the new weapon of choice if a burglar comes."
"First of all, these cast iron pans are extremely versatile and durable for cooking. Second of all, you don't have to worry about any PFOA or other types of coatings coming off in your food and you ingesting them in some way. Third. cast iron cooks extremely evenly, and does an amazing job in browning all type of foods.  Personally, I use it for cooking sliced fingerling potatoes in olive oil. The 10.25 size allows for more than enough potatoes, and doesn't require you to use a bunch of expensive olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan for frying. If you buy the pan, you'll have to try this -- the potatoes are easy to make and absolutely delicious. Also, for the issue of splatter - I've found that my Swiss Diamond glass lid fits pretty good - not perfect, but since I already have it, and I don't need to store yet ANOTHER lid, I highly recommend using another glass pan lid if you have one rather than having to buy a new one. I also purchased the Lodge silicone handle, at only five bucks - it makes dealing with these hot handles much easier and at that price, I highly recommend it.  Finally, you have to love that this is a 100 + year old legendary American made and owned brand. The fact that you can buy this at the same price as some no-name Chinese pan is a huge bonus, and you really have no excuse not to buy the Lodge.  Enjoy!"
"I'll start by saying I absolutely hate the pre-seasoning Lodge uses on all their stuff, it sticks and is generally just not great. HOWEVER the iron is great quality it just takes a little TLC to get it to the point that it's truly non stick. What I did for starters is I used yellow cap easy off oven cleaner with lye and coated the skillet thoroughly and sealed it in a trash bag, then after about two days pull it out and wash all that seasoning off down to the bare iron(May take two passes to get it all off) Then I took my sanding mouse and smoothed out the iron inside the skillet, once it was nice and smooth to the touch I gave it a nice wash with soap and a sponge. And after all that I began the seasoning process, I use flax seed oil for the initial seasoning then grape seed oil for maintaining it. I seasoned it three times and after that the beast was non stick and I could slide an egg around in it. I have to give credit to the idea of sanding it to Kent Rollins on youtube, I suggest any beginner to go check him out he has some great videos about cast iron. Anyways all in all I'm really pleased with this skillet and would definitely recommend it."
"This was my very first cast iron and I am inloveeee!! GREAT quality, sturdy, great with heat and I mean the cast iron speaks for itself. Season upon receiving (not required, it comes pre-seasoned) and just take basic care and this bad boy will last hopefully more than 3 generations for my family lol. Properly dry, DON’T USE SOAP BESIDES 1ST USE, and enjoy. I personally use crisco shortening to season my pan….once again not a requirement. you can just use it to cook fatty foods and it will become more seasoned overtime. If you are a newbie like how i was to save you a google trip seasoned=nonstick basically. this cast iron will get to the point of just sliding and surfing no stick! heats up very fast! Also another beginner tip…..DON’T OVER OIL YOUR PAN….I REPEAT DO NOT OVER OIL…you will cause it it to become sticky. make sure to always wipe off with lint free cloth and if ya don’t have one a paper towel will work just fine although not suggested. One last newbie tip, oven or stovetop works equally fine to help coat the season…youtube was my bestfriend just check out multiple diff vids. happy cooking!!!! i plan on purchasing the grill cast iron skillet next!"
"11/2016 Bought three of these and all of them are working very well! I seasoned each of them 5 times total with olive oil, 500 degrees for an hour. each time letting them cool down in the stove overnight. Very easy to clean up with a lodge scrapper. They are now nonstick to my satisfaction and i look forward to cooking many meals in these well made skillets. Except eggs. Cannot cook eggs yet :-( They stick like crazy glue...  Update: 2/2017  Finally got the skillets to the point where I can cook eggs and French toast! I re seasoned the skillets with left over bacon fat. Light coat and an hour in oven at 425. Throw a small amount in before cooking and bam, non stick! I cooked the eggs and French toast at setting 3 or 3.5 on my electric stove top. Works great!"
"When I realized that I had purchased this 8 years ago, I figured it deserved a review. This skillet has been used almost daily in those 8 years, has weathered being moved between 3 states, and is still as good as the day I bought it.  Some notes: 1. Do take the time to look into proper care for cast iron. Mine is well seasoned at this point, so it really only requires minimal cleaning. 2. Don't soak things or leave it wet (it'll rust) 3. If you have a stuck-on mess (should happen less and less over the years), use a little soap. But make sure you take the time to re-season it a bit afterward. I like to rub it down with a little oil and heat it up on my range. 4. I've put this through my oven's self-cleaning cycle twice (followed up by a nice re-seasoning). It literally returned the skillet to brand new!  This is a great skillet, and I now own it in a few sizes. Take care of it, and you'll have it for years!"
"I grew up in a very blue box Mac n cheese household and regarded cast iron as somewhat mystical for a long time. “You’ll ruin the seasoning,” etc.  As years wore on I got to be a better cook and eventually took on cast iron cookware. And now I realize I was late to the party!  First of all, this pan is huge. You can’t lift it with one hand and two takes some effort. In fact, everyone makes fun of me and my “giant cast iron pan”, but I use it for everything and it’s roomy enough to spread things out. Heck I even make 3 pancakes at once in it.  Turns out cast iron is the original non-stick cookware and caring for it is as easy as 1-2-3:  1. While hot, wash after you’ve plated your meal. Just use hot water and a nylon scrub brush, no need to use soap, the whole operation takes ten seconds.  2. Dry it off right away with a towel.  3. Pour in a little oil and smear it around with a paper towel. Park it on the stove for next time. You are done!"
"When you need a BIG cast iron pan, this is it. This falls in the be careful what you wish for category, like 12” chef knives. It’s heavy, and big, so washing it by hand in the sink you need to take care not to dent the steel or chip the countertop. It’s not going to play nice in a jumble of other pots and pans in that hard to reach occasional use cabinet. But it does what only a cast iron pan can do. Also makes a passable cat bed."
"Well I bought this five years ago and figured it’s probably time to write a review. Up until last year it was my only pan. I cooked fish, pizza, sauces, meats, eggs etc. About a year ago it started having sticking issues. I fought with it on and off trying to get it to reseason. I finally fixed it yesterday and had scrambled eggs sliding around better than a nonstick pan  Issues: smoking is a problem, it heats up real hot and the oils you add start smoking. Sucks if you don’t have great ventilation which is us. So I had a lot of trouble getting a reseason as I cant use the oven to do it without filling the house with burnt oil smell. There doesn’t seem like to be a way around this unless you have a grill or good ventilation  I used my charcoal grill fired up to 500f for three hours after scouring the pan and put on thin layers of flax oil every 45 mins. This morning it was better than our non stick pan which is definitely seeing its end of days after one year of use. So after five years it’s like brand new which is exciting. That’s something you just can’t do with other pans. I ha e no doubt it’ll last my lifetime as long as I don’t temperature shock it."
"These things are easier to clean than aluminum pots with garbage burned on.  This isn't rocket science. Don't overthink it. Youtubers already laid out easy instructions. Just re-grease it top and bottom after use and heat it up on the stove to set in. Don't leave it moist. I can't believe how many people are ranting like millenials rust rust rust 1 star review.  If it's that hard just go watch a Gen Z review and learn from them. They smarter than a millenial.  My first use I tossed in left overs with shredded cheese on top. Yeah it was caked on. I don't have a Lodge Scraper yet, so I used copper scrub pads and lightly got it off really easily in 5 minutes under hot water. Just the water. Dry it down good. Grease it up i used a dash of olive oil, people said they use crisco. Polish it up, heat it on the stove. Call it a day. People 100 years ago didn't need ""LIFE HACK"" video for common sense. Feels wonderful to use, keep the heat low.  If it's that hard to understand probably better to return this FINE Cast Iron Skillet for something more appropriate for Millenials like Nintendo Amibos or My Little Ponies. GG."
"This pan is great, I think its a nice size and you can cook a lot of things with it, its really good for induction tops, but if you got a glass top I recommend parchment paper to go underneath it to prevent scratching. Great for searing meats and things.  I think many of the reviews that involve rusting and what not are because people did not take care of their cast iron properly.  Rule of thumb: You shouldn't wash your cast iron with soap and water, just give it a nice rinse and scrub it with a hard side of a sponge, immediately dry it, and slather some oil around it to preserve the seasoning. If you just take care of your cast iron, it will do you a great benefit.  Cast Iron is really good for you in general, as you can cook using high heat and it won't release chemical fumes unlike using a teflon coated pan. You can also use metal utensils on cast iron when cooking, I would limit the use, but again no teflon chemical poisoning. It also cooks very evenly and distributes heat nicely, while aluminum pans may also do this, there is a lot going around about aluminum leaching into food while cooking, you should stick to anodize aluminum instead.  Just do your research before you buy the cast iron, it's wonderful, and even better if you use induction cooktops."
"This is an amazing deal especially if your willing to put some elbow grease in. The pan comes pre-seasoned, but I wanted my pan smooth as glass. I ordered 240 grit sandpaper on Amazon for $3. I left my pan on the counter and I would sand the bottom of the pan 10min here.....5min there. I just did it little by little when I had time. After 3 days of doing this off and on my pan is as smooth as glass. It's literally a night and day difference with minimum work. I didn't sand the whole pan just the bottom. Now I will re-season it and it will be as non-stick as teflon, but without the danger. 240 grit sandpaper is extra fine and will remove those big pours and lumps on your pan. Also you cant go wrong with LODGE....its real cast iron made in America."
"This is my first cast iron skillet and I was worried about it rusting. But after some research online I'm slowly getting a better understanding on how to use and care for this type of pan. When it first arrive, I lightly cleaned the pan to wash away any residue from shipping (the box was very beaten up when it arrived). The first thing I cooked was a fried egg and it did stick a little to the pan. The key is to wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil and then the egg. Depending on your stove type you'll need to figure out the strength of your fire (if a gas stove) or the heat on an electric stove. The advice I found online said the skillet hasn't developed it's non stick surface yet. So I made a few more fried eggs later in the week and it started to improve. Each time I used the pan, I cleaned it right away with hot water and very minimal dish soap. Then I placed the pan on the stove to dry off. If the surface looked dull, I added a coating of oil. A week later I cooked some bacon and that helped season the pan a bit more. Today I made some fried chicken and after cleaning the pan of excess oil, my skillet is looking to be taking on a good surface. It's not greasy or sticky. I know eventually I'll get to sauté some vegetables, pan fry tofu, or make a few pieces of french toast without them sticking to the bottom."
"We had forgotten the unsurpassed properties of cast-iron cookware. As most people, we opted exclusively for Teflon, granite, or ceramic coated pans and pots: Not to mislead, we still use them.  However, if your looking for high temperature searing and straight into a 450 degree oven, cast iron is the only choice.  How we rediscovered cast iron cookware: We bought some 2"" bone-in pork chops at Costco. But how to cook without drying them out?  We Googled ""How to cook thick pork chops"" and came across several recipes. The main thing they all had in common was the use of cast iron.  Basically, you pre-heat your oven to 425-450 degrees. Meanwhile. put your cast iron skillet on a stove-top burner set on high. Season your olive oil coated chops with Kosher salt (sea salt) and coarse ground pepper. Once the cast iron skillet begins to smoke, sear your chops on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).  Immediately transfer the skillet (with chops) into you pre-heated oven. For 2"" chops we bake 5 minutes per side.  That's all there is to it. Moist and delicious. Since then, we have followed the same process to lamb chops and fish...adjusting time in the oven.  PS: If you make spaghetti sauce from scratch, use a cast iron pot. Why? You end up with a delicious iron enriched sauce."
"My wife has been using this skillet about 3 times a week since she got it. It came oiled & ready to use. She made some stove-top chicken with what they call smashed potatoes which was fantastic. Looked just as fantastic as it taste. I am amazed at all the recipes that are out there online. I think she got this one from Facebook but I assume Amazon probably has recipes somewhere on the site also for free. If I would have known she'd be getting one of these skillets, I would have went garage sailing more this summer since they're usually a buck or 2. I can tell you from a husbands point of view who's not the cooker in the family, guy's, if you are looking for a gift for your wife, get one. You won't be sorry. For you ladies reading this, it's great. You'll be amazed with what you can cook with it & the recipes out there are nothing short of fantastic. I'll post another review with a photo this week I had to fix the errors on this review because I was calling it a pan & not a skillet. I just ordered her a 12 inch skillet with 8 egg/pancake rings I might as well get those accessories since she'll be doing Sunday morning breakfasts again. The egg rings do help you make the eggs all uniform. With our 18 inch X 12 inch electric skillet, she'll be able to cook 8 eggs at a time, which helps out, plus it helps you make a restaurant style egg, without any broken yokes or egg runs where it looks like one gigantic egg, at least when I am elected to cook that's what usually happens. As for using the Egg Rings for Pancakes, our favorite server at our neighborhood restaurant told us that if we can't get the Real Restaurant Pancake Mix, use Sprite or 7-Up in the place of water, when we make our Pancake Mix. Not only will they have a sweet taste but they'll be nice and fluffy too. One more thing, if you like to cook outside on a grill over a log fire out on the pit, there's nothing around that beats a cast iron skillet. Those Teflon coated skillets warp so easy, they can get ruined after just one meal made outdoors & you now how good food taste's when you cook over an open fire.....Dan"
"After using very expensive hard-anodized skillets for years (so that I didn't have to use butter or oil), they started to fail. When I went to get a replacement because they were guaranteed for 10 years, or life depending on who I asked, I was asked if I had been using oil and subsequently told that even though they were hard-anodized and didn't require oil, I should have been doing so. For health/ nutrition reasons, I had started to use ghee about two years ago so I did some more research and decided to throw away the hard-anodized (since it didn't stand up to what it says it does) and try cast iron.  This is the second Lodge skillet I've purchased. With the first, I didn't know what I was doing and I struggled. Food stuck and clean up was a nightmare. Since I no longer had the hard-anodized to fall back on, I decided to really try with the new cast iron skillet (this one) by following recommendations I read on several websites for seasoning and cleaning (including buying a stainless steel enmeshed silicone sponge, scrapers and a scrub brush).  Now, everything is great!! Food no longer sticks (although some things do still leave a little residue, e.g., scrambled eggs and salmon) and clean up is a breeze. I seasoned both skillets (bought the cast iron oil, which is really just flax seed oil I think, and put them through 5 seasoning cycles) and try to use both regularly. I clean them by rinsing with warm water immediately after cooking using the stainless steel sponge or brush; initially I was afraid the food would get cold, but the skillets clean in no time. Then I dry them well and put them back onto the stove top or in the oven to let the residual heat dry off any remaining moisture (I've read that rust can be a problem).  The skillets do get hot and they hold the heat really well, so I've had to learn to cook a little differently, but nothing has burned, yet anyway. I do use a little ghee every time and try to make sure that I get it into and up on the edges as it melts. The red silicone handle that comes with the skillet is great at protecting my hand from the heat although I am careful to have another potholder nearby.  When transferring the skillets to the sink to clean, this skillet is easily managed with one hand, but the original one I bought, which is larger, can wobble a bit due to its weight so two hands are needed.  I know this is long, but I was so afraid of cast iron before really learning about it and wanted to share my experience to help anyone else thinking the same.  I'm so glad I made the switch. From what I've read, it should get easier and easier to use as time goes by. It's my belief that's it's a healthier way to cook as well... and the browning on things like breakfast sausages is amazingly delicious!!!"
"I'm giving this a five-star review because it is an excellent pan. Unfortunately, I already own this pan. Whoops! We got one this size for our wedding. I really thought that eight inches was bigger than this, lol.  So, I'm posting this review so y'all can see the frying pan WITH my hand in the pic as reference so you can actually tell how big it is (spoiler alert - not very!) It does fit four eggs or four fat sausages, in case you're wondering, but I wouldn't put a fifth one in.  Anyway, don't make the same mistake I did - order the right size!"
"This was my first cast iron pan. I had heard about them and their brilliant heat retaining properties. When I got it I read a few guides on how to use it. You always need just a bit more oil and time, as you have to transfer more heat into this pan to get started. Once you've done it, you have a brilliant cooking vessel for making tender vegetables, excellently browned meats, pizzas and even full pies. Just use the pan itself as the serving dish!  There are lots of dishes I like in this but here are some highlights: * Pork Tenderloin (shown, with BBQ seasoning) * Steaks * Fajitas * Pancakes * Apple Pies * Breakfast Hash * Bacon (back or streaky) * Sausages ... anything really.  If you look at the history behind cast iron pans, people have been using them for years, for basically everything.  You do have to care for your pan. Learn how to season it, learn what not to cook in it (high sugar items can be troubling) and learn how to clean and store it. On that last one, I heat it up to get it very dry, then rub it with a bit of coconut oil and let it cook into the iron. Before it all burns off, turn off the heat and just leave it. That will keep your seasoning happy.  I can see this being passed on to my kids one day  Pros: * Excellent heat retention * Brilliant browning on Meat and Veg * Virtually impossible to hurt it * It's fun to learn how to use it well  Cons: * None  Notes: * Requires reseasoning every so often  I bought this with my own money"
"What is this thing that I bought?!? I followed the instructions from Lodge that came with the skillet (wash with soap and water, then season with oil) against my better judgment because I never use soap and water on cast iron. I have just thrown out a third scrub sponge and wasted another 20 minutes of my life trying to scrub the remains of an omelet out of this thing. Why is the surface pebbly? Why does Lodge say to wash with soap and water and a scrubber? I have two 25-year-old 10"" Lodge skillets, smooth as glass, that I clean with a paper towel dampened with hot water and one cheap smooth-as-glass 6"" cast iron skillet from Taiwan that I clean the same way. What is this pebbly-surfaced, omelet-hugging, scrub-sponge-needing, whatever-seasoning-was-on-there-is-now-long-gone thing that I bought?!?"
"I just tested out my new Lodge 6.5” cast iron frying pan.  I bought this little frying pan because I want to use it for a camping trip I’m planning. I I have experimented with my camping menu and have discovered that although freeze dried foods like Mountain House, Alpine Aire, etc., are good for many things, the problem is with eggs. Freeze dried eggs simply don’t cut it. That’s why I bought this little cast iron frying pan, because eggs need to be cooked on the spot. As I will only need to prepare single servings for myself, this 6.5” size seemed to be the answer.  So, I started by seasoning my new pan. Martha Stewart recommends using Crisco shortening to season the pan. She says that a vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature works best, so, trusting Martha, that’s what I used. Here’s how I did it. 1) I thoroughly washed the new pan with hot water and dish washing detergent. 2) Dried the pan thoroughly by wiping it off and then by placing it for several minutes in a preheated oven at 200°. 3) Coated the pan thoroughly with Crisco (including the handle). 4) Placed the pan upside down on the middle oven rack and heated it to 450° for one hour. 5) Allowed the pan to cool down for one and a half hours.  Now to cook an experimental breakfast! I have read reviews that eggs will stick! (Extra cleaning chores are inconvenient on a camping trip)  I decided to begin with two slices of Spam. The 6.5” pan size will hold exactly two slices of Spam……...so far, so good. And it cooked them just fine in a little margarine. Now for the eggs. I was curious to find out if the 6.5” size would handle 3 eggs; scrambled. A little more margarine into the pan, then pour them (pre-mixed up) into the pan. This little pan EASILY handles 3 eggs! And as I scrambled them in the pan I could see that the pan seasoning was doing it’s job very well. NO sticking! Excellent! Clean up was a breeze. Don’t wash cast iron in water! Just wipe it out and then re-oil it with a bit more Crisco.  Bottomline; mission accomplished! This little cast iron skillet works perfectly for my intended purpose. To cook up a quick breakfast of a couple slices of Spam and 3 scrambled eggs. And then to clean up without effort..........very happy!"
"I love this thing! I'm a recent convert to cast iron cooking. As everyone said if you don't over clean it and just cook crap off it before you use it they work well and non-stick. I'm really impressed with how much better the food tastes. Shocked really. All my cooking is now cast iron. Somebody needs to make a cast iron Foreman style grill! I'll buy that in a second.  Anyway, weighs a ton like it should. Cooks great. The rubber pad thing is helpful but collects grease inside so wash that out a lot. Don't wash the pan a lot though. Just heat and spatula scraping and it is more non-stick than the non stick pans they sell."
"My first iron skillet, and I regret not buying one SOONER! I've realized Teflon pans is a product of good marketing. Why? Certain things are better cooked in high heat such as Meats, steak, sausages, breakfast meats to get the charred marks and High heat COOKS MUCH FASTER. High heat destroys Teflon pans but most cooking I usually use high heat. So, that's why people tend to destroy Teflon Pans, but here's the marketing... Teflon cleans easier. That's the biggest bunch of baloney, just so people will think they can clean faster. But guess what? Meats cook FASTER in iron skillet. So while you SAVE time washing none stick pans, you SAVE a lot of time cooking meats in an iron skillet. And by cooking in High Heat, people destroy Teflon pans that they have to replace $$$ over and over and over again. That said, Teflon has it's benefits. I would use anything that can be cooked in medium heat on Teflon pans.  In conclusion, I would use Teflon for things like eggs, omelettes, cheese, where you only need medium heat to cook.  I am now ONLY going to use Iron Skillet pans for any kind of meat cooking, stews, stir fry, that requires High heat cooking, and I will NEVER have to replace another Teflon pan again."
"BACK STORY: For many hikers, who enjoy cooking in the outdoors there is a general pain with the stainless steel mess kits, I went through the same. It's almost impossible not to burn the pan as it doesn't distribute heat well enough. There is a trick you can do with oil to prep them that works well, but it of course takes more time and the underside of the pan will still burn and have to be cleaned. I switched to the anodized, which works better in comparison with no prep needed. However, the cast iron is a step beyond. It heats just as you would expect and is a great even cook and takes less heat to get results. The only minimal challenges are:  1) you need a pot holder or sleeve for the handle, it gets real hot. 2) you need a pot holder square glove to store it if you plan to hike after, as it will still be hot. 3) the weight, but the 3.5 inch is quite lite and if you have ultra-light gear already, this is not much of an impact.  These three things are fine with me for the cooking results. Thus far, I've test cooked drop-biscuits, eggs, cookies and fish cakes, all with amazing results (see pictures). I'm cooking with isobutane on an MSR pocket rocket. We are becoming fast-friends and I will be eating well on the trail for years to come! I just love it! Thank you Lodge for a great product!"
"I never used a cast iron pan before but I had a couple of recipes I wanted to try that required one. Taking the pan out of the box I wondered if I had made a mistake because it is so different from other types of pans I'm used to. Even though the pan is well seasoned at the factory I followed the directions for seasoning myself and then promptly used it. Wow, It's great. I not only used it to make the baby dutch pancakes and cornbread I got it for but now I'm using for many other things too. If you eat meat there is no better way to cook a steak than to sear it in this pan and finish the cooking in a preheated oven. Cleaning it is easy as the seasoning really makes it a non-stick pan. The handle actually works well with the pan even though it looks too short."
"I bought a cast iron grill press a couple years ago that my husband and I use often. We've thought about getting a skillet as well. After doing a little bit of comparison shopping, I decided on this one from Lodge.  Couldn't wait to try it out as soon as it came. Directions on use and care are clear, with some extra info found on their website online. This one says it comes preseasoned. Still, I was hesitant to get right into it. Husband wasn't though. Our first meal with it tasted delicious. Even cooking. Nothing stuck to the skillet. Clean up was easy enough. And, it's ready to go for the next meal.  We like it so much, we decided to go ahead and get the mini skillet to try a single egg and such."
"Picked up this little 8"" skillet after finally throwing in the towel on non-stick pans altogether. I figured with enough diligent seasoning I could make this my designated omelette pan. Well, imagine my surprise when I rushed things a bit and decided to test-fry an egg after only two coats of seasoning and that sucker slid around like it was on black ice!  I know some people advocate sanding down Lodge's rugged finish, but, I have several pieces and have never found this to be necessary. You want at least a little texture to help that seasoning cling. FWIW, this one didn't have any egregious burrs or pits on the interior surface, so perhaps that had something to do with it, but I must have amazing luck, because 2-4 coats of extra virgin coconut oil seasoning oven-baked on high heat has worked for all five of my pieces (3 skillets & 2 dutch ovens), making them ready for anything. Even eggs and fish!  Oh, and yeah, this thing is perfect for a flawlessly executed 2-egg omelette with some gloriously crispy edges. I couldn't be happier!  Now if only I loved Lodge's Carbon Steel pans as much..."
"This is a great little cast-iron skillet. It heats evenly and quickly, and cleans up beautifully. The food doesn't stick to it at all. I just seasoned it before using it the first time; and then, after each use, season it again with either olive or vegetable oil after washing and drying it. Seasoning, for those who are new to this, is just putting a small amount of oil inside the pan and spreading it around with a paper towel or napkin to give it a light coating...that's it. The cast iron is fine on your Corelle cook top; it does not scratch or damage the cook top; I know because that is the cook top I have. This 6-1/2 inch size is perfect for 1 or 2 eggs, a toasted cheese sandwich, a pork chop, etc., or for cooking and sauteing things to be added to other dishes you may be preparing. I couldn't be happier with this Lodge iron skillet. I bought this small size to give cooking with an iron skillet a try, and now I am sold on them. I plan to buy another in the 10"" or larger size but will only buy the Lodge because it has proven to be great for me. There is a hint of iron taste at first, but that is one of the reasons for an iron skillet - adding iron to your diet. That taste has dissipated with use, though, but you still have that iron added to your food. Price: Amazon always has the best prices. I don't think this is returnable though. You may want to check that if you prefer that option. At the price I paid as an add-on item of a little over $8, I wasn't concerned about that. Happy I bought it."
"I bought the 10.25 inch pan on 5/15/2019 and it’s 11/27 today. I’ve never owned cast iron before, wasn’t too sure it it was worth all the trouble people made it sound like. But I love very crispy breakfast potatoes, and I’ve destroyed non-stick and ceramic pans because of it, and everything just sticks to stainless steel horribly. So I tried this and I’m glad I did. The best trick I can tell you is, start with low heat, and stay there. Just accept it’s going to take a while to cook. I have a gas stove and medium is too high to cook with this thing, food always gets burnt, but medium-low is perfect. And don’t wash it. I use it at least once a week and all I ever do is pour a little more oil in after the food is done, leave it over the hot burner, wipe out the oil and food bits into the trash when it’s cool, wipe with more oil if there’s still food bits left, and store it in the oven so it doesn’t get dusty. That’s it. It’s been great. The only time I use water and soap on it is if it gets gross and sticky (you’ll know when) and don’t scrub it that much, make sure it’s completely dry with paper towels, reheat it with oil, cool and wipe again with oil, and store it with more dry paper towels. Oh and I bought a bunch of stuff with this that I thought I needed to take care of it (cast iron plastic scrappers, chain mail scrubber, silicone gloves) you don’t need any of it. The chain mail was kind of cool but I’ve used it maybe 3 times. And two regular cloth pot holders are enough to touch the handle."
"I ordered this 13.25 inch Lodge skillet when it was on sale, and I'm glad I have it! I have a 12-inch burner on my stove, and this skillet fits just right. The 13.25 inch measure is across the top, and the sides slope inward so the bottom is 12 inches. If you don't have a 12 inch burner, this is not the skillet for you - it will not heat properly on a smaller burner. The first time I used it, there were several spots where my steel spatula snagged against little bumps on the cooking surface. I took some 150 grit emery paper on a sanding block and sanded the bottom of the skillet for about 10 minutes. I ended up with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dust that I washed out, then generously oiled the skillet. The next time I used it, the bottom seemed smoother, but not completely smooth like my old Wagner ware. My spatula no longer snags anywhere. Because of the size and weight of this pan, I leave it on the stovetop most of the time. If I have to move it, I put it on a rack next to the stove, so I don't take a chance of chipping my granite counter with it. I have to lift it with both hands. I use it as a frying pan for breaded chicken and pork chops, as well as a griddle for pancakes, quesadillas, french toast, bacon, fried eggs, and anything else you can think of. I'm looking forward to when we can have a party again, and plan to bake a humongous cornbread in it! Bacon and sausage often leave residue stuck to the bottom, so to clean it I will pour in about a cup of water while it's hot, then take it to the sink while still warm, and run hot water into it and scrub with a brush. I put a dishcloth or dishtowel on the sink divider to protect it from scratches, and rest the skillet on that while washing. No soap is needed most of the time. Just don't leave it until it gets completely cold! Wipe it dry, and use a paper towel to spread a little oil over the cooking surface. Put it on the rack to completely dry. Now I just have to figure out who gets it in my will!"
"This pan was very inexpensive but worth it, I can make my eggs and it will slide right out the pan with no sticking and than you can just wipe the pan clean, the only problem I find is the handle is slightly too heavy so you have to watch to make sure the pan don’t tip over but otherwise I love it."
Seems to be a well made pan. Wide at the bottom like I wanted. Seems to be a good buy for the price unless it falls apart in the near future
"OK, maybe not the entire world, but it is a great little pan. We had purchased a smaller pan of this brand and it performed very well so we went with this slightly smaller companion one as well. Although it is a fairly thick pan, the first one ordered was badly dented, but replaced quickly. Nonstick interior works well enough with or without oil."
I’ve used this every day for eggs or heating chili etc. It still looks new after two months. It seems this will last a very long time!
Like everything. Nice little lightweight skillet. Great for the price.
Not a full sized pan and not small. Nice in-between size. Nice finish. Would purchase again.
Making omelets
I had another product that worked great for everything but did not have a handle. so I brought this product for when I need to flip items. I use the lip from the other pot from this company. It has a hole for steam to escape. I recommend purchasing a cover to go with it.
Nice except that the black paint on rivets is coming off after only two weeks! See the photo. Gross to think that this may be getting into my food. I may return it for a refund - it's a nice pan other than that.
Perfect size
It does everything that is listed above and really couldn't ask for more especially considering the price!
I used it for cooking of course!! 😁
Good price
Low cost and as good as the high priced brands
"Good pan, easy to use and clean, non stick, but it arrived damaged on the right side. The Seller should check if the product has any damage before sending."
"Price was great, and very easy to use! Non-stick works amazing, and perfect for eggs."
Frying pan is great. Totally non stick just the right size.
Great for the price
"I've had this pan a couple months , it's holding up ,well easy to clean . handle gets a little loose are the tightens right up with a screw turn. I would buy this pan again."
this little pan works perfect for me. all my life I've used an iron skillet that is great but now that I cook from a wheelchair I wanted something lighter for small jobs like a couple of eggs. only minor downside is handle is long and slightly too heavy giving pan poor balance when near empty
"Been using this little pan every morning for almost 3 months straight and it is as good shape as day one. I been using it for frying eggs and it truly is nonstick, I only use a small drop of olive oil spread around with paper towel and even that is probably not necessary. Best pan I ever used for frying eggs never sticks. And The Price point is Prefect can't be beat for this price range."
The handle is too heavy for the pan. The pan does not sit flush on my stove unless I prop the handle up. This make it difficult to sauté / cook anything evenly.
"Handle is too heavy for pan I bought 2 and both are the same see picture I posted, I used a saucepan lid handle to level the handle on 8 inch pan I purchased."
Bought this for my college student to take to school. Perfect size for her cooking instead of dining hall meals.
"A little egg frying pan seemed like a great idea; but, the engineering of this pan is off! It is so lightweight that the handle makes it tip over, eggs and all, if you aren’t super careful. Mine also arrived with a dent on the right side. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Lighter than I expected. I would have preferred heavier to hold the heat better. Works well though and since I generally wear out a pan in a year, the price is right for a disposable item."
Well made pan for this price. Really good deal.
Very good product. Great for eggs and grilled sandwiches.
"After only three weeks of use a couple of times a week, everything now sticks. We used no abrasive cleaners or scrubbers, nor did anything that could have caused this. Caveat emptor. You get what you pay for."
"Purchased elsewhere before, needed to constantly tighten handle, this one handle not a problem stays on tight. Easy to clean nice weight, perfect"
"This thing is great to clean, cleans up easily. It’s not very durable and Bens really easy if dropped on the floor."
"I needed to replace my old ones, so glad I found these. Easy to use, easy to clean"
"Very happy light weight, non stick, cleans well. Good price and value."
"Excellent pan, love the small size for eggs, non stick is exactly that!"
This pan met all my expectations. I am very happy with this.
Great egg pan..
Goodvalue
"Extremely good, nothing sticks easy to clean love it"
Works great for small portions
Great pan
Light and easy to use.
"Is it the worlds greatest pan? No, but we ordered this pan to boil water for under our dumping steamer and WOW, it handles that job to perfection."
Excellent
Nice simple pan. Love it.
nice pan
I had one before just needed it replaced.
"Use for pancakes and eggs. Food does not stick to it, it's lightweight. What else do you need?"
so far i like this pan
I dislike you bugging me about this survy
Good value
See title.
very nice product
"I love it. Perfect for eggs, pancakes, small meals. Light, easy to clean, great value for the price!"
"Love this one so much, I ordered another! Just wish they had more of a selction for these pots amd pans! I love everything about this pan!"
Perfect size I used to make egg. Easy to clean to
Handle broke after only a few months. Not really a sturdy pan for long time use.
"One of the selling points is the heavy handle. Well, it's heavy alright. So heavy that it tips the pan so that the bottom doesn't come in contact with the burner, except for the one edge upon which it tips.  Seemed a nice value and the size is right for a single person, but when the heat doesn't touch the pan, results aren't as wanted."
"nice little pan, it arrived scratched though like there were cuts in it with a knife but works great"
This pan is pretty decent for the price it's being offered for. Non-stick works great - only issue was one side was a bit bent inwards so not completely round (as if it fell and got a dent). Nothing too much to worry about. Does what it's supposed to.
Reasonable price with good size
"I read about the handle problem and being very thin. but at $6.00 could i go wrong: YES. The non stick coating stinks at about 250 degree's . My first egg i cook stuck. This pan can bend if you set it down hard. Save your money and buy a better built one, if China make such a item."
"This pan worked great but if it falls off the counter it will bend, the metal used is very soft."
"Cheap, not worth the purchase . It sticks. Do not buy."
Item arrived bent on rim and also doesn't sit flat on the bottom.
Not sturdy
it smells like plaster was burned.
This pan is my one concession to non-stick pans. All my others are either enamel or cast iron. Sometimes I just want the ease of a non-stick. This is my 2nd purchase of this pan. The 1st one lasted many years and I hope this one will as well.
I bought this primarily to use for fried or scrambled eggs--my previous non-stick pans have not given good results. I did have to use a lower heat setting with this pan but the fried eggs turned out perfectly slid out of the pan intact. I did use a very light spritz of cooking spray. Cleanup was a breeze.
I would have given 5 stars however it is a potential danger the pan is so light weight that it actually tips over when cooking it doesn’t quit sit on burner (too small) but I’m not sure if our cook top is off size so I’ll hone 3 not sure of measurements so if possible the next size up would be ideal
I paid a little over $5 for this pan and I was unsure about it when I bought it but after using it the non-stick is amazing it's a little lightweight and the handle tends to try to tip it a little bit when there's no food in there if you're not careful but if you treat it right I think it would be a great pan for cooking quick little meals without sticking eggs slide right off of it
"This is an honest review from a professional chef who has used this product in their home kitchen almost every day for an entire year. I was not paid to write this review nor did I receive any compensation for my efforts.  Initial Observations:  I bought this pan for home use on January 2, 2015. I never use small frying pans, so the 12.5'' was an easy choice. I was initially intrigued that the bottom of the pan was convex and doubted whether the pan would distribute oil/butter evenly for browning/frying. The sides of the pan appeared to be slanted high enough to sautee without the use of a turner/spatula (i.e. using the wrist to move food in the pan). The handle felt comfortable in my hand and the riveting appeared to be sturdy. The overall weight and balance of the pan did not feel awkward.  Use and Abuse:  Despite my hesitation about the convex bottom, the pan browns more evenly than any pan I've ever used. The pan's ability to cook eggs is superior to any pan I've ever used. When multitasking, I can sautee without using utensils. The pan withstands high heat, does not warp and is easy to clean. I do not allow the pan to cool fully before washing it directly under water. I do not use ANY metal utensils in this pan. Minor scratches have accrued. After 1 year, the surface is slightly less non-stick. Use with metal utensils is NOT recommended under any circumstances. It has yet to be determined whether the coating is being removed during cooking or during non-abrasive washings. I sincerely hope it's the latter.  The rivets are not flush with the pan. Food debris collects around the rivets if not cleaned properly. The handle construction has shown no sign of wear. The rivets are fastened securely to the pan. The pan's ability to heat and cool quickly is excellent.  T-Fal Claims that:  1. The unique T-fal Thermo-Spot heat indicator shows when the pan is perfectly preheated for cooking. [TRUE] 2. Prometal Pro nonstick interior is exceptionally durable and scratch resistant. [FALSE] 3. Safe for use with metal utensil. [FALSE] 4. Stainless steel disc for even heat distribution. [TRUE] 5. Anti-warp protection. [TRUE] 6. Dishwasher Safe. {TRUE] 7. Oven safe to 400 degrees F. [TRUE] 8. Safe for all cooking methods including induction. [TRUE]  In my professional opinion, using a metal turner/spatula is not recommended. The two most important claims that T-Fal promotes (i.e. that the surface is durable/scratch resistant and is safe to use with metal utensils) are false. Although I enjoy using this pan at the house, I do not consider this product ""professional"" quality. An alternative coating would eliminate this issue altogether and would not significantly increase production costs: https://www.google.com/patents./US20100276432.  In short, I highly recommend this product for home use only. My 4 star review is extremely generous considering the fact that advanced material science and nano-technology are not being used to create a superior consumer product."
"First of all, I did NOT receive a free one, so this review is not influenced by the desire to keep on getting free stuff.  Second, I purchased the pan almost five years ago, so this is not like all those reviews of ""just received"" products.  Now here's what most of you want to know. How durable is the nonstick surface? Well first keep in mind that ALL nonstick surfaces degrade over time, whether of the Teflon variety or the ceramic kind.  DO NOT be fooled by the ""limited lifetime warranties"" that imply that these retain their nonstick surfaces indefinitely. If you read the fine print, you must return them postpaid to the manufacturer for ""evaluation."" The manufacturers do not tell you that, in the case of less expensive pans like this one, it often costs more to return them on warranty than to buy a brand new one! When I tried to complain about this deceptive practice to the company, they promised me a call back from a supervisor within two business days, but it never happened. So customer service is sketchy.  On the other hand, this pan was reasonably nonstick for over four years, which is far better than most, including all of those beautiful ceramic pans. So you are unlikely to get any better durability than this no matter how much you spend, and this T-fal is relatively inexpensive.  I would have given 4.5 to 5 stars were it not for the deceptive warranty and poor customer service."
"Very disappointed. I bought this for my spouse to use on our induction cook-top range. The pan performed well for 10 months, and then she noticed that the surface was flaking near the center heat indicator. We have all plastic cooking utensils, and this pan was babied.  ""No problem!"" I told her, this pan has a warranty. However, the warranty phone number leads to automated responses, and no return authorization. The instructions to return are to ship at your own cost, and then hope for the best. If you go to ""warranty review"" websites for the manufacturer, you'll read horror stories about many people that paid for shipping and never heard back. Why throw good money after bad? Paying 50% of the cost to ship something in hope that it will ever get a repair (or even a response) is a terrible deal. By design, no doubt."
I have bought this pan for about 5 years based on a review by America's Test Kitchen. They are now substituting a subpar pan. The earlier pans lasted about a year before the non stick part didn't work as well. That was as reported by ATK. Last years pan didn't seem to last as long but I wrote it off. The pan I just received no longer has the metal handle so you can't put it in the oven. It is MUCH lighter than the pan I am replacing. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PAN. It is a cheap substitute for the former pan and it's performance
"It does NOT last..6 months max. It is NOT flat, that never goes away... Look, ALL pans of this type start off kinda non stick, it is how well do they perform and how long do they last. I used this between Feb 17th it's now Oct 30th , so 255 days total, so that means after about roughly 175 uses it is now useless. At this point that butter almost sticks to the pan . Highest oven temp used was 350F, highest stove temp used was perhaps 450F (peanut oil smoke point).Hand washed only, only used nylon or silicone utensils. If you want to add this to your Amazon subscription where you buy a new one every month then maybe that works for you. I will never waste my hard earned money on this pan again, If you choose to...that's on you. You have been warned...hope this helps."
"I bought this pan about 4 years ago, and surprisingly, it's still working very well. The finish still mostly nonstick, though not as good as brand new. We haven't been babying the pan either, and the quality seems evident compared to another faberware skillet we purchased around the same time. The faberware pan has a bit of flaking all over the rim of the pan, this t-fal does not. And while the central surface of the faberware isn't peeling, it's much more prone to bonding to foods than the tfal.  Overall, it's not perfect, but it's not expensive and has performed better than all my previous pans at higher and lower price points."
"Having kids we're trying to teach to cook, I bought this mainly as a distraction piece so they wouldn't mess with our other cookware. It worked, but it also impressed me tremendously! I still prefer cast iron for much of what we do, but, for me, having this even just for omelettes has been well worth the price. It's just been 2 months, so time will tell, but the non-stick properties are really amazing. I've never had omelettes slide out like on commercials. With the base, it has a nice heft, it's neither heavy nor flimsy and so far it has helped it withstand kids washing the skillet before it's fully cooled down. I haven't tested that it's supposedly ok with metal utensils, and I don't plan to. I also do not use cooking sprays but a little avocado oil and wipe it around before cooking. With any luck, this will preserve the non-stick properties and avoid the eventual burned on build up from cooking sprays that has ruined pieces before for us. It has been mentioned that the center is raised a bit, which is true, but it's how it is designed to be. I've made very thin omelettes on this without issue. I use an infrared thermometer when cooking to see that heat is distributed and monitor the temp. I've found this to heat as expected as compared to my cast iron, which I take to be an indication of shortcomings of my glasstop's burners. I rotated the skillet and it verifies that. The red decal that changes color when ready to cook does work well. It seems to go solid, reliably, right at 300­°. It's only been 2 months, so it will be interesting to see how this holds up, but it does get used at least 5-7 times a week between all of us. Unfortunately for me, I see this listed today at $28, whereas I paid $33. The good news is that even at a higher price this would've been worth it. If my kids kill it somehow after a year or so, I'll likely get another one. With my luck, it won't be made anymore. Highly recommended."
"I bought this pan first around 2013 for the same price and used it mostly as recommended (almost never used metal spatulas/tools with it, no super high heat/at most 7/10 on glass top infrared element and usually lower, didn't put it immediately in cool water while it was hot etc). It held up very well for a non-stick pan, you can see the old pan on the right is a lot darker/somewhat scratched from all the use. Despite the use, the old one still is decently non-stick, I was just ready to replace it because of fears of the Teflon surface material getting into food with the little scratches and all. The new one is insanely non-stick, I forgot how amazing it was for the first few years I bought it, this is a great pan that holds up well for typical home use. It does have the issue where it's not completely flat, oil tends to pool around the edges, but despite this I cook hashbrowns in it all the time and as long as you swish the oil around to coat just before putting them on, it works great! Things cook evenly despite the very slightly raised middle, hashbrowns appear evenly brown when I flip etc. Cooks eggs like a friggin beast! The bottom of the old pan of course just got brown from old oil I didn't clean up from the cooking surface before using it again.  Anyway, to summarize I do recommend this pan, just make sure at a minimum not to use any metal tools with it and don't scrub with anything more than a soft sponge if you want it to last a long time!"
"This is my favorite non-stick pan! I have a small one (8"") that is perfect for crepes, but the 10.25"" is perfect for our pancakes, eggs, and just about everything else! We have a gas stove, and I've found if I go much bigger than 10"", items in the pan don't heat evenly. I love that the center changes when the pan reaches temperature, and it really is a true non-stick. This is my 3rd one (including the 8"" that I still use), and I don't think I'll ever buy a different one. Thank you, T-fal! Disclaimer: I am not the best cook, so I have a tendency to throw pancake batter on a still-too-cold pan, and then leave food in the pan a bit longer than they probably should be left (i.e. I burn things occasionally)."
"I bought this skillet in 2014 after a review on America's Test Kitchen, during the show's first incarnation. I bought it from Amazon and have now owned and used it almost daily through this date (3/2020). It has sustained no scratches to the cooking surface. It has remained consistently non stick, easily cleaned and thoroughly the best nonstick skillet we've ever had in our house, regardless of price. It has kept these attributes in spite of occasional, accidental overheating. I keep expecting it to wear out, but it just does not! It is far superior to a similar All-Clad that I owned for 8-10 years and NEVER, even when brand new, was the All-Clad's nonstick feature worth a toot. I paid a ton of money for the All-Clad and a relative pittance for this T-fal. I cannot recommend this skillet too strongly. It is easily one of the best kitchen tool investments I have made."
"I've had a lot of fry pans over the years and this one is one of the best I've had. I bought mine over 7 years ago and only in the last few months has it started to show me that it is time to buy anew, but it appears it is ""Out of Stock"" and every time I come back to check on availability, nothing has changed, yet the price continues to climb.  Have debated on buying smaller pan, but since I have a lid for the 12.5 that is still in good shape, I prefer not to have a lid without a pan or smaller pan without a lid.  The key to long lasting non-stick fry pans is to NOT turn the heat on high. Never higher than medium or just barely above medium will help keep it in good shape. Also, always hand wash and never use metal utensils."
"T-fal Professional Nonstick Fry Pans are superb all-round pans:  SIGNATURE USES:  * sautéed asparagus / bxl sprouts. medium high heat: snap ends / half-or-quarter sprouts, splash of water, cook lid on for 5 mins, then lid off until water evaporates, then add touch oil and flip until lightly browned. The size of the pan fits a whole supermarket bunch of asparagus, which no other fry pan I own does.  * Salmon for the family. medium high heat: a 6 inch piece of salmon fillet, touch of oil in pan. start flesh side down, 3 mins until lightly seared, then flip using spatula and tilting pan (low sides good) onto skin. leave on medium heat until cooked through. ~ 7 minutes ?. skin should be crackly, center of salmon moist.  GOOD:  * not terribly expensive  * All non-stick wears down, and thus non-stick pans are inherently consumables. This lasts longer than I recall when I last replaced it.  * The shape of the sides is pefect for flipping, and makes reaching food with spatulas very easy.  * induction compatibility is high. The pan heats quickly and evenly.  * standard size fits my existing lids from all-clad / calphalon just fine.  NOT GREAT:  * Non-Stick durability is NOT best-in-class. But I find the price/permance tradeoff IS best-in-class. I would need to double the cost to improve durability, but instead I buy this and a slightly smaller t-fal for the same price.  * heating disk is superb. For a disk. Cooking performance at the edges (outside the disk) is clearly not up to tri-ply pans. But see previous point."
"Excellent nonstick pan by T-fal company. This is my go-to frying pan for omelets, pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, browning potstickers, sautéed vegetable and fish filet. I have had the same pan for many years and I only need to replace one after 2 or 3 years of using almost everyday. I only use plastic or silicon turners & tongs to cook. I noticed overheating without any food on the pan is the most damaging the nonstick coating. If you take good care of the pan, then it will probably last longer. I never put this pan to our bosch dishwasher and it cleans so easily with warm soapy water and soft sponge. Hardly anything stick to the pan if you keep the surface not damaged by metal utensils. I highly recommend to this pan over any other brand for everyday use. I believe America Test Kitchen has tested this particular pan and reviewed a multiple times that it's the best one available for consumers."
"Once I correctly seasoned this pan using the instructions (with olive oil and mild heat), and followed the directions to only use medium heat, this pan has been a wonder. No matter what I cook, I can clean it with a soft sponge and the non-stick surface has remained perfect and ideal. I had had in the past the T-fal sauté pan with glass top, and didn't follow directions and used too high heat and too abrasive a cleaner and rubbed off the coating at spots ruining the coating. The nice thing is that the former glass top actually works with this new pan, even though it doesn't make a hard seal it still fits. Just take care in cleaning and use...I'll never buy another brand of pan again."
"I first purchased one for my son. I kept going back to it in my decision process. Not as heavy as hard anodized. There was something about the combined; medium weight, durability and comfort grip handle, I just couldn’t resist. So, gave it as a gift and he’s been pleased.  I was needing a larger skillet, this heats up well, washes up easily and holds up to cooking demands. There’s what I’ll call a heating element, on the bottom (outside) of pan, believe it’s aluminum that really sold me. If they have it in the images look closely at them, see for yourself.  I made BBQ chicken, for sandwiches yesterday, the inside of pan was coated with cooked on BBQ sauce. I did soak the pan in water and a drop of liquid dish soap for a few hours. Was completely delighted when I washed it with my soapy sponge at how easily and quickly it was clean. Was expecting to give it some time, it really took less than 5 minutes. I’ve been very happy with this purchase."
"I have a larger version of this that worked well as a general go-to nonstick pan (I don't use nonstick all that often - mostly for eggs...). After a while, all nonstick pans need to be replaced - it's just the nature of the beast. I grabbed this without paying enough attention, not expecting it to be the small size it is. I opened the box and laughed at myself for my mistake, but figured I would try it rather than pay to send it back.  Well, I'm glad I tried it - this little pan is *perfect* for whipping up breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled or 2 over easy fit perfectly inside; and its easy to whip out a perfect omelette with no effort. The size and sloped sides make this my new go-to nonstick pan (especially seeing as eggs are what the other 12"" was used for most of the time!) - you can knock out a breakfast for 1 or 2 in a matter of minutes. And as with all of the pans in this collection, they really are a good nonstick surface - things will slide right off. I'm tempted to pick up a spare or two for when this inevitably needs to be replaced in the future..."
"Let me start by being not so kind about another product. There’s this other brand that advertises being so slick you could slide into Kim Kardashian’s DMs successfully without Kanye noticing. However, after the first use, it was scratchier than my dad’s wool blanket from Yellowstone Park circa 1959. What I’m saying is: I had been burned in the past - which led to many burned pancakes (and subsequently letdown 4 and 7 year olds).  Fast forward past 4 weekends of inconsolable rage. I took fate in my own hands. Or... Googled the best non-stick cookware.  #1 was a $90 competitor to this one at #2 for a reasonable price.  And it was worth it. When I say worth it - I mean VIP at Disney worth it... not splurge on the good seats on Spirit Airlines worth it. Best $25ish I’ve ever spent.  Pancakes slide off this thing like a freshly polished Publix floor. Eggs are less likely to stick to this pan than I am to stick to watching reruns of “This is Us” with my wife. Cleaning is easier than passing third grade in a North Carolina public school.  I will advise: go through the “seasoning” process of adding oil / wiping it clean after the first several uses. Sounds absurd and inappropriate, but it makes a difference.  I would recommend this to everyone I know... and everyone I don’t - which is 99.999999999999% of Amazon memberships."
"I came here to buy another one and thought to leave a review. After reading many reviews, I decided to check my pan(s).  I bought this pan after being disappointed with many others, such as the ceramic non-stick coating which is NOT non-stick, its ""semi-stick"". We have had the exact older version of this pan for many years and finally its time to replace it due to the coating being scratched and coming loose. We always liked this T-Fal Pan, right alongside two other high end Pampered Chef 8"" skillets.  Here's what I found:  -The older pan weighs only 13oz, while this newer pan is 18.5oz. Part of this may be the rubberized handle which the old pan doesn't have. The newer pan ordered only 5 weeks from this review, actually has a nicer feel to it. -The older pan is not magnetic. The new pan is. -The old AND the new pan both have the exact ""crown"" or convex ""belly"" in the center. Exactly the same measured by holding a straight edge on the bottom of the pan. They are identical in this way. I have fixed cheap pans in the past using a rubber mallet on a solid work bench. I have read chefs who say dont waste your money on expensive non-stick, consider them disposable and just replace them, so we just buy Walmart pans usually, but I didn't like ANY of the 8"" pans due to high sides that Walmart sells, so I bought this one after buying one of those ceramic pieces of junk online...that will go to Goodwill, but I'm not even sure I should pass along such a terrible cooking surface. A solid hit from a skilled hand with a rubber hammer flattens out any of these cheaper pans in my experience. I may try that with this T-Fal, it doesn't normally bother me with the middle being high, but it might now that the reviews here brought my attention to it! I can probably smack that right out. I usually have to flatten the reverse direction, so it will be interesting...maybe I'll try the old one I'm about to throw out first! -The old pan says made in France, I could not find a country of origin stamped on the new pan  Bottom line for me; we always liked the old T-Fal pan we've had for at least a decade I would say, but I like this newer one even better, it just feels nicer in the hand and its actually heavier than the old...in my house with the pans I'm comparing, which are essentially the same design...I think the newer is improved design."
"One of my favorite cooking shows does product reviews, and when they come to non-stick cookware one of the things they point out is that non-stick surfaces don't stay that way indefinitely. (We can all attest to that.) So, their advice is don't buy the pricey non-stick fry pans, look for quality at a lower price-point. T-Fal is just such a bargain. Their products are reasonably priced, they have a decent non-stick coating, and they feel and look sturdy. All in all, they're a worthwhile purchase. This particular T-Fal 10.5 inch fry pan is, for the modest price, quite a remarkable item. It has good weight and even heat distribution. It also looks far more expensive than it really is. When it wears out I'll replace it with another, but in the meantime, it's going to be my go-to non-stick pan. If I treat it well, I'm sure I won't be disappointed. That makes me a fan. I highly recommend this brand."
"When I say this is our 3rd T-fal pan that may not sound like a rave (why is it wearing out?) but we love this! As a couple expert reviews pointed out this will not be a forever pan. After 5 years of near-daily use our last one was ready for retirement. It was never chipping and was still mostly non-stick at 5 years old but it also had warped and was just not the star it used to be. But that was after 5 years of heavy use. How can I complain?  The final straw for the last pan was when I forgot it was on the stove and a sauce burned until the pan was dry. This took a toll on the finish - but again, that is my missuse and comes after 5 years of heavy use!!  There is the heat spot which tells when the pan is heated. Seems to work really well but by year 5 if won't be quite so sensitive. But who cares! My year 5 you know your pan really well.  We just came off having one of the Green Pans. It was no competition. The T-fal is not the temperamental, high-maintenance product as Green Pans- food just slides right out and the pan is incredibly easy to use. Get one if you need one."
"I bought this a few months ago to replace a pan that had numerous scratches from misuse. This is better than I expected for the price. It is just the right size for cooking for two people. I use this with a universal lid when covering the food is required. Very happy. My other pan was scratched from stacking fry pans in my cabinet. I have resolved that. This pan has not been scratched because I am caring for it now. I am also using the proper cooking utensils, primarily heat-resistant silicone."
My first experience cooking with this pan was like a dream. One of the most pleasant cooking experiences I have ever had  Everything glides around the pan like Peter Pan  I got this for my parents because they mostly use nonstick when cooking. I know non stick pans like this are known to not last for very long. I got this one to replace some nonstick skillets they’ve had for 6+ years I assume.  I will soon be getting some carbon steel skillets for myself
"I needed a new pan, specifically just for cooking eggs. This pan takes that job and others with ease. The negative comments seem like they could have been easily avoided by reading the care and use sheet. Also, don't use metal utensils on these style pans. Ever. It's going to ruin the pan quick. Don't scrub with the adhesive side of a sponge. This pan is not ""professional"" in the sense you'll find it in the back of a restaurant, that's marketing and advertising. But it is an excellent choice for the home chef."
"I bought the 8"" in 2012, the 12.5"" in 2013 and the 10.5"" in 2016. I don't use them every day but they work great. No chipping (I never use metal utensils). They do have a convex bottom but it doesn't bother me that my eggs are not perfectly round. I've never put them in the oven even tho they are supposed to be heat resistant up to 350F-400F. For the price it was a good buy. I have noticed a lot of price increases on everything I buy and much of it is blamed on the COVID Pandemic. It's just a good excuse to raise prices and not look like they are gouging the customer."
"Update April 2020: Just ordered a replacement, as the non stick is just beginning to show signs of wear. Don’t bother with the “warranty”. It’s been slightly over two years; always hand washed; 98% of the time no metal tools (except when guests are cooking and they forget). Medium heat max. Still recommend. ——- My wife loves this fry pan! It’s rated #1 by America’s Test Kitchen and this is the size they recommend. Just because it’s non-stick doesn’t mean that you have to forfeit using a little olive oil and butter when you fry. Medium heat or lower. Cleanup is also easy - let it cool, wipe it out and use a little soap and water. No need for using dishwasher space. Yes, it’s not perfectly flat; my wife says it was designed that way. Also, you need the “Paderno World Cuisine Stainless Steel 12 1/2 Inch Lid” also from Amazon. It’s pricey, but worth every penny. UPDATE: this pan sometimes gets used multiple times a day. Still terrific. We make sure that the heat is maximum on medium and the pan is cool before hand washing. Very handy that the bottom is not flat when you get the hang of it. BUY THE LID TOO. Expensive, but you’ll be glad you did."
"If you are a fan of cook's illustrated and ""America's test kitchen"" then you know this is one of their recommended lines for the budget line of non-stick fry pans, and their recommendation does not disappoint one bit. At this price point you cannot beat the quality of this pan. Sure it will only last about a year or two with heavy use, but at this price who cares! We have used this thing for everything, sauces, searing steaks, sauteing vegetables to finishing stuff off in the oven and it does it all very well. So if you are looking for a great non-stick budget pan look no further than the T-fal professional series of pans, you will not be disappointed!"
"I have a favorite pan in every category (cast iron, aluminum, etc.) and this is by far my favorite non-stick pan. Ever. And that's not just counting what's in my kitchen right now, I mean for the market as a whole. It's durable, well constructed, and really does disperse heat with extreme efficiency. The non-stick coating works very well and is remarkably easy to clean.  I've actually owned a few of these pans now. They last me about 3 years, and that's with very heavy use - pretty much every day. And every time I but a new one I'm impressed with the changes they've made over the last version. IMO, these are better than faberware, which is what I hear recommended a lot. If you're like me and like using a variety of cookware types depending on the job, then this is your non-stick pan. If you're looking for just one pan to do pretty much everything, then this is your only pan."
"I have used Tefal pans exclusively for non-stick for many decades. With our new induction range we needed a new induction compatible large non-stick frying pan. Prior aluminum body Tefal pans have always been quite light. This 12.5"" pan has a good weight that should provide better performance. [I deliberately have heavy pots, pans, griddles etc.]  The packaging was interesting. The pan was packed in the factory in a strong double wall carton that is ready for shipping by Amazon. There is no typical glossy packaging. The packaging is very good and this eliminates the a box inside a box with fillers and packaging waste/expense is reduced.  As for frying pan warping, pans should be warmed slowly to avoid the center of the pan having to expand faster than the rims with no place to go. Because induction ranges can deliver heat so fast, the need for care in warming needs to be heeded to care for all stove top cookware. Avoid warming a pan with an element that is too small for the pan."
"I love this pan! I have expensive Circulon and Calphalon pans that aren't as good as this pan. After six months, the cooking surface is as good as new. It cleans up like a dream; a quick whisk with a paper towel removes any cooking residue, and a quick wash with hot, soapy water is all that's needed. The surface has been absolutely non-stick while cooking. The strange thing is that the bottom of the pan is convex, so that the center is the highest point. It was that way when I bought it. I wondered how that would affect the cooking, but it hasn't had much of an effect, even with eggs and pancakes as I cook most foods in a preheated pan. In fact, I think the foods retain less oil because they aren't sitting in it as they cook. I add a little oil, swish it around to coat the pan, and then quickly add the food. No problems. I'm thinking of getting more of these pans in the future as I need to replace my more expensive cookware."
"I purchased this pan on the advice of America’s Test Kitchen and have been impressed with it. I have owned if for about a year so far and it is still going strong, even after I knocked it off the stove and dented the side. I know it says that it is safe to use metal utensils on it, but I don’t and wouldn’t recommend it either. Metal would eventually scratch it, which would lead to chipping. I also use fat every time when cooking in it, and this too will extend the nonstick abilities of the pan. Like others have noted, it does have a slight dome to the center of the pan which takes some getting used to. Like all nonstick items I know that eventually the nonstick qualities will degrade and require replacing. The price of these pans makes that not a huge deal, and I will recommend them to anyone."
"This 10 inch T-Fal skillet arrived in packaging that was sure to keep it secure during the shipping process. It is a well made skillet and seems of sturdier construction that previous T-Fals that I have owned. It sits nicely on my glass top stove. the bottom of the pan is level and flat. Instructions that came with the pan say it is not necessary to season skillets with a nonstick surface, so I did not. I believe the key to keeping this pan in good shape for a long life is to adhere to the instructions: (a) use heat setting no higher than medium heat; and (b) do not use metal utensils. although I primarily use pans that are not nonstick to cook with, this pan will be used for certain foods and I expect it will last me for years to come. Very happy with this amazon purchase."
"UPDATE (May 2017): After a little over 2 years, the non-stick surface finally lost it's non-stick properties. Part of that was due to the fact that my wife loved this pan so much, she used it all the time for everything, and non-stick pans will last longer if you only use them for applications where you really need a non-stick surface. NO non-stick surfaces last forever, however, which is why I think it's silly to spend a fortune on a non-stick pan. Of all the non-stick skillets I've tried (including some of the expensive ones) T-fal has the best non-stick surface.  Some notes, though. This pan did exhibit the ""hump"" in the middle of the cooking surface, but I still say the constant belly-aching over this is way overstated. It never affected the ability to cook anything I wanted to. If anything runs towards the edge, just give it a quick swirl – problem solved. It made great, thin omelets, even with the ""hump, until the non-stick surface wore out.  However, this pan did warp. Just enough that it wouldn't lie perfectly flat on a ceramic cooktop. I think it had something to do with the construction. Although it conducts heat evenly, this is not a heavy duty pan. The stainless steel bottom is a thin disk mated to an aluminum body, which is different than more expensive pans that sandwich an aluminum disk between layers of stainless steel. The two metals expand and contract at different rates, so I think warping is inevitable with this design.  Because of that, I opted for the Ultimate Anodized version of this pan for its replacement, which features solid anodized aluminum construction. Same non-stick surface. Same handle. I've been very happy with it.  If you have an induction cook-top, then this Professional version is your only option. It's a good pan. Just don't overheat it and maybe avoid super hot dishwasher cycles to make it last longer.  (May, 2014) It's still pretty much brand new. So I can't comment on its durability, yet.  The build quality is fine. I prefer a slightly longer handle and ones with the slip-on silicone sleeves, but it's fine. This pan is oven-safe, but only at less than 400 degrees. But this pan is not made for super-hot cooking - no non-stick pans are. It's not a super heavy pan, but it's not super thin like so many cheap ones. But the purpose is to quickly heat things up, and it does so evenly. Mine did not exhibit the ""bow"" that some complain about. Even if it does bow slightly over time and the oil runs to the sides, I'm not concerned. With a non-stick skillet, you are adding fat strictly for flavor. A quick swirl is all that's necessary when you add the food.  (Note: If you actually watch ATK like I do, you would see that their skillet actually DOES exhibit the bow and their oil runs to the sides. Doesn't seem to stop them from making great food, so I think the bellyaching over this is a bit overstated)  If you are adding more than, say, a tablespoon of oil, you probably need to use a different pan, anyway. You should be using this pan to cook quickly sauté veggies or cook delicate foods like fish and eggs, not to cook burgers and steaks or simmer foods for a long time. Use stainless steel or cast iron for those things.  The non-stick surface is excellent. Omelets are a breeze. Fish releases easily and intact while still getting a little color. To make the surface last as long as possible, hand washing is best, and cleanup is easy.  This is more than I've spent on a non-stick skillet in the past - I usually just buy inexpensive commercial non-stick pans from restaurant supply companies. But the America's Test Kitchen tests and reviews seem to suggest that this one will put up with a little more abuse and retain it's excellent non-stick properties longer than most. I can't comment on that yet, but I haven't seen the non-stick properties of any of these skillets last longer than a year - or two, at best. Dings and scratches are normal wear-and-tear, unless you really baby these things, - always hand wash them, always use soft utensils (wood and silicone are best - hard plastic can still scratch the surface), and store them in a way that the non-stick surface never contacts any other surfaces.  This skillet does the types of cooking it was made for extremely well. That's why you should buy it."
"So far, so good. I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the pan before its first use (washing and seasoning). I use the pan on low to medium heat, unless I’m boiling water or reducing liquids. In that case I use medium high to high heat. I only use a wooden spoon or nylon spatula with it. It’s a breeze to clean. Nothing sticks. The handle stays cool, which is nice. I think the reviewers having bad experiences with this awesome pan are probably ignoring the instructions in the little manual that comes with the pan. High heat, not seasoning it before its first use, using metal utensils, and not seasoning after every tenth or so use will cause the issues the naysayers are describing. This is a wonderful pan and a good value, IF you heed T-fal’s directions."
"I decided to replace ALL of the pots and pans I have..... I'm almost 50 and had the hugest collection of old crap that was still functional,,, buuut you just hate the idea of replacing when you could use the money on something else. Well, It was bugging me enough. I bought 2 of these pans, plus two of a bigger set. (we use pans a lot). OMG, these are awesome. Very tough, and work great. They're heavier and take a few extra seconds more to heat up but they also don't bow out in the middle and turn into distorted woks. In all I think I spent maybe $110, I had 4 pans this size, two medium and two smaller, then also the 8 pots (2 of each size) all with very nice lids. I've even resorted to being super lazy and just throwing everything in the dishwasher,,, why? Because I can and it's awesome. They clean up great and the nonstick has been holding up to tons of punishment. As a matter of fact, I stopped using our eclectic griddle which is also brand new butt the nonstick in these pans is a thousand times better."
"My go-to skillet -- nothing sticks and it washes up so easily! Love this larger size too! Mine has seen heavy use in last year and still looks nice.  UPDATE April 9, 2019: I originally purchased this on March 29, 2014 and am only now needing to replace it. This was used for 5 years, used nearly daily and is my favourite large skillet ever! I am including a picture of my old skillet after 5 years of heavy-duty usage. I think it lasted an incredibly long time -- the finish can really take a beating. I did use non-metal spatulas which I'm sure added to its longevity. My old one has now reached the end of life -- foods had finally started to stick. Just received my new one today -- here's hoping for 5 more great years!!! Buy this skillet with no reservations. (Added bonus: it costs $10 less than my original purchase 5 years ago)  In response to those who say it is warped -- completely untrue of mine -- mine was always level and no foods, oils, egg, etc. drifted to the edges. I suspect those encountering this problem may have rinsed it in cold water while it was still hot from the stovetop. If this isn't the case -- then they must have gotten a rare dud skillet. Mine was perfectly level for 5 straight years as is my new replacement one!  ***I like to warn people with parrots to NEVER use this on high heat; always use teflon-type products on either low or low-medium heat and vent well; the fumes ANY non-stick finish product is lethal to parrots.**"
"These are the best pots/pans I have ever used! This particular one I actually purchased as a gift for my mom, but I have completely switched all of my pots and pans to the T-Fal E series. I have yet to cook (or burn) anything that actually stuck to the surface and couldn't just be wiped out. FOR EXAMPLE: I occasionally make sandwiches for my family, and one thing that I do is throw deli meat (whether it's turkey, ham, salami, etc.) in the pan to heat it up and give it a slight crispiness, and top it with cheese (processed, shredded, real cheese, whatever we have at the time). I will then flip it over to ""toast"" the cheese side. Again, the cheese releases from the surface as good as the meat does, and this gives it a little smoky flavor that adds to the overall taste. This is by far the best non-stick pan I have ever used!  PROS: Incredibly non-stick No harmful chemicals in the coating (does NOT contain PTFE (Teflon) Super easy to clean Lightweight, but solid Has a color changing circle in the center to let you know when it's hot Retains a considerable amount of heat (you can cook the same with less heat from the burner)  CONS: Does not hold up to use with metal utensils -- have to use silicone-coated or plastic Made of aluminum -- this contributes to the light weight, but is soft and dents/bends easily if not properly cared for Lids are not readily available (T-Fal does not make them)  After about 2 1/2 years of near daily use, this particular pan became ""sticky"" due to improper care (the non-stick surface became VERY scratched, down to metal in some spots), but this is not a fault of the pan. It could have easily been prevented.  I cook just about every meal for my family, and after using this I would never switch to a different brand or series of pots and pans. But, like any high-quality item, they must be properly cared for. SUGGESTIONS: ALWAYS wash by hand, do NOT put in dishwasher!! (This should be self-explanatory, it takes approximately 30 seconds to completely clean by hand). For me, washing consists of a rinse under hot water, a simple wipe (NO SCRUBBING NEEDED) with either a soapy soft-sponge or cloth, followed by a hot water rinse and towel dry. DONE! NEVER heat pan with nothing in it!! (Even though it is non-stick, you should always add a little oil/butter or whatever you are cooking to the pan while heating). This prevents the pan from overheating. DO NOT overheat!! Overheating the pan causes the coating to ""scorch"" and will greatly reduces it's effectiveness. ALWAYS use plastic or silicone-coated utensils, as metal utensils WILL damage the surface. Pay attention to your cooking temperature! The design of these pans allow you to get a better cook in the same amount of time with less heat on the burner! For example, I can boil water with the burner set at 6 in the same amount of time that it takes an aluminum or stainless pot to boil with the burner on 9 or 10. Frying (say, eggs or burgers) can be done on 4 or 5, whereas other pans need to be on 7 or 8. **YOU'RE SETTINGS MAY DIFFER!! EVERY STOVETOP CAN PRODUCE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEAT!!**  I have used everything from cheap ceramic-coated non-stick to very expensive (and overpriced, if you ask me) PROFESSIONAL stainless steel cookware, and nothing I have used in the past can even begin to compare with the quality of this series of pots and pans by T-Fal. Not to mention, the price on this series is outstanding, and i would easily pay double for them if I had to, and they are definitely worth it!.  I have repeatedly, and continue to recommend these to ANYONE looking for pots/pans or having a problem with sticking food. Now, I am not a professional chef, and I do not consider myself to be, but I do cook with multiple pots/pans a lot, and these have made cooking a much better experience for me, and cleanup is much simpler (no soaking to get the stuck-on crud off!)."
"I cook with this pan at least 3-4 times a week and it works well for frittatas, vegetable sautes, frying fish -- in short, for any food that really needs a non-stick finish. I only use plastic/silicone utensils with this pan but I still find that all non-stick pans have a limited lifetime of approximately 3 years because eventually the non-stick surface gets a little too rough for my purposes. This is my second T-fal saute pan and I expect I will have to replace this one, which is already two years old, with another one at some point. YMMV -- I cook frequently with this pan so it may last longer if you use it less frequently.  We have a Bosch induction cooktop and it works fine with this pan. I often put the pan in the oven to finish frittatas and have never had any issues with doing that. I am not bothered by the slight convex aspect of the pan as it has never affected my cooking. It's not as heavy as some of my other saute pans but they are not non-stick and cost a lot more than this one.  Overall, for the price I think it's a great pan, especially if, like me, you expect to replace it every 2-3 years."
"So: Cooks Illustrated gave this a great review, and my old non-stick skillet (by Cuisinart, a fantastic pan that gave me the better part of a decade of good service) was really needing to be retired, so I went ahead and pulled the trigger. The pan looked great right out of the box, and I couldn't wait to put it through its paces. Unfortunately, the very first thing I made, fried eggs (which need a little bit of fat to cook right) proved that I had one of the pans that were bent... the center bows up higher than the sides, so anything liquid you pour into the pan races off the center and puddles around the edges. I pulled the Cuisinart out of the give-away pile and put it back into rotation, figuring I'd give the bum pan to one of my college kids getting ready to move out.  Then I saw a review here that mentioned T-fal would replace the faulty pans. So I emailed T-fal (t-fal@mailnj.custhelp.com) and was told I needed to pay shipping. After a little nastygram back, they changed their tune and sent a shipping label. I sent it back and within a few weeks, a new pan arrived.  Guess what? Either they sent me back the original pan or just didn't test this one... it had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM! Do these guys not have a research department? Could they not see that the stamp on the bottom was rendering their otherwise wonderful pans unusable? What is wrong with them? Another disappointed email, and to my surprise, they offered to send ANOTHER pan! I held off on the order of the replacement Cuisinart pan, and waited doubtfully for the third pan to arrive.  Turns out, in the case of T-fal, third time's the charm! I got a lovely flat pan, which really does perform as beautifully as the Cooks Illustrated review said it does. So... you have to be your own best advocate, but if you are persistent, you WILL wind up with a pan you love (hence the 5-star review, despite their embarrassing willingness to send out flawed products).  By the way, I wish I'd seen another reviewer's solution months ago: he set the pan on a ring of rolled-up towel, and stepped on it to flatten it. Brilliant! But still... we shouldn't have to dance on our cookware to make them useable.  Five stars for the good pan, four for their customer service, and one for the idjit who thought an un-counter-pressured stamp on the bottom of a flat pan would be a good idea."
"Luv, luv, luv it!!! The look, the feel, everything about this pan screams topnotch... It has a nice weight to it, and the red spot vaguely helps, but it is a nice feature. I have used it four times and the only caveat is that I wish it was deeper or the sides not so low or angled out. One of the BEST NONSTICK COATINGS EVER!! It was almost too slippery. I had to get the hang of it since I was used to a pot that I had for over 17 years, so some of my food kept sliding out when stirring. I can definitely get used to a much nicer and durable pan, so no problems with that. I wound up tasting a little more than normal...lol I tested mine just a little with silverware to see if it would scratch and it didnt...of course I wasn't gonna gouge it, but just to see if that was what I had handy and was careful that it would be okay...I wouldn't try that with another pan I just bought. I was on the cusp of buying the entire set or a competitors, but this experience has made me jump to the TFal side for sure, with no hesitation. I hope my experience is even better. Can't wait to review! One of the best purchases I've made on Amazon since my journey on here started in November 2015, with over 20 plus purchases. The Shipping was also great and I would purchase from seller again"
"I had such a bad experience with nonstick pans in the past that I swore I was not going to get one ever again - strictly plain surfaces or cast iron for me. But with triplets who need feeding daily (multiple times daily), we needed additional frying pans and based on the great reviews, I gave this a shot. This nonstick makes my old nonstick pans seem like they were lined with glue. Eggs, sausage, french toast, even melted cheese slides right off without any oil. The handle is nice and comfy and stays cool. The heat indicator in the pan is a nice touch, although I find it hard to see so I usually just drip water to see if it's hot. This has become our go-to frying pan!  Update: We've now had this pan for almost 5 years and I just came here to buy a new one. We used this pan frequently, probably 3-4 times a week. As with all nonstick pans, it has slowly lost its nonstick ability over time. Unlike my last set of nonstick pans, we never had any flaking, it has just become less nonstick. In one spot it has also recently gotten a very thin coating of some sort that I can't or soak off, kind of like a scorch mark. It doesn't affect cooking, but does affect the nonstick in that spot. All in all we've been pleased with this pan for the price (obviously, since we're rebuying)."
"I've been using this pan almost daily since purchase. I've used it for frying eggs, sauteing onions and many other tasks. I do NOT use metal utensils nor put it in the dish washer. The non-stick properties have not diminished at all. The handle is still secure and has not deteriorated at all.  I wish the sides of the pan were a bit taller, and it appears there are options that will fulfill this desire.  I like this pan even better than my Calphalon pans and I am a Calphalon snob."
"I so needed to replace my small fry pan that I use for eggs. After much research, this is the one I choose. I did good! I love this pan. I have used T-fal before, so wasn't real worried. But this pan exceeded my expectations. The heat distribution is comparable to my cast iron - nice and even. It cleans so nicely and easily. Just wiping it with a paper towel has it looking good, ready for the next egg. Although I mostly use plastic or wood in my pan, omelets really need a fork. So far, this pan appears to hold up well to the occasional omelet. Yep! This pan works for me."
"I just used this pan again today and thought I would come on here to see exactly how long I've had it--purchased on April 13 this year so almost exactly 6 months. I use it to cook egg whites probably about 5 times a week, also other cooking/sauteeing. Sometimes pancakes. I use medium high heat a lot because I am impatient. Besides how durable it is, I also really appreciate that it sits flat on my glass-top stove.  I do take care not to stack other pans in it (unless I put a paper plate between them), I let it cool prior to washing and I use only silicone or wooden utensils. Prior to this purchase, I bought non-stick skillets at Sam's Club and they would be great for 3 months and then start getting sticky or scratched looking and I would keep using them till I couldn't stand it anymore. This T-fal is great so no more of that!  12-13-15--Update: Just now, after over a year and a half of daily use, I am seeing some scratches in the finish. I already purchased another one last month because so often I want a 2nd pan of the same size when preparing a meal. Looks like I'll be ordering another. It's a great pan!"
"I've been unsatisfied with some of T-fal's recent cast-iron offerings, but I'm happy to say this is now my family's go-to nonstick frying pan. We use it pretty much every day, sometimes several times in a day, for eggs, burgers, steaks, veggies, you name it. After about 6 months, it's going strong. It's still flat and unwrapped (we have a gas range, for what it's worth) and the finish is still intact. Of course, we take proper care of it, but you nonstick users will know that's not always enough.  I don't tend to notice the Thermo-Spot, because I've been cooking long enough to know when the pan is the right temperature. To me it's kind of a gimmick; your mileage may vary, though. It certainly doesn't hurt. I just kinda ignore it.  Washing this, for me, is usually a matter of swishing boiling hot water in it while it's still hot or warm from cooking, and then wiping it with a paper towel. That usually gets it quite clean. If not, I use a nylon brush and dish soap for about 20 seconds and it's spankin' clean.  All nonstick pans fail eventually. However, this is cheap enough, and durable enough, that when it's ready to head to the landfill, I'll probably just replace it with another of the same. Glad to know T-fal is still doing something right!"
"I waited about 2 months to write this, and the verdict is, I absolutely love this pan. It’s big and in charge, great non stick, no issues with the coating whatsoever. It’s actually hard to believe that ppl have had trouble with it. It doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere, but only time will tell. If you were questioning if you should get this beast, just pull the trigger."
"I have been using this brand for 10 years now and I love the durability, the cooking temps and the ease of cleaning. My wife purchased one of their competitors pans...( the blue diamond ) and that competitors pan was junk within a month. We cook allot of spicy meals which will usually destroy allot of non stick cookware. The acidity of those dishes will usually remove the non stick characteristics from most pans. But this brand stays strong and has never disappointed me."
"I just purchased my SECOND T-Fal Nonstick 12"" fry pan. My first 12' pan lasted TWO YEARS of hard use in a home environment. That is remarkable. I have purchased a number of other brands of non-stick skillets and none of them lasted that long. Typically the non-stick starts peeling off of my skillets, no problem with peeling on the T-Fal Professional - that baby hangs in there for quite a while. Considering the price, I am really impressed. Don't clean them in the dishwasher, hand wash only. The one thing that I don't like, and I am not going to knock a star off for this, is the red temperature indicator. The indicator (which I can say I never utilize), makes a raised 'bump' in the center of the pan. Any oil or butter you use will run to the outer periphery of the pan, that is not helpful when you need oil in the center of the pan."
"I bought this pan as a birthday present for my wife... WAIT!! STOP!! Before you start male bashing and do the ""what kind of a husband are you? Buying your wife a FRYING PAN FOR HER BIRTHDAY! YOU INSENSITIVE PIG!"" stuff, let me say this... we have a ""no present"" policy in our house... we've been together for over 40 years (Married for 37 and I lived with my hippie chick for a couple of years before we got married) and over these years, we've settled nicely and there's not much else we can get for each other... so we agreed a few years ago to forget the ""presents"" thing and instead we go out for a nice dinner, or go to the casino or do something else ""FUN"" together... We've had a T-Fal frying pan for many years... originally bought via QVC... and over the years, the non stick coating wore off in several spots... My sweetie mentioned several times that we need to replace it but was unable to find the 12"" pan locally. And... I retired this year and part of retirement means new duties... Whoever cooks gets a pass on dishwashing... and since my cooking consists of scrambled eggs, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and Burger King, as a rule it is me that does the dishes. Have you ever attempted to wash a non stick fry pan with missing chunks of non stick? It's UGLY! So, this was a ""mutual gift""... something for both of us... She loved it!! The pan was everything the seller promised - it arrived on time and in good shape - and we have already prepared several nice meals in it... and it cleans WONDERFULLY!! I am not an insensitive pig... so there!!"
"I had recently got fed up with my All-Clad nonstick pan. I paid a couple hundred dollars for a brushed stainless non stick pan, and after just a couple of years of use, it was not only no longer non stick, but it was like velcro for food! Now, I cook daily on these pans, and never at excessive heat, nor do I use abrasives that may remove the teflon coating, yet after normal use, I ended up with a completely worthless and expensive piece of steel.  Having been gifted a T-Fal stainless non stick pan and reading some reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this a shot. If a $30 pan gives it up after a year, who cares right? Well, this pan exceeded my expectations. On a gas stove, the aluminium heats up quickly (though it is prone to hot and cool spots) and cools off just as fast for easy cleanup. Compared to steel and cast iron, this is a time saver.  As for the pan itself, the rubber handle always stays cool except sometimes nearest to the pan. Just be careful grabbing there if you've had it on the burner for a while. Cleanup with a sponge and soapy water is all it takes. I wouldn't recommend the dish washer as in my experience, it won't always get all of the food off and then the heated dry kind of bakes it on. A quick hand wash takes care of that though.  I haven't had any issues with the nonstick coating flaking or getting scratched off. I take care to use silicone utensils to cook with on these pans.  So with the pan being easy to cook with, easy to clean, durable, and best yet, really cheap, I couldn't be happier. For my non stick purchases going forward, I'll be ""sticking"" with these pans!"
"Very pleased overall w/ this pan. I'd all but ceased cooking w/ non-stick pans due to how quickly they typically go from mediocre to awful (and possibly unsafe, too). I was skeptical about purchasing this pan, even after Cook's International rated it as a Best Buy. At less than $25, it's better than a 'Best Buy', in my opinion. (Kohl's also sells it for $10.+ more when they have it in stock, so why bother. . .) I've successfully fried chicken, sauteed vegetables, and made sauces in it, but the original reason I purchased it was just for cooking eggs, esp omeletts. And, it excels at that, even when I don't use any butter or oil at all. Totally even browning from one side of the omelette to the other (and I use 3 eggs in my omelttes, so it's not a matter of a wimpy one-egg omelette tucked away into a corner of the pan). When the omelette is done, it'll slide right out onto a plate w/out any fuss.  Despite what some have stated in their reviews, I haven't experienced any negatives at all concerning what's been described as the 'domed center' in this pan. Maybe it's because I cook on a gas range @ a low-medium heat, and that alleged 'problem' may be unique w/ those using this pan on electric ranges, and probably at too high of a temp. . .  The red 'ready to cook indicator' in the center of the pan is a bit of a gimmick, but it's cheap entertainment, I guess, while one waits for the pan to heat up. Heat conductivity is good, and seems even all over the pan, too. Manufacturer recommends avoidng using metal utensils - they'll probably compromise the no-stick interior. And, since cleanup is so easy, avoid the dishwasher also. Just wait for pan to cool down (to the touch), then gently hand wash w/ a tiny bit of dishwashing liquid, rinse in hot water, wipe dry, and put away."
"I bought this pan in early 2015. Know going in that it likely only has about two years of good nonstick, Im assuming due to heat degradation as I only use silicone on teflon and, being a skillet, generally spends its life on higher heat. Anyhow, the wife bought our third in early '19 and its still going strong. However, it came out of the box with a loose handle which is slightly annoying at most. Im only writing this is hopes that the right person sees it and does a checkup on the riveting machine. I know it would have been easy to return as always, but I was lazy that day and probably hungry. Great pan nonetheless."
"Over the years I've purchased numerous non-stick frying pans. Don't know how the manufactures had the nerve to call them ""non-stick"". The best non-stick surfaces that I've had might last a couple of weeks, or so. On the other end, some began sticking on the first or second time used. Now, I've got to admit, I used products that were mid-level cost. I could not afford taking out a second loan on my car to purchase one of the top-of-the-line non-stick pans. I've recently started watching the public T.V. program series ""America's Test Kithen"". In that series they test kitchen products and announce their best buys, considering both price and how well it works. One of the episodes this year had a review of 12"" non-stick saute pans. One of the top performing models cost around $200.00. The other top performing model, and their ""best buy"", was the T-Fal Professional 12.5"" saute pan, and the cost was listed at $36.00. One of their tests was how many eggs they could fry, one at a time, before the pan lost it's non-stick quality. The T-Fal won this test at about 77 eggs when they finally gave up. Some of the other brands didn't even come close, some couldn't even do one. So, taking a chance on their word, I searched the Internet about this brand and model. Read several comments about purchases of T-Fal not doing well, and notice that other users said you need to buy the correct SERIES of T-Fal. I then searched for the best price. Guess what, Amazon had, by far, the best price for this brand and model, considering the shipping cost (free) in the the product price. I bought this saute pan through Amazon several weeks ago and have used it several times, including the harshest test I could think of, scrambled eggs. This pan is amazing. It does exactly what it's name says, non-stick. Eggs came out perfect, and clean-up was a paper towel wiping it out after cool down. Only problem I've had is that the 12.5"" pan is too big for some jobs, so, I've ordered the T-Fal Pro 10"" and 8"" pans.  UPDATE: May 4, 2013 After a little more than a year and a half later, with moderate use, about 2 to 4 times a week, my 12.5"" frying pan has started loosing it's flat bottom. It would be OK if I had a gas range, but I don't, I've got a smooth surface electric range. But, no problem, I went to Amazon and ordered a replacement. Still cost less than $35.00 and still has free shipping. Just got it yesterday by UPS after only a couple of days. No change in my opinion, the best non-stick frying pan I've ever used."
"I recently bought a whole cookware set that came with a non stick fry pan. However it's often too small for bigger jobs like family stir fries. So when I was interested in supplementing it with a 12"" pan, I settled on this for both the great reviews, and the price. I'm sure I don't have to convince many that often just making an addition to a set of something, or getting a replacement can sometimes cost near half of what the whole set costs. Some of the single frying pans I found on Amazon costs even over half of what I paid for a 7 piece set of good quality cookware. This fry pan is not only top quality in my opinion, but comes at a very reasonable price. It's all non stick, in and out, and the handle is a thick and comfy. As far as the red dot thingy in the middle, I have not see it change to all red yet when heating it up. But that doesn't really matter. It's plenty hot enough in no time and a pleasure to cook with. As far as some of the reviews here talking about oil running off to the sides of it, I noticed that too. But I really can't find any hump or bulge in the middle that accounts for it. I actually think that its mostly caused by people's stove tops that are not exactly level. For this pan is so non stick that oil tends to pool up in drops anyway and you are much better off using butter, or a spray. Actually I have no problems at all with either butter or oil for I just smear it around a little bit before plopping my fixen's in. And there are many here that haven't mentioned a run off at all in their reviews. In any event, I don't mind it or hold it against this fine pan at all. It's top quality all the way, very reasonably priced, and a good size for a big family fry. I highly recommend it... : )"
I like these little pans. It’s just me and the hubby and they are perfect for breakfast cooking. I bought these used and they looked brand new. They are awesome.
"Loved the 10.25 inch version of this pan so added the 12 inch, both via Amazon. Don't know if it's the material or construction but this is a skillet that sits squarely on the burner, heats evenly at various temperatures, wipes out and cleans easily. We got into Lodge Logic cast iron skillets and love them for burgers and steaks but don't like the clean-up. One night when I didn't want to bother with the cast iron, I tried burgers in the T-Fal and everything was better from balanced cooking to full-flavored taste, to ease of clean-ip. Tonight I used the newer 12 incher for grilled sandwiches with the Nordic Cheese Melting Dome (also from Amazon), and everything was perfect. If you go to YouTube and search ""Equipment Review: Best Nonstick Skillets,"" you'll find an informative video on this and other non-stick skillets from America's Test Kitchen, which gave it high marks in the less extravagant skillet category.  Update: After ordering and trying the 12"", we also added the 8"" to the collection. The 10.25"" in our experience is the winner. Perhaps only due to the size difference, it cooks more evenly and thoroughly than the 12"", and the 8"" is fine but small (and smaller in available cooking space than other skillets we have in that same size.) Easy cooking and clean-up in all 3 sizes of this pan, but the 10.25"" leads the pack."
"I purchased this on May 31, 2014. We're still using it and omelettes still slide right out of it.  T-fal says you can use metal spatulas with these, and that you can put them in the dishwasher. We haven't done either, however. Ours washes so easily that there's little point in putting it in the dishwasher.  This is the best non-stick pan we've ever purchased. I can't see us buying any other brand from this point on."
"This is a good skillet! I thought I'd pay a few bucks more than usual when my nonstick skillet inevitably died as the wear item it is.  This pan seems to be lasting longer without developing a sticky surface than any other nonstick I've had. I had an Anolon of similar size years ago and up to this one it was the best I'd had, but it eventually had to be replaced. Got 2 good years out of it plus another not-so-good year. So I decided not to pay eighty bucks for a nonstick again. This one, by all indications, will way outlast that one, and for half the price. Still more expensive than the Target/Walmart specials, but really a lot more durable than those. Now that the cheapies at Walmart are over twenty bucks, it makes sense to get something that will last 4 times longer for less than twice the price--and get better performance across the board from day one.  I don't see a downside to this skillet. I'll get another one when this one inevitably wears out.  UPDATE 12/2019  Just ordered a new one, same as this one.  Been a good pan. In the meantime, acquired a Field cast iron skillet that is so slick it does many things the T-Fal used to do. But for acidic foods like tomato sauces and fruity things the T-Fal is still a must have. Mine is still very good but has picked up its share of normal wear and tear and doesn’t perform like it used to.  Until somebody points me to a $25 pan (or even a pricey one with long term durability) that can do this pan’s job better I’m sticking with it.  Still recommended after wearing it out!"
"For a Teflon pan this thing is AMAZING! I prefer cast iron or carbon steel for my non-stick cooking needs since I don't want to be replacing pans every six months but I decided to try this anyway and was blown away at the durability. I abuse Teflon yet this pan seems to enjoy beatings. It faces it's eggs with a smug attitude welcoming the challenge. It can sit in filth and yet allow the removal of any unwanted scraps left on it with ease. Even if you try to burn food on it to challenge it's ability it seems to have magical powers of resistance. Nothing sticks. It overcomes what many have not been able to face. This thing is a rock star of Teflon pans. I wouldn't be surprised if one morning I came into the kitchen and it had laid a golden egg for me to cook. It's that impressive. But alas, I will stick to my cast iron and carbon steel for my non-stick needs due to the fact that they dont carry the magical chemicals that provide this pan with its powers. I will keep it though, for when it lays that golden egg..."
This is the second T-Fal pan I've bought. The first one lasted about 7 years before the non-stick surface gave out. I have no reason to think this one will be any less durable. It also seems to be the most non stick of any of this type pan I've ever used but I'm going on memory so I can't promise that's correct. It has more heft to it than most aluminum pans this size and I think that's a good thing. I've had other pans that you have to get them half full before they make solid contact with the stove. If I were going to find any fault with it is that it's a bit on the shallow side but that's really a nitpicky complaint.
"Having used this skillet for several months, I can say I've never had a skillet I liked better. The heat distribution is very even. There's a red spot in the middle of the pan that changes in appearance when the skillet reaches the proper temperature for sauteing. Absolutely nothing sticks, so clean up is a breeze. The silicone padding on the handle is quite comfortable. The skillet is light weight. The large size (12 1/2 inches wide) lets you cook more food at one time. And, just like cast iron or ceramic-coated cast iron skillets, it ca be used in the oven at temperatures up to 500 (that's five hundred!) degrees. It also has a generous slot in the handle for hanging the skillet. What a great skillet! I just wish it came with a lid.  A couple of notes: 1. Even though it's ""dishwasher safe"", if you really want it (or any other non-stick cookware) to last, you'll wash it by hand. Because the skillet is so light and the non-stick is so good, hand washing is fast and easy.  2. Make sure you get this exact model. As of this writing (5/25/13), it is the only one from T-fal that has a silicone-coated handle, good to 500 degrees. The rubber-coated handles are only good to 350 degrees.  I would absolutely recommend this item to anyone."
"I've used T-fal pans quite a bit, I have 2 12.5"" ones currently. I ordered these because one of mine is quite worn and needs to be replaced. The price point for the pack of 3 seemed really good considering a single 12.5"" was listed at $33 by itself. The picture shown on the 3-pack shows a grey pattern of sorts on the frying surface. The 2 pans I currently own also have that grey type pattern. However when these arrived, they are just a plain black bottom with the heat spot. I am not sure if these are considered a step down from the ones with the pattern on them or if this is a new design. It would be beneficial to people buying the 3-pack to know exactly what it looks like and if the quality is lower than that of the other design that is pictured. I don't plan to return these and from the looks of them they should perform just fine. Just pointing out the difference so if anyone else chooses to purchase they know they aren't getting what it shown in the picture."
"So this isn't entirely non-stick, and I've tested it a few different ways. I've tried just whisked eggs on low heat, just whisked eggs on high heat, butter then whisked eggs on low heat, and butter then whisked eggs on high heat. None of the above were truly non-stick, you're still scraping small bits of egg off the sides, BUT when I moved up to pancakes, those were completely non-stick. Either way, we bought this for the size and price, so it fits its purpose. It's a bit hefty, too, so the heat distribution is great, even on our janky, lopsided stove."
"I really like this pan and use it all the time. Clean up is really easy, and the size is good. It's also lightweight, which I like. But I notice that heat distribution is not even. If I'm frying chicken breasts for example, the ones in the center will get browner then then ones on the edges, so have to keep swapping places. But overall, I like it and am glad I bought it."
I have been using my T-Fal E93802 Professional Total Nonstick skillet for over a year now and I must admit it is my favorite go to skillet. I use this skillet over all the rest of my skillets and even over some that cost 4 times as much. For the price it's a GREAT bargain. It cooks everything evenly and it is a breeze to clean. It even has a thermal red dot in the center of the skillet telling you when it's the perfect cooking temperature. It's a very durable skillet that can be used on a stove or put into an oven.  They come in a variety of sizes which I think is wonderful. After I wash mine I put a little olive oil in the skillet and lightly coat the bottom and sides wiping all excess oil off. You won't be disappointed in this skillet if you decide to purchase it. I highly recommend it.
"I was recently put on an extremely low-fat diet by my doctor due to some gallbladder trouble. I'm not allowed to cook with oil any more. This news was frustrating, not because I love oil, but because I'm a stainless steel All Clad girl, and it's nearly impossible to cook with zero oil in my All Clad pans.  After seeing a recommendation from America's Test Kitchen, I ordered this pan. I figured it's cheap enough if it sucks, it's no big deal.  Holy. Crap. I've never been happier with a frying pan in my entire life.  Last night I cooked a curry tofu scramble. The tofu was cooked perfectly. It browned nicely without sticking anywhere! The curry sauce I made was oil-free, and I added it to the pan. It too cooked perfectly. The pan heated evenly, which is saying a lot because my old stove doesn't usually heat evenly itself.  And the best part? Clean up was a snap. The pan basically wiped clean. I used hot water, a little Blue Dawn, and my fingers, and the pan was clean in under 90 seconds.  This pan totally freakin' rocks, and is cheap enough that if it dies in 2 years, I don't mind buying another one."
"The first thing I noticed about this pan was it's weight. It felt solid, like a steel or stainless pan. Cooking with it, it had perfect heat distribution on a gas range. Omelets were evenly cooked on the bottom by the time they were ready to be flipped and rolled. Very easy to clean, and so far, dishwasher safe.  I did not rated the scratch resistance, because I refuse to mistreat my Teflon pans by using steel tools. I just won't do it."
"We’ve had this pan in all three sizes for three and a half years. They get used nearly every day of the week for breakfast, and about twice a week for various dinner needs. We have done stove top to oven countless times with no issues. We only use silicone utensils and hand wash them. They are still like new with no scratching or peeling. These have lasted longer than any other non-stick pans without issues. I would absolutely recommend them!"
"This is heavy, strong, sturdy, and non-stick. I had a similar one that wore out after 4-5 years of making my kid breakfast every morning (stoped becoming ""non-stick"" in about 4 year). I'm hoping this one last a little longer. Note: these say dishwasher safe, so I clean out any food residue with a wet paper towel, then run through the dishwasher. Sometimes I'll hand wash. but I'm not sure if the dishwasher is why it worse out after 4-5 years. They do say ""dishwasher safe"" though."
"this is my second Tfal frying pan, the first one had the waffle pattern/carbon fiber look to it, but since that one did not seem to be available, i got this one to replace it after 5 years. Someone indicated that this pan has a convex shape to it. I did notice that it is slightly convex. I doesn't really bother me, but i can see why some don't like it. What i like about this pan is the durability and easy clean up. It is supremely non-stick. I wouldn't recommend metal utensils though."
"This is the second of these pans my husband and I have purchased. We're both avid cooks, so this gets daily use in our kitchen. The previous pan has lasted almost 2 years (pretty awesome for a non-stick pan with such heavy use), and in fact we're still using it, but it's not quite as non-stick as it used to be. But there's no chipping, scratching, or peeling of the coating at all, so it still seems safe to use. It makes for very easy cleanup (hand-wash, of course), and being able to use it in the oven is a handy feature as well. I can't imagine finding a non-stick pan that we like better.  Pros: - Durability - Size/shape (12"") - Ease of cleanup - Oven use  Cons: - Thermo-spot doesn't seem that useful -- old one never changed color much. Haven't noticed if the new one does. - Underside of pan gets stained easily, if you care about that (requires abrasive cleaner to get it pristine again)"
"Buyer Beware of the false advertising...  The online product description states that the product is oven-safe to 400 degrees. However, the instruction sheet accompanying the product states that the handles and knobs are oven-safe to only 350 degrees. The online product description also states that it's dishwasher-safe. However, the instruction sheet accompanying the product states that ""we do not recommend that you place cookware in the dishwasher."""
It's been a good pan. We use it almost every day. I wanted to post a picture after two years of use.
"This is just a four-month-old pot, but when I cooked a regular dish a few nights ago, the glass lid EXPLODED!!! I just added water in the pot hoping to make a stew, so no it was not overheated. Good thing it only cut my finger. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!! Or just don’t buy it at all if you wanna live."
"Great quality, nice weight, good feeling handle with a non-slip grip, and decent non-stick capability (nothing's quite as good as teflon, but teflon's been banned; toxic-to-the-environment manufacturing process if memory serves). The glass lid is sturdy, seals nicely, has a sturdy non-slip handle, and a small hole to vent steam and protect from vacuum sealing the pan when it's been off the heat for a while (which could be dangerous if you tried to force it off).  Now my husband and I make breakfast every weekend. He makes the bacon and hash browns in this pan, then I make sunny side up eggs. I turn the heat up to medium, spray a little Pam (for delicate edge crispness), add the eggs, cover the pan, leave it on the heat for 1 minute, and off the heat for 45 seconds, covered all the while. I can see through the glass lid (past the condensation) as the albumen over the yolks ju-u-u-u-ust cook, leaving the yolks nice and runny. I've found that a lot of restaurants don't make good sunny side up eggs (raw albumen on top, yuck), but with this pan, they're perfect every time!  There's great depth to these pans. I can't wait to make some of my favorite dishes that require a goodly volume and a good tight-fitting lid. Spinach and broccolini dishes come to mind.  Update: After using these pans for a while, I’ve found that the shape is absolutely perfect for flipping whatever’s in the pan. In fact, if you shake the pan, it WANTS to flip. Great shape."
"we bought this pan the second time, since we were so happy with the first one. This time the bottom is not flat. The center is higher, oil runs to the site. Not sure if that is a single failure or if others see similar problems, we will not buy it again, there are other options."
"Lackluster performance - barely a year old and non-stick coating is totally compromised. I babied this pan, always hand washed and never even used it in my oven. I am very disappointed, as 11mo is a very short life for a skillet in my opinion."
"This is an absolutely incredible skillet. It heats the pan evenly and no matter what I put in it, it doesn't stick. I have had this for two years now and it quickly became the only skillet I use. I have never had a better skillet to cook eggs in! I usually wash by hand as it is so easy to simply wipe clean, but do put it in the dishwasher on occasion to give it a deep clean. Even after years of constant use it does not show any signs of wear. None. I only use wooden or plastic utensils in it, but I am not overly cautious and am not shy with my stirring so have no 'babied' it at all. Extremely pleased with this product."
"I read thru all the reviews on Amazon for this pan before buying, I have an older model which is still in perfect condition by the way after years of use 2-3 times a week, but, I needed another for my travel trailer. I just used this pan today to make an omelette, I agree with another reviewer that the improved design does make it easy to flip eggs or fold an omelette, maybe a little better than the older design. Cleanup was with a damp paper towel while still very warm, 😊 wiped out like new, zero effort. I never put non-stick in the dishwasher, ever, and I use usually Oxo non-stick safe utensils. Last point, I saw a few reviews showing damaged non-stick, eh, it looks like they left a dry pan on very high heat way, way too long, with cast iron or carbon steel that's fine, you will likely have to season it again, but, with a non-stick surface, haha, that's abuse, they are not designed for that purpose...I'm an engineer. 🙂"
"I bought this pan about 18 months ago to replace a very old one of a similar style. This pan is my workhorse and I've used it nearly every day for the past 18 months. Like many reviewers have stated, this pan has a slight curve in the middle that will cause liquid to run to the outer edge, but I don't really see that as a big deal for a pan at this price.  The pan developed a few small chips because the towels I placed between my non-stick pans to protect the coating came off and I didn't notice, but since then I've been hanging it up with a few others. Most non-stick pans say they are dishwasher safe, but don't recommend it. I only wash this pan by hand and have had zero issues with the finish; the non-stick surface works as well now as it did when I bought it.  The bottom line is, don't put this pan in the dishwasher. Don't use metal utensils. Don't stack other pots or pans inside of it without some sort of padding. Treat your cookware well and it'll last you for many years. I would definitely buy this pan again."
"No, really. It's an amazing pan. And yeah, I do have a soft spot for kitchen implements of all sorts. I was impressed with this pan from the start, but I've been burned before by pans that start off easy to clean and with an even heating surface and then end up staining, chipping, peeling, sticking or otherwise disappointing. Not this one! I used it again this morning to cook Christmas breakfast and thought ""Hey, I've had this pan for a while now... and it is still freaking amazing. I think it has earned its 5 stars."" And so here I am, sharing with you the Christmas miracle (purchased in June) that is this pan. If you ask Santa for one present that makes food hot - make it this pan."
"We bought a T-Fal set but it did not include a large fry pan. This 12"" pan is great. It distributes the heat evenly when used on our gas cooktop. The best part about it is the size. The sides are tall enough yet with enough slope to make it easy to scoop and stir. The handle remains cool to the touch. The surface is non-stick and does not scratch as easy as our old Teflon set did. This T-Fal pan is a big win Update after 33 days: After 33 days (past replacement window of course) we noticed the rivets on the handle had come loose. The handle was still functional but wiggly. T-Fal was not responding to warranty requests due to Covid. So we asked Amazon and they accepted the free return and refunded the purchase price and we then purchased another 12"" frypan feeling like we got a one-off bad one. Good job Amazon!"
"This new pan is great. First, it’s just the right size for my “meals for one” meals, since I only have to cook for myself. Second, it heats evenly, so food poisoning is a thing of the past –mostly. And even though I don’t know the kitchen magic and desperately miss having someone around who is, I can still make the most basic meals quickly and efficiently. Cleanup is a cinch with the non stick titanium coating, leaving me plenty of time to try to figure out why I’m so very alone. The handle is firm and easy to grasp even when wet, for when, you know, you really just want to hold someone. Or, something. And the lid is easy to keep on the pan… but not these emotions. They keep bubbling up. But the pan, oh my, the pan is good looking and sleek, like Derrek. Stupid Derrek. What did she see in that guy anyway? Does Derrek have new titanium plated pan? No he does not! Anyway… the lid is transparent, like my ex whenever she was around Derrek. Sorry, sorry, this is starting to stray. I should get back to the point. It’s just that, it isn’t that I gave up on loving again, it’s only that started to feel that I was too old to love. To start over with someone new. And where would I even meet them? Not at the pan store, that’s for sure. And now I’ve got this thing, I don’t know, it’s OK I guess. Just wish I had it earlier when she was still around. Then I could have hit Derrek in the head with it. Well, time to wrap up this review. Remember to give feedback as to whether or not you found this review helpful."
"I bought one of these 12"" skillets a couple of months ago. I was delivered within 2 days (I'm a Prime member) and it arrived safely packed and undamaged. It comes with a very nice vented, clear glass lid. The construction is very solid - it feels well-made and a little heavy. The material it's built from (Titanium) appears to be excellent - no more worrying about flaking Teflon. I did a lot of research on no-stick skillets and this brand (company) often made it into the top 10, so I thought I'd try it out. The price is excellent considering what you get.  I usually cook on high heat and so far, have had no issues (no warping, charring, distortions, etc.) with this skillet. I mainly cook omelets but have also cooked chicken breasts and steaks. I usually cook with Canola or Olive oil and sometimes Coconut oil. Some people have claimed that you don't need any oil or anything to prevent sticking when using these. I experimented with cooking eggs with no oil and it was nearly a disaster - the eggs stuck for the most part (not too badly though). I don't cooking without some sort of oil to prevent sticking.  My biggest complaint is the bottom of the skillet. I have a gas range and unfortunately, the bottom of the skillet is extremely slippery. On a few occasions the skillet nearly slipped off the stove. I got used to it and was more careful and to date, have had no accidents (keep the little ones away from this when it's used for cooking). The other thing about the red dot in the center (inside the pan) glowing red when it's ready... meh. I haven't noticed it glowing. None of these issues really lowers my rating on this product. I recommend it. We'll see how it holds up over the years.  Also, I just bought a second one recently because it's a solid product and I couldn't stand my awful Rachel Ray Teflon skillets anymore.  I hope this is helpful."
"None of this T-fal stuff is flat. This is the second chance I've given them, but both of the ones I've bought are raised in the middle so oil leaves the middle of the pan and collects around the edges. It was too inexpensive to return, but I wish they'd get their act together. Yeah, it'll work, but is it really that tough to sell a frying pan with a flat bottom?"
"I have been reading some of the reviews left for this pan. It's hard to imagine I'm reading about the same product, however, after seeing some of the photos posted, I can imagine that the pan is not performing to it's peak. I purchased my 12"" pan in October of 2020, and I use it several times a week. It still looks brand new. Better yet, it is without doubt the best performing pan I have ever had. Yes, I use stainless steel pans as well, but sometimes you want something that you don't have to scour to clean, or are preparing something you don't want to stick. This is definitely the pan for the job. Nothing sticks to it and I am consistently amazed at how easy it is to clean. I do not have aluminum showing through, no flaking, no crusty bottoms, nothing but an efficient, convenient, lovely pan! Take care of your pans people. Don't let them get nasty with built up grease and burns. I don't put mine in the oven nor do I put it in the dishwasher. If I need something for the oven I use stainless steel cookware. I love this product and absolutely am happy to recommend it to you."
"I was extremely lucky getting my first pan like this from a Goodwill in like new condition. I have used that pan for over five years now of heavy use and the coating is just now starting to fail from little scratches and from heavy use. It still works fine, but the aging coating is why I went ahead and got this new pan. Which is also great! I got the 12"" skillet this time and it has been perfect. I was a little leary with some of the reviews on this product, but it is completely flat, and the coating has been holding up very well!  I do take care of my pans, only using silicone or plastic tools on it. I hand wash them as they are super easy to clean with the coating. I never use it in the oven, and if I were to put a pan in the oven I would use a cast iron over a teflon coated pan.  I have been using this pan only since Jan and it's nearly May. There are no scratches in the coating, no blemishes, no warping, no issues of any kind that have come from using the pan thus far and I use it regularly. Proper care goes a long way with these."
"Context: As a rule, I buy the best tools I can afford. Its cheaper in the long run - pots and pans are a good example of this. Buy once, cry once, as they say. Except for my daily non-stick pan which I expect to replace fairly regularly (2-3 years generally). I use this pan sometimes 3 meals a day and it gets so much use I dont expect the nonstick pan to hold up forever. Id like to say I dont baby my pans, but honestly, if I was at your house, Id probably be personally offended how you treat nonstick. All that being said - this pan does the job, seems quality, feels good in the hand, and most importantly for my electric range, it has stayed flat.  If I have to old-man grumble: Its a bit light, but that comes with advantages too, quicker response to heat and easier to handle."
"This is a great skillet. Wife asked for a large non-stick several years ago for Christmas, I chose T-fal because of its reliability and peer reviews on this skillet. Not disappointed! After 3 years of being cooked in atleast 4 times a week this skillet is holding up fines. There are a couple of tiny pits in the Teflon (SOMEBODY wanted to use a fork to flip bacon) but that was not the skillets fault. Keep to wood and silicon utinsils and this baby will last you a long long time. Love, love the vented lid as well! This will only be replaced by another T-fal skillet.... one day."
"I deliberately waited for a while to write a review on this pan so I can review about its durability. It is now eight months since I've been using it and I use it regularly. I am someone who cooks regularly and am comfortable with making recipes that are elaborate and time-consuming. I make traditional American recipes but I also cook French, Indian and to an extent Mexican food all of which require durable pans. As an avid cook, I also must admit I'm harsh with my utensils so the pans I had purchased from the run-of-the-mill brands usually looked quite used or scratched by 8 months.  I decided to purchase this pan because I desperately needed a nice pan but also I have a bias towards this brand T-Fal (or TeFal) since the brand is French and so am I. I also of course read all the raving reviews here on Amazon but had a hard time believing that a pan so good would be so cheap. I have payed five times more for pans in brick and mortar stores for a lot less quality. During the last 8 months, I have done everything under the sun that you would expect to do with a pan; sauté, fry, boil, re-heat, slow heat etc. I have cooked hard vegetables (like carrots), soft veggies (like kale), fruits, all kinds of meat and lentils. Some of my cooking which is normally extremely demanding on the average pan takes very little toll on this one. This pan really IS non-stick. I have REALLY deep fried chicken Southern style yet all the scrapings came off with almost no muscle power. Both the pan and the lid are completely unaffected by my ratty old dishwasher which could use a replacement. The thermo-spot heat indicator is an added bonus for me. Now I don't have to play guessing games anymore on when the oil is preheated enough to sauté or fry items. However the only caveat is the scratch-resistant part. Yes, compared to the run-of-the-mill pan, this pan holds up well against scratches but it is not 100% scratch-proof. There were couples of occasions that I can remember where I cleaned the pan in a jiffy with a wire brush which caused a dinger on the pan (which you can clearly see in the picture). So definitely don't expect this to be fully immune against scratching from metal. But other than that, this pan has held up really well to my use of the pan and has become my favorite pan of all. I find myself always picking this pan from the rest when I'm cooking. I like when a kitchen utensil is functional but I like it even more when the utensil is also hassle-free cleaning because while I love cooking, I hate the aftermath cleaning part. So in that regards, this pan is also great because it requires minimal effort to get it looking sparkly again. For the price I paid, I'm extremely pleased with the quality and durability of this pan and recommend it to anyone who needs pans on the daily. I'm attaching pictures of the pan from when I received it (that's the picture with the T-Fal booklet), during various cooking processes and one taken 8 months after use. I hope my review was helpful."
"I loved the first one so much that I got a second one. Most of my daily cooking is stove-top. These heat evenly and have not shown any sign of warping. Man, is it hard to find a skillet that does not warp! These apparently don't.  I was afraid that the vertical sides would be frustrating to deal with. But I got used to that quickly. They increase the capacity. Decrease the spillage.  Having perfectly fitted lids for skillets is way more valuable than you might think. Most don't offer them.  As you might imagine, the soft handles do insulate your hand from some of the heat, but they are not perfect. They will get warm after a while. But since they are long handles I usually don't notice. I grab near the cooler end anyway. Since these are 10"" and lightweight, they are quite easy to move around in a hurry. I appreciate that the lid also has an insulated handle. And a grometed steam vent.  I don't think the weird indentations on the underside serve any real purpose. Or the record-like grooves. They serve to make it a little harder to clean the underside. But that's not that important. And it's probably just T-FAL's signature. It may also be part of how they strengthen the bottom against warping without adding more weight. I'm not sure.  I was happy enough with the first one. So I bought a second. I would recommend them."
I have used this non-stick pan every day since it arrived. It has remained completely free of any defect. It remains perfectly flat which is important since I have a glass stove top (which I hate). It is easy to clean. I take excellent care of my kitchen pans so here is what I do. I never use spray oils such as PAM. Every time I use the pan I put several drops of canola oil in the pan and wipe the inside with a paper towel. After I use the pan I allow it to cool and then use only water with minimum soap and a paper towel or non-stick scrubber and then when dry I use a quick swipe with the paper towel I used before cooking. I expect this pan will last for years. Why do I go the extra mile when it is non-stick? Because I want it to last for years and even though it is not expensive I treat it like it is. Highly recommended.
"We bought 3 non-stick pans - the HexClad at $129.99, the GreenPan at $59.99 and this one (non induction if you are wondering) at $43.86 This one wins hands down for us - the green pan was just not non stick enough for us, the HexClad is beautiful and can be put in the oven (metal handle) but the rim is nearly impossible to keep clean without using chain mail style sponges to scrub. The T-fal was not my bet but it heats quickly, has a nice little graphic to show you when it is up to temp (expectantly useful) and is amazingly easy to clean with a little soap and water. We have NOT tried it in the dishwasher yet and probably never will - it is just too easy to clean quickly with a brush in the sink and we use it constantly. After 6 months we are still cooking sunny side up eggs without sticking (we do mist with a little olive oil) and have found nothing - even cheese we cook for crispy texture sticks much - burnt cheese just requires a soft spatula to remove. Hope this saves someone else the trouble of figure this all out - we plan on buying more of this brand to try their pots and other pans."
"This is a great pan! We purchased this to replace a T-Fal 4.2 quart covered pan which served us very well, that sadly, will not work on our new induction range. This one does work on induction. I do wish it were as large as the old pan, but this is still a nice size, just barely smaller than our 3 quart sauté pan. It should be just fine for two people. Incidentally, not sure why T-Fal (or Amazon) calls this a fry pan, when it's clearly a sauté pan (due to the essentially straight walled sides), whereas the T-Fal actual frying pan we have, they call a sauté pan! The nonstick coating on this pan is excellent, the same type we had on three other pans. Like any Teflon based surface, it's not scratch proof, but it does seem to hold up far better than other Teflon based nonstick pans we've had. The lids fits tightly one this one and the handles feel great! To top it off, the price is also great, and it has a lifetime warranty. Highly recommended!"
"This is the first nonstick pan that is still as nonstick as it was originally. No pan that I have had before actually remained nonstick for very long, so far it is only like half a year but compared to others I am very happy with it. Nothing sticks to it, so far but as the surface looks the same as when new I am sure it will keep working well into the future. I am not finicky with it's use but don't over cook stuff and scorch the pan but did not on previous ones that did not hold up. So far nothing I have cooked that left anything in the pan could not be removed just with the sprayer on the sink, no scrubbing to remove stuck stuff, wonderful. I don't use metal implements in it but did not in the old ones either so it is a good comparison.  I recommend this pan. As always, your results may vary due to your usage but treat it well and it will give you good service."
"I've had several different skillets over the years. I even had a set of T-fal cookware that came with several pieces. But, I find that when you buy a set you end up with several pieces that are too small or too large or you just don't like them. So, over the last few years I've been buying individual frying pans and soup pots, etc. My husband wanted a skillet that he could make an omelet or a big pancake. He found this on Amazon and asked me to buy it, so of course, I did. I didn't expect to LOVE IT! I love it so much that I've already purchased a second one and may purchase a 3rd one.  It makes everything taste so much better! Grilled cheese, eggs, pancakes, french toast, a hamburger! It really doesn't matter what you put in there...it cooks evenly and easily. The pan washes so easy it blows my mind! Now, I did invest in a whisk and tongs that are rubber coated. I bought them here on Amazon because you do not want to use metal in the pan! I make sausage breakfast gravy and needed a whisk. It is well worth the investment! I actually enjoy cooking more just because I love this skillet so much. I hope you love it too!"
"This review is for the T-fal E9189774 Ultimate Hard Anodized 10-Inch Deep Fry Pan with Lid (I recently bought on Amazon) The skillet heats evenly, great non stick finish. Only problem is it will only fit 4 pieces of Butternut Sandwich Bread if I remove a corner off of one slice. I'll live. I actually purchased this skillet to use with the Eggssentials Egg Poacher Egg Rack.  I read a lot of reviews on Amazon, for several Egg Poacher Pans, all complaining about having their hands burned by the steam coming from the steam release holes in the plate that holds the egg cups. It's because the holes on all the Pans I looked at have the holes directly under the egg cup handles. Weird. The Eggssentials Egg Poacher Egg Rack doesn't have that problem. The steam is dispersed throughout your pot. And the handles for the Eggsseentials performed the same as the high quality black plastic handles on my (1987 & 1995) Revere copper bottom pots. They stayed cool even with the glass lid kept on this pan. Also, this pan is wide enough to set the rack in and leave 1.5"" all around. (The rack measures 7.25"" in diameter ) The pan is also deep enough to use the rack with the glass lid on with about 1/2"" to spare. The Eggssentials Egg Poacher Egg Rack was also bought on Amazon Really happy with both purchases."
"So far, this frying pan has been superb. First, it was perfectly packaged and delivered exactly on time. It was easy to open and there was nothing to assemble. The pan itself is heavy--not nearly as heavy as a cast iron skillet, but heavier than most nonstick pans. The sides are about an inch and a half deep, and they are nearly vertical--good for browning meat and frying chicken; not so good for omelets (but the pan is too large for omelets anyway). I did season the pan as the instructions suggested. This is easy to do, and it seems to have helped. The lid is very tight fitting, but it has a steam escape hole, and the handle on the lid is insulated so you do not burn your hand when you lift it. This is an excellent feature, something I did not have on my previous frying pan, and I always had to keep a pot holder around when I was using it. I have been using this pan for only a short time, so I cannot say how it will hold up, but so far I love it. Highly recommended!"
"These have become my new favorite pans. I still treat mine like ""regular nonstick"", ie: no metal utensils, not putting them in the dishwasher, so I can't speak to their durability in those situations. I do know that after months of use, these pans still look brand new. They are VERY easy to clean, NOTHING has EVER gotten stuck to the inside to the point where I couldn't wipe it off with a paper towel. I find the outside a little more difficult to clean, but even that is not really difficult, just a light scrubbing with the dish brush. I do sometimes wish they could handle higher oven temps, because I'm afraid to damage them, I love them so much. We had some very expensive nonstick given to us for our wedding, and those were showing wear and scratches, after 1 1/2 years of being ""babied"". The T-Fal Ultimate Hard Adonized has outperformed that set in every way.  The only negative I can think of is that T-fal has several tiers of nonstick, and they don't all appear to be equal, even though they look VERY similar. There's ""Signature"", ""Ultimate"" and a few others I think. Make sure you buy the ""Ultimate"". I think it's the only ones that say ""metal utensil safe"" on the packaging/description."
"What I love about this pan is that I can clean it quickly and thoroughly with a paper towel. I usually fry things lightly in a little oil. Then while the pan is still warm, I use a paper towel to wipe it out. It comes out perfectly clean and looks like new. I had also purchased one of those copper looking pans at the store and when I used oil in the pan, it stuck totally to the pan and I couldn’t get it off without a lot of hard work and elbow grease. That was horrid and I returned it. Just be careful with your pan not to turn up the heat too high. And never put cold water on a hot pan. That could cause it to warp. Use a nice oil like peanut oil or avocado oil. It doesn’t smoke."
"I returned a different set of pans that I was not pleased with and bought this single pan. Well worth it! The heat distribution seems good, nothing sticks, it's been used multiple times each day on a daily basis for a few weeks, has been in the dishwasher at least five times (washed by hand when we had time) and no issues! I was careless and did use a metal spoon most mornings lifting out my sunny-side-up egg, but no damage (I don't have a heavy hand). I know this may sound trite, but thank goodnesss that Amazon (Prime) stands by its products and promisees. In a pandemic there is nooo way for an elderly person to run out to stores, shop around, buy and return items in person. Amazon is a lifeline and most of the products are spot-on when it comes to reviews. One does have to read the reviews carefully, as the reviews are integral in getting what one is paying for. I usually go for reviews with over 200 respondents (but's that's just me). Anyway, good pan, good product and it stands up to our heavy use and my occasional abuse which means it is reeeeealy good!"
"It's too bad all the negative reviews get voted to the top -- assuming the same product is still being produced 4 years later this is just the best non-stick pan for the price. I use this almost daily. It looks brand new and the non-stick doesn't have a single chip. Just amazing. Every other non-stick pan I've owned (usually in the 10-40$ range) starts chipping or getting sticky a couple years in. I came back to this item since I want another one.  Also -- SO easy to clean. Honestly, for 75% of things I cook (like eggs, satueeing veggies) I'll just wipe it out with a paper towel the next day and not wash it. If I get really saucy stuff on it I'll do a quick wipe with soap and water and it's clean in <30 seconds.  I don't use abrasive materials on this pan -- just spatulas and turners. If I used something hard and scratchy then yes maybe it would chip? I don't know."
"You literally get what your pay for. Even a cheaper T-fal pan tends to scratch easily or start peeling. This is a high quality pan. I've used it for just about everything including baking fritattas. Its super easy to clean, and despite my use of metal instruments in it, has yet to scratch from cooking. My fiance put a scratch in it because she cut something inside with a steak knife. But even that seems like it doesn't affect the cooking. The heat distrution is mostly great, EXCEPT I've noticed a little bit of a cool spot right in the middle. I mean, no flame hits that part of the pan, so I guess that makes sense - but I would have hoped the temperature would be distributed there as well evenly. Despite that small insignificant flaw, this is the best pan I've ever used. I even use it to fry a single egg because the non-stick is so great. (even though I have several other small pans that would seem to be easier to use). If only all pans were this good. I've been using it for about 3 months now, ALL THE TIME. I don't anticipate it will wear out for a long time."
"UPDATE 12/25/2020: Doubling wrapping handle in wet paper towels and tin foil WORKS to prevent pan handle from melting at oven temps above 350! Cooks Illustrated says use 2 layers of wet paper towels covered by 2 layers of tin foil. Baked 4 cheese potatoes for 25 minutes at 425 and covering handle as described above worked very well. I use this pan almost every day; it's my ""go-to."" Although I thought the pan might be deeper, it holds a considerable amount of food. I really appreciate having the pan ""tell"" me when it's hot enough to begin cooking. It's very, very, very, easy to clean. I use a Dobie scrubber to remove food residue, but there's really nothing to ""scrub."""
"This is literally my only non-stick pan. I've used it a few times/week for 5 years now, and it still looks and functions perfectly. I put it in the dishwasher most of the time, otherwise I use a sponge and NEVER a scouring pad on the inside. If you're scratching this product or the coating disappears, you're using it wrong. Non-stick pans are not meant for super high temperatures, and non-stick doesn't mean you don't need to lubricate it. No metal utensils should be used in most any pan  The thermo-spot thing is gimmicky and stopped working after a few uses. Besides that, I have zero complaints, but, that is taking into account that I paid ~$23 on sale. I think I'd feel similarly about it even as a $40 pan considering how much use it has had."
"Cooking for a family of 4 on a daily basis, I needed a good ""daily driver"" pan that was on the slightly larger side. Most of the ""12 inch"" pans that I've tried are 12"" at the *top*, but only 9-10"" at the *bottom* due to heavily sloped sides...and the bottom is where you cook, so you run out of space. The sides on this one are much straighter, so the usable space is almost exactly the same as the claimed measurement - a welcome change.  It's light enough that my children can handle it on their own (they can't lift my stainless steel pans), it fits in my vertical-style pan shelf (many other 12"" pans don't), and I can cook for the entire family in it. The non-stick surface is very slick, and foods still brown nicely.  The ""T-spot"" thingy is an ignorable gimmick. It doesn't add anything, but it isn't hurting anything either, so I just ignore it."
"I use an electric range, so I cannot speak of use on gas or induction stove tops. I used this pan nearly every day for the past 10 weeks. It has been stellar. I always, literally always, use wooden, nylon, or silicon tools when cooking in this or any other non-stick pan or pot. It's the only way to make them last, else eventually, the metal tool will damage the pot or pan. I only use metal tools in bare metal pans. I always preheat the pan on medium or a little below, and never start it off on high heat to warm it up. Most pans, unless they are cast iron, carbon steel, or have a thick metal slab on the bottom, will eventually warp it you preheat them on anything higher than medium then add colder food to be cooked. Preheat at medium, and if needed for the recipe, then crank up the heat 15-30 seconds before you add the colder food. I have never had a light gauge pan warp that I used in this manner. The pan has remained unscratched, hasn't warped, cooks like it should, and it cleans up really easy. Highly recommended."
"... I watched reviews on youtube and read reviews here, and the ones that have shown and stated this is a great non stick weren't wrong. I know T-Fal isn't your high end All Clad type pan, but it definitely competes with the expensive pans when it comes to non stick and good heat distribution. I've been using my T-Fal for a few months now and am very impressed. I've fried eggs and made pancakes without using a drop of any sort of oil or butter, just the dry pan, and nothing sticks, and it is extremely easy to clean up. I just use the soft sponge in the sink with regular dish soap and it wipes right out clean as a whistle. Bottom line, the pan can match the most expensive of pans for non stick, easy of cleaning and scratch resistance for a fraction of the price. I'd definitely buy it again and also recommend it."
"Super impressed by this pan! This is head and shoulders a better buy than any skillet I have gotten in the past 5 years. Perhaps the only knock is that the sides are a little vertical for any fancy-schmancy manual food flipping. I have had this pan for a couple of months now and the surface is like new despite daily (sometimes multiple times a day) use for everything from meat to veggies to sticky sauces, to stir-fries and outside of a little stickiness from the (admittedly self-inflicted) burnt-on grease on the outside of the pan, it has performed (and more importantly) cleaned up brilliantly. I will be looking to buy a full set of these soon to replace the motley collection of pans I have accumulated which have not lived up to their promise."
"After a year and a half of almost daily use (sometimes several times per day) I wanted to come review this pan to say how much I love it. It's a great value. I do hand wash it always - dishwasher is not needed, it's so easy to clean - and I do not use it in the oven. The non stick coating is still in perfect condition, I make sure to never use metal utensils when cooking with the pan (first rule of non stick!). This is great for cooking up single meals for myself or to cook meals for the whole family of three and I cook all sorts of things in it from bacon, eggs to spaghetti sauce, quesadillas, meats, etc. I use the lid a ton as well with it so I appreciate a pan that comes with such a nice CLEAR vented lid with the silicone handle. I would still highly recommend this pan and would buy again for myself or for others."
"It seems like I write a lot of 5 star reviews but I guess because I research the heck out of things before I buy them. Researched this pan after having other pans never stay non stick and also warp. Turns out the warping was my fault, I learned putting s hot pan in cold water is a giant no no. But the non stick on other pans stinks. But I did also learn that I may have been heating them too high. Either way, my always using medium heat, I've never had to add any oil unless the recipe called for it. This is a good all purpose pan. Good for a few eggs or a couple of burgers. Also, can do up to about a lb of ground turkey for sloppy joes etc. love this pan and expect it to last many years."
"This is the second time I have bought this pot. The 10inch one I bought before is enough for two people. This time I bought a larger one for the whole family! The reason I like it is the non-stick pan, which conducts heat quickly! Things are cooked quickly! A very good one, this one will probably continue to be bought if it is worn out😀"
"My husband read some of the negative reviews, but the positive ones made him still go for it, and I'm so glad he did!  We love this pan! Use it almost every day, and clean up is so quick and amazing! Glass lid is very substantial and even though this pan can handle lots of different cooking, it's not too heavy when cleaning. We had burnt cheese that just slid right off when washing it!  Maybe some people received a defective pan, but we've been cooking with this pan for almost a year, and haven't experienced any of the negative issues mentioned. We're careful not to have the stove flames too high, and we also never use metal utensils, and it has rewarded us with great results.  We wanted to find a good pan to cook with after we got tired of the brand name copper ceramic pans that kept failing on us. They worked well initially, but then after just a few months, food would start to stick and then it went quickly downhill from there! After we went through 3(!) of the copper ceramic pans, my husband got fed up and found the T-Fal pan! You should give this pan a try!"
"I love this pan. I was sold on the review from the guy who came back like two years later to show daily use wear and tear. Nicest pan I've owned for less than $100 bucks.  EDIT: I am back after one year of daily use to show my photos. In the interest of contributing to these reviews just like the guy who's review convinced me to buy this in the first place. Let it be known that I do not let anything dry or cure to this pan. It is cleaned as soon as it has cooled down enough from cooking, every single time. Also, I have only ever used silicone tools on the cook surface. Never any metal cooking tools, or abrasive cleaning materials. This is after about a year's worth of daily use.  I HIGHLY recommends this pan. I actually just bought my second one because my girlfriend does a lot more cooking than I do."
I like T-fel pans but this one surpassed what I was looking for. It is a heavy guage pan and truly non stick. It heats evenly. When I fry potatoes or cook scrambled eggs I only have to use a small (not even a tablespoon) of oil. I use this pan a lot. I don't have a dish washer (I don't like them) so I can't judge it in that area. I do know it cleans up easy no matter what I cook in it. I enjoy cooking so I'm fussy about my pans. It is at a good price and am happy I did buy it.
"I made fried chicken first thing in this pan, and the heat distribution system is wonderful. I didn't have to use as high heat to get to the needed temperature. Cleanup was super-easy, food just slides off and it only takes a few seconds to get it clean. I tried cutting a piece of chicken in the pan, a small cut, to test the surface, and it showed nothing, not a scratch. It's lighter in weight than my old pan that size, and that helps with my weaker grip. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"When Cooks Illustrated mentioned this as one of their favorites, I was highly dubious. ""T-fal? Isn't that sold at like TJ Max???"" but it's a great pan. Comes up to speed quickly, has an even heat surface, and so far it's kept it's nonstick surface in good shape. If you're looking for a ""daily"" nonstick workhorse, I highly recommend this. Save the money you'd pay for an All-Clad nonstick and put it towards some copper core pieces instead."
"Have used this pan regularly over the last 4 months and absolutely love it! Before using the first time, I washed it (by hand) with soap and water, but since then mostly just wipe it clean with a couple of paper towels. I heeded the instructions and NEVER use metal utensils or on high heat. Even so, medium heat puts a nice sear on a steak. I've never timed how long it takes to turn the ring red, but since my ancient stove doesn't have an extra large burner, I do let it heat for at least 5 minutes. The lack of a larger burner means the 12-inch is really bigger than I need, so I'll be ordering the 10-inch version. No idea how it performs in the oven bc I have an iron skillet for that."
"The red color indicator is kinda nice actually I didn't think it would be a big deal but when I'm pre-heating the pan and preparing something, I can tell when it's up to temp and if I'm not quite ready yet to cook, I turn the heat down so I don't just let the pan sit there and get too hot ... it's a nice feature. The non-stick surface is not quite as good as I've seen in other pans HOWEVER, I can tell that it's going to last a long time vs other pans which might be a little more slippery, but they wear out fast. It cleans up nice ... little dish soap and a sponge and even caked on hamburger helper comes off easily. After you clean it, just put a drop of olive oil on it and wipe it on with a paper towel and you're good to go for the next job.  Excellent quality pan, it was a good purchase."
"This pan is just flat-out awesome! I was looking for another large frying pan to use in conjunction with my Ecolution pan. I recently got into weekly meal prepping (a great time saver and portion control tool where you bulk cook your meals for the week in one day and then store in BPA-free containers in the freezer/fridge to reheat over the course of the week). I actually thought I had chosen a T-fal pan with an additional side handle similar to my Ecolution pan. When the pan arrived, I was disappointed I had chosen the wrong item as this particular pan has only one handle. Much to my surprise and delight, I discovered that although this pan is larger than my Ecolution pan, the weight distribution of the pan and its sturdy handle enable me to easily lift it from the stove (even filled to the brim with veggies). I seasoned the pan before its first use with some olive oil, and even after several uses, it continues to be a breeze to clean. Planning to get another one!!"
"This review is for the 10 inch Pro Metal with lid. Many reviews here are for different products. After a long search for a ten inch nonstick pan with lid that works on an induction range, I decided on this pan. Was Leary of T Fal because they do make dinner cheaper quality products.  Very happy with what I got! Good quality, great heat performance and great nonstick properties. Other reviews I'm not sure how they use their pans. Looks like they cook transmission parts and store them with a hammer. You have to care for your pans.  So far very happy, will update after more time using the pan."
"I bought one small pan to test it, as I have become skeptical of recent advertising claims of other cookware and have thrown several in the trash after just a few weeks of disappointing results. The heat distribution is excellent in this pan as well as the nonstick feature. Therefore I bought 2 more in graduating sizes. These pans are perfect and a breeze to clean with just a sponge. They are also dishwasher safe and come out great in the dishwasher, but I always want them handy, so I usually just wash them quickly by hand and put them back in the cupboard. Great investment!"
"I'd been using a Tramontina nonstick for about 4 months before the nonstick surface started to fail and the warped base didn't sit evenly on my glass cooktop anymore. This T-fal is much sturdier than the top-rated Tramontina and feels similar to my smaller, more expensive All-Clad skillet. I also like the ergonomics of the handle, which I wasn't so sure about in the pictures. I tend to abuse my pans, cooking on high heat every night to sear and then throwing them into the oven to bake or roast. (I don't understand the point of buying a pan you should only use on medium-high heat, but that's actually what some manufacturers suggest.) I've had this skillet for about a month, have used it every night, and it's as good as new. (The bottom looks great btw. By now, I would have expected scratches or dark marks from using high heat, but there aren't any.) This T-fal has been a really pleasant surprise and I'm planning to buy the deeper 5-quart next."
"Let me preface this by saying that I have only had this pan a few weeks, but let me also say that I: (1) cook a lot, (2) have owned many different pans in my life, and (3) am a bit persnickety about cookware.  Things I love: the weight (substantial, but not bulky, definitely not flimsy), the surface (very non-stick, but eggs still need a bit of butter!), and usefulness (this is the new go-to for everything pan in our house), and the extreme ease of cleaning (no scrubbing of any kind!).  I look forward to having and using this pan for many years to come."
"I’ve been buying mom-stick skillets for years, always ignoring directions not to put them in the dishwasher. As a result, I have damaged the finish, both inside and out. I finally decided to search for a dishwasher-safe option and I came across this one.  It’s well-built with great finish, both inside and out and distributes neat beautifully. It comes out of the dishwasher sparkling clean. They do advise you to “season” the mom-stick surface every few washes, to keep the non-stick functionality."
"This nonstick frypan is the best. The only pan to get if you can have just one pan in your kitchen. Truly nonstick. We've been using this pan for a year now. It's as nonstick as ever. We use it every week day for breakfast, and often for supper too. Cleans up, inside and out, with soapy water, nylon scrub pad and sponge. Some wear and tear on the outside of the pan where the gas burner grate and the pan rub together when the pan is turned or shook back and forth to even things out in the pan. About what you'd expect from a rugged pan. If this one ever wears out (no sign of that yet!) I'm getting another one just like it if I can."
"I killed my last 12"" skillet and had done without one for close to a year because I made due with a 10"" pan. When I saw the one I bought at a steeply reduced price, I decided to take a chance. I didn't know what the damage was - ended up being a mangled original packaging which didn't damage the pan and lid. What a great deal! This is the best fry pan I've bought yet. It distributes heat evenly so you can actually cook 6 slices of bacon and they all cook nearly the same rather than the two outside pieces taking longer. I now know why it was so expensive originally. I am really a happy cook with my new pan and lid."
"I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I FOUND THIS ON SALE. I HAVE BEEN NEEDING A NEW FRYING PAN FOR AWHILE NOW. I HAVE1 THAT IS LIKE A 10 INCH AND THAT IS TOO SMALL FOR SOME JOBS AND I HAVE 1 THAT IS 14 INCH AND THAT IS WAY TOO LARGE FOR EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT GOES LIKE 2 INCHES PAST THE HOT SPOT ON MY GLASS TOP STOVE AND THAT MEANS I HAVE TO SPEND ALOT OF TIME STIRRING TO KEEP THINGS COOKING EVENLY. I HAVE PROBABLY USED THIS A GOOD 10 TIMES NOW WITH ALL KINDS OF ITEMS BEING COOKED AND NOTHING HAS EVER STUCK TO THE BOTTOM. I LOVE THE CLEAR LID SO I CAN WATCH IT WHILE IT COOKS AND NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE LID OFF AND ALLOW THE STEAM AND HEAT TO ESCAPE. THE HANDLE DOES NOT GET HOT AT ALL AND IT HAS A HOLE IN THE END FOR HANGING. IT DOES SAY ITS DISHWASHER SAFE, BUT I HAVE NEVER PUT A PAN IN THE DISHWASHER AND IT WASHES SUPER EASY BY HAND AND VERY QUICKLY."
"I have purchased non-stick pans since they first came out and have not been impressed by the non-stick abilities of any of them. Last year I succumbed to a TV ad featuring a copper colored non-stick frying pan and on opening the box fell in love with beautiful copper finish and kept it on my stove as a visual compliment to my kitchen. That lasted about a week because after using it 2 or 3 times, the copper colored coating became discolored and the non-stick properties failed as well. I was about to swear off non-stick frying pans when we spent a week in a time share and when I went to use their frying pan, I discovered it to be a T-fal non-stick pan and it obviously had a lot of hard use. There were many small scratches in the finish but to my surprise it worked beautifully and cleaned up with just a rinse and a wipe from a paper towel. I figured that a pan in a time share got a lot more use than in a family like mine (2 people) and on top of that, the timeshare only had a metal spatula. To make a long story shorter, I ordered one of these from Amazon and after many months of use, it still looks pristine, food doesn't stick and it cleans up with a soak of water and Dawn, a rinse of plain water and a dry with a paper towel. I use a metal spatula and it hasn't scratched at all. (the T-fal instructions say that metal is fine as long as you try to chop or cut what you are cooking) In short, it lives up to my expectations and I LOVE IT! Just to forstall any questions, I received no compensation of any kind for this review"
"It arrived in one of those Made In China cheap cardboard boxes, so I put it aside for later. I then determined by checking online that it was the pan in the box and opened it the next morning. It looks amazing ! I washed it by hand and started using it on my gas stovetop at setting 3, which I have found is around 300 degrees. I dropped in some chicken and eggs and a few other things and ended it by heating up a tortilla and making a burrito. All the food slid right out and barely was a trace anything had cooked in it, even the butter. My All Clad tri ply will have to sit by for now because it doesn't have a non stick surface, but it can be useful for high temp or a second pan. This T-fal pan is wonderful with one limitation of 400deg max on temp setting or you risk burning the non stick coating. It will be the everyday pan for all those things that would normally stick to the pan, just be sure and don't go past 4 on the burner dial."
"I bought the 10” & 12” with lids. I bought them to replace yet another set of expensive, non stick $100 pans from Williams Sonoma. These T Fal pans are SO much lighter then my previous pans, making it much easier to lift & empty heavy contents into dishes. I LOVE the depth of these versus the traditional 10” & 12” skillets as well. I have owned so many non stick pans and I have never found a pan SO easy to clean by hand as these, and I bought them specifically so that I could throw them in the dishwasher. So the dishwasher durability remains to be seen for me. The handles on these are very sturdy too, they don’t feel like they’re going to give out on you even when the pan is very full. So far, these are my favorite non stick skillets, and I’ve owned green pans, Williams Sonoma pans, and a ton of different non sticks from Walmart & Target, all of which ended up in the trash. I’ve always found the coating to begin peeling within 6 months to a year of using them and they never hold up to multiple dishwasher use. It will be interesting to see how these do. I’ll definitelg have to update this review."
"Great quality frying pan. I bought this pan and the 12 piece set for the group home i work for. With some re-educating of my staff on how to,properly clean these by hand, they'll last a lot longer than the last ones. They are all pretty light for cookware and no one has complained to,me they are too heavy. They are used daily, and will recive some abuse over the years, but in the short time we have owned them, we have been able to cook without oil or butter to grease the pans. I cooked salmon in this pan with no oil or butter and it came out awesome. Clean up was easy too because nothing actually stayed stuck to it. I wiped it out of the,pan with a dry paper towel. Very happy with this purchace."
"BEST PURCHASE BY MISTAKE EVER.  So I already have an 11 inch wok and an 8 inch frying pan. So I wanted another frying pan especially when the boyfriend comes over and the food and process time doubles up. So I wanted to get one that was inbetween sizes and wouldn't defeat the purpose of my wok.was in search for a 9 inch frying pan but those are more difficult to find with quality. So I saw the good reviews this one got. I wanted a shallow frying pan as well and since it came with a lid i thought it was a nice bonus and I knew this was 10"" (I tried to weigh out the pros and cons of 10"" when I already have my 11"" wok especially since I have a tiny stover in my kitchen right now that can't fit both at once perfectly). So when I got this I thought WOAH this is too huge. I was not expecting it to be so deep. I barely had space in my cupboard to store it and I was ready to package and return it. But you know what? I tested it out once and I made space for it! This frying pan has changed my cooking experience.  One of the issues of having an electric stove is that coils don't sit flat. They're lean so my food is always drifting off into a corner while I'm trying to cook anything. Even with the wok I have the same problem. But this pan... is...a life changer. It's very sturdy and weighty that it makes the coil on the stove lay flat and my food isn't leaning (as much- every other pot would be at a 10° angle, this pot sits 4° this is all a rough estimation out my head). I can make large pancakes, I can fry bacon and eggs at the same time without the two colliding in the pan. My chicken dishes get cooked evenly without having to stir so much like in a wok. My wok still has it's usage for certain things but I'm loving what this pan can do so far. It's very easy to clean because of it's non stick feature. I would highly recommend this to someone else in need of frying pan as well as a nice cooking pan to anyone.  I must say I read that when the pan is ready the t-fal will turn red but I'm yet to see that happen. Oh well. It works great without that sign."
"I've been cooking for myself for about 45 years and love stove top cooking. Mostly stir fry vegetables. I'm no gourmet, but after a long day at work, I like cooking a fast meal with an easy clean up. I usually throw some fresh vegetables in the pan, some combination of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, mushrooms, kale, snap peas, sometimes with some canned chic peas or pinto beans, with a tablespoon of olive oil, some spices, cumin, curry, some soy sauce and in 5 minute I have a nice healthy meal. During cooking I might add a splash of water. And the glass lid keeps the splatter inside the pan and helps it cook faster and more even. I've had a lot of nonstick pans that usually wear out and get tossed. But this pan is thick, sturdy and well made and has a nice fitting glass lid with an exhaust hole. But the amazing think is it's nonstick qualities. I've had it for 6 weeks now and nothing has stuck to it that could not be easily wiped off with a sponge under running water. After 6 weeks it is still like new! Not a spot on the inside or outside. The outside bottom is still as shiny as new, no blackening at all. The inside surface has not warped and is very flat. The instructions say to only cook on medium heat and not higher. But at medium heat food cooks very fast. Stir fry in 5-6 minutes. After cleaning I put a few drops of olive oil in the pan and coat the surface to season it. I think this will last a while and I highly recommend it."
"I bought this Non-Stick pan to compliment my Stainless Steel set. I use the Stainless Steel for meats, sauté and searing. Needed a high quality Non-Stick for delicate food, like eggs, fish, etc. Love this pan. Little butter and eggs slide around easily. Have yet to break a yolk in a month. Included lid is heavy duty and works great. Really fits well and keeps heat in, to greatly speed up cooking times and minimize splattering. Like all pans, you need to follow the care instructions if you want it to last. No pans should be hot when immersed in water, don’t use really high heat, etc. Most uneven/warped pans are from over-heating or placing a hot pan in water. Let it cool down first, otherwise it will warp. This goes for almost every pan. I would absolutely buy this pan again and wish I bought it years ago. Do yourself a favor and buy a quality silicone spatula set to use with this pan."
"I use a 12” skillet nearly every night and end up replacing it every few years. The last one was a Green Pan, which had not stood up well at all. The T-Fal I got as a replacement is sooo much better. Super flat bottom and it doesn’t seem like It has the potential to warp, nice vertical sides, very effective nonstick surface. I also like the temperature indicator. If I could change one thing, I would add a little handle opposite the normal handle... a 12” skillet is large enough (or heavy enough when holding food) that a second handle would make it a little easier to work with. Overall though, this is hands down he best pan I own!"
Spectacular frying pan. I used it for the first time this morning and I am so pleased. I was able to cook over low to medium heat because this pan heats up so evenly and holds the heat. Nothing stuck to it and the butter I was using for taste did not get brown because I did not have to use high heat to get things cooked. The pan was super easy to clean. I just swiped it with a plain sponge and a little dish soap then rinsed in running water. Love the glass top so I can see how things are progressing. The slightly higher than usual sides helped me to not dump the contents on the stove as I pushed food around and flipped it. Now I know what I will be giving my daughter for Christmas. I am confident that she will love this ultimate frying pan as much as I do.
"This pan is freaking awesome. I always buy a new set of T fal nonstick pans every year because we are rough with ours and i don't want to take any chances with non stick chemical bits ending up in my food. I didn't realize that this pan was different from the standard ones I always get. This is like some sort of special version. It as heavy as my All Clads, which says a lot about quality and even heat distribution. And I also LOVE that it cleans up easier on the outside of the pan. It even states that on the back that there is some sort of magic coating that stops all those horrid scorch marks from sticking (my All-Clads don't have that and iIwish they did because they all look bad on the bottom. I am taking EXTRA good care of this pan and I am hoping they offer more sizes in this special version style"
"I love this pan, I've only had it for a little while but so far it's great! Really nice non stick, haven't had any issues with anything sticking. I think this pan size is pretty much perfect but that is personal preference. The only down side I have noticed is that there is a tiny bit of exposed metal at the end of the handle closes to the pan that I did grab by mistake once, which was pretty unpleasant. But as long as you are aware of that and are reasonably careful I can't imagine it would be much of an issue."
"A lot of my pots and pans went away with the Ex. he left me with the ones that weren't nonstick. So have had to replace items. Saw this one on a CNN recommended product list. My requirements aren't that heavy. So the frying pan does what I need - it is easy to clean and the high sides left me do things like steam veggies. It seems well made & should hold up. But I'm not a person that spends a lot of time in the kitchen with a lot of requirements for a frying pan. Still, if you are a cook I think you'd be happy with this pan."
"I bought a T-Fal fryer thru Amazon that I REALLY like a lot so I was looking at some of their other kitchen products - I cook a LOT!  I ordered this covered fry pan and I was very impressed. It gets rave reviews, and deserves them.  I cannot complain about the hodge podge collection of pots and pans I have used for so long, as they have served me very well, but everything about this pan ... well, lets just say that many of mine ""rocked"" on a glass stove top, and the non-stick surfaces looked like they had seen a lot of use - which they had.  This may be hard to describe. If you can imagine tapping on new Teflon (from many years ago) with a fingernail, and get that ""plastic"" feel - this is completely different ... the finish on these things is VERY hard.  Anyway, I liked this so much I bought the entire set, and separately ordered their Jumbo Cooker and some of the larger stock pots that were not in the set."
"This purchase is replacing the same pan I purchased and used daily for two years. It seems many people are passionate about this pan one way or another, so I'll try not to elicit any emotional rebuttals. I shall attempt to compare advertised claims vs. real world applications. Claim #1: Non stick without the use of lubricants. Videos of s'mores and melting/ burning cheese sliding out of this pan are disingenuous. Both of these foods contain enormous amounts of fats in of themselves. No surprise here. Videos of eggs cooking without the use of any fats, no so fast. This may have held some water during the early weeks of use, but quickly diminished. Truth is, a very small amount of fat is really needed to achieve this claim along with a low heat setting. Perhaps cooking s'mores first and simply wiping down the pan with a dry paper towel leaves enough oily residues to achieve this claim as well. Once washed with soap, not so much. Claim #2: Scratch resistant. Definitely better than average, although I would think twice before beating your eggs in the pan or using a metal meat mallet to sound the dinner bell! Claim #3: Dishwasher safe. Does this claim infer the safety to this pan or to your dishwasher? Yes, it is in fact safe for your dishwasher! Your pan, however, will most likely suffer a slow death after repeated washings. This very much depends upon the chemicals you are using in your dishwasher. Conclusion? It is best to hand wash with a minimal amount of soap. Claim #4: Pan stands up to 500 degree oven temperatures. Well this one is just plain stupid. So long as there is food cooking in the pan, the temperature of the pan will never come close to reaching 500 degrees. The handle may, but so what! It's constructed of steel! Want to test their claim in the absolute sense? Place your empty pan in a 500 degree oven, allow it to cook for 30 minutes and then get back to me. The point is, do not overheat an empty pan either in the oven or on the stove top. In conclusion: Overall, this pan has performed better than any other ""non-stick"" pan I have ever used. It offers better non-stick potential, better longevity and better bang for your buck. And no, this will not be the last non-stick pan you will need to purchase unless you decide to boycott this style of cookware in the future or give up the chore, I mean, joy of cooking altogether!"
"I ORDERED THESE IN THE 2 MOST POPULAR SIZES 3 YEARS AGO AND THEY ARE PERFECT, AND I'VE LET THEM SIT ON THE STOVE SIMMERING IN WHATEVER, USED THEM FOR CARAMELIZED ONIONS, AND YES, LEFT THEM THERE AFTER DINNER TILL THE NEXT MORNING. I WIPE THE GUNK OUT, THROW THEM IN THE DISHWASHER & THEY'RE GOOD TO GO. BESIDES EVEN COOKING WHAT ELSE IS THERE? I KNOW! THESE SKILLETS ARE PRETTY MUCH STANDARD SIZE, WHICH MEANS YOU MOST LIKELY ALREADY HAVE LIDS THAT FIT."
"I have used my Gotham Steel 11-inch skillet nearly every morning since my purchase 3 months ago. I prepared the pan as per instructions, and have used it faithfully following suggestions in other reviews and from the manufacturer. I only use it for my egg-white omelets - same EVERY day. I saute some spinach in butter, add egg whites, and top with avocado and a small amount of diced meat. I use medium heat (lower heat than with my other omelet pans). This has worked perfectly until a week ago. Now my omelets have begun to stick. The skillet still cleans up well, but the omelets no longer slide out perfectly as before. I wish the perfection had remained. I still will use my pan, but wish it had lasted longer!"
"Food stuck after only a few uses. I followed usage instructions. Must be a quality control problem. Also - Gotham Steel customer service would not honor their ""90 day guarantee"" because I bought the product on Amazon. They said it must be purchased directly from them."
"Many reviews on this product refer to non-stick capabiltiy problems. I have been using this product for as many years as it has been available. They work, non stick, as the day I bought them. But, there are some absolute No-No's. If you live in an area where the tab water as a fairly high mineral content (most of America) NEVER clean in a dishwasher! Clean with a detergent and a sponge and plain hot water. Rince the pan until the water just falls out and the pan looks dry. Never drop a peice of meat into the hot dry pan, use something between, like butter, fat, something."
"Not happy with this frying pan at all… I've only used it for a little over a month perhaps about every other day and three weeks ago it started sticking with food, to the point that I can't even fry some eggs on low heat without them sticking… Also, there is a scratch on the pan which they claim that the pan cannot scratch… I would like my money back, but apparently my window of return is closed… really? I would not recommend this pan unless you just want a pan that only works for two weeks."
"When I originally purchased this frying pan (as well as the larger size as well) I loved them, and unfortunately recommended them to friends who are most unhappy with them as well. They look good, and for the first month were non-stick, but thereafter not only did they scratch (even though I only use plastic pot scrapers) and even with a little butter or oil, they are absolutely not non-stick. I called the manufacturer who told me to return them for replacement. Well - the shipping would cost me more than a much better set of frying pans, so no-thank you! Do not believe the advertisement!"
"I first encountered these pans at a friends house where I would stay one week in four for business. The Gotham pans were in use daily. After six months I wrote down the product name and and ordered the 9.5 inch pan for Christmas. This pan has been in use now at least daily, as I do omelets for breakfast and serves as the main cooking pan for light dinners. No issues so far. I actually came here to order the sizes smaller and larger and decided to write a review."
"The directions say not to use oil or butter when frying, for example, eggs. I followed the directions and the eggs stuck to the pan. Why?"
"This is a very handy pan to cook at home or take camping. It worked well and I wish it were a bit cheaper (I'd buy more). It's lightweight but cooks remarkably well. And egg whites/eggs are perfectly round shaped. Have also used for herbs and garlic in some olive oil to add as seasoning to dishes. Perfect measure! Cleans very easily. I found a little lid I had hung on to that fit perfectly, when I had discarded the older pan - this really helps to cook eggs evenly. Found a small spatula too in a store close to me."
"Total waste of $13! Supposed to be scratch resistant, it's not! Photos show scratching where I was trying to get the cheese loose from the handle rivets. Pan is non-stick but everything sticks to the rivets and will not come off. I literally have to scratch the rivets with a butter knife to get the food off of them! Total waste of money! Very disappointed. I purchased the small egg pan because I am in the market for a new cookware set and wanted to see how Gotham Steel would hold up in my kitchen. Definitely a NO GO!"
I love this thing. I cook all kinds of stuff in it. But my favorite thing honestly is shells and cheese they cook in no time flat water boils before I even realize it where other stainless steel pans take 7 minutes or longer. My mistake was cutting a steak up in the pan. Went right through the coating. I've had it for about 3 years now it is my favorite band. I just wish the The Edge was squared. More surface area would be nice
That's the only one I was missing and Gotham steel was out of for a while so I got lucky and found it on Amazon now I've got all eight of them on the skillets yeah I know why does somebody need eight skillets hey who knows. but yep I pulled the cheese test with them and they no oil and fry an egg test and all that good stuff and just like in the infomercial list did exactly what it was supposed to do even wipe the burn on cheese out with a paper towel I was impressed but if you want to invest in a good set of skillets this was the cheapest one it was less than $10 but the other ones were quite a bit more. PS if you can't cook don't buy them because they don't help you cooking I know I found out the hard way I was hoping it'd help me cook better but it didn't hahaha.
"this is a good nonstick pan at a good price. the pictures show potstickers i made, the pan after cooking, and pan after cleanup. you have to use a cooking spray and low-medium heat. this pan is not for searing. food will stick, but it comes off with soaking in water and gentle scrubbing with a paper towel. i have not tried to scratch it. this pan is a great deal compared to all-clad for example. this alum version is very light, compared to the stainless steel version"
"I now have six pieces of Gotham Steel cookware and have been 100% pleased with all of them. Some people have had problems with the Tri-Cerama copper [colored] lining scratching/cracking/shedding and/or having food stick. You can completely avoid these problems by following these simple rules, which are basically those with which you'd treat teflon linings.  1) Use a lower temperature than you would otherwise. The aluminum heats up very quickly.  2) Never use a temperature higher than 500 degrees F. Despite the advertising claims, Gotham Steel can't take the 600-650 degrees (or more) needed to make from-scratch pizza.  3) Never use metal utensils. Never. Ever.  4) Do not try to lift or move food before the bottom of it has had a chance to cook somewhat.  5) Before washing, let the pan/pot/skillet/whatever cool to room temperature.  6) Only use a plain sponge to wash. Sponges with a scouring side (white or other colors) will erode the lining.  6) Never put in dishwasher. The grommets holding on the handle will corrode from harsh dishwashing soaps. Hand wash only.  I've used the 10½"" square griddle about 100 times now. The surface is absolutely perfect. If I still had the box, I could repackage it and sell it as new. Imagine what a teflon coated griddle would look like after 100 usages!"
"I've been using this pan multiple times a week for the last month or so. I mainly use it for fried eggs and omelets. It is the perfect size for a one egg omelet. It's nonstick surface is very good if used correctly. I can make a couple recommendations for using it. 1) use a little bit of oil or butter. (A little goes a long way) 2) use low heat. I cook eggs at a setting of 3 or 4 on my electric stove. 3) if you do 1 and 2, you can clean it by wiping with a paper towel. It will wipe completely clean and be ready to use again. Try it, you'll be surprised."
"Making a lovely scrambled egg or eggs is one of the most difficult things to master in the culinary world. BUT, with this fantastic pan YOU or anyone can do it. What a pleasure. Easy to clean and use. Instructions say low heat and not oil or butter. Trust me, you'll want a knob of butter. Low heat? Yes. Of course it can do anything a good pan can so its not limited to eggs but you get the idea. Buy 2 or three. You'll love them!"
Ideal for one hamburger & makes the perfect size egg to fit my sandwich. Easy to clean & nothing sticks.
"I only enjoy over easy eggs, but my husband likes scrambled. We have a 7 inch pan similar to this one but because he scrambles his eggs it is full of scratches even though it was supposed to be scratch resistant. So I purchased this one to use just for my eggs. So far so good. It is smaller then I thought so I can't make my grilled cheese sandwiches in it but it is an egg pan so. The size is almost perfect for one egg (which is al I'll eat), however flipping it can be difficult. I still love it!!!!"
"I absolutely love my Gotham pan. I think I want to add more to my kitchen. It is super easy to clean and I have not had to put it in the dishwasher once. I have cooked both vegetables and meat. You do not need any cooking oil or butter unless you want to add a little extra flavor. The only think I would add is that I learned you can find this exact item at a store like Rite Aid for a few bucks cheaper, but what is a few bucks if you get a lifetime of good cooking?!"
"Have to admit, opened the package and thought Amazon sent me the wrong item. This pan is little more than toy-sized, more appropriate for an Easy Bake Oven than a modern stove. Still, despite its very light weight, it seemed sturdy enough, so I washed it and have tried it out a few times. I had previously purchased a larger two-pan set from Costco and have been very pleased with them to date. But I wanted something slightly smaller for everyday use. Was hoping this pan might be it, but it is really far too small to be practical. The company missed an opportunity here to produce something in-between.  The horror stories you read about this coating I think are from misuse rather than the product itself. I've had to adjust my cooking style to adapt — using absolutely no cooking spray, the propellant bonds to the surface basically destroying its nonstick properties; and using a lower temperature to cook at because the surface distributes heat far more effectively and efficiently than Teflon — but overall, these pans are ideal for nonstick cooking. My only gripe is that they seem to be fragile; within a week of using them, I noticed a small chip in one surface. Not sure how it got there, as I don't use metal utensils of any kind while cooking, but I'm thinking it must have happened while I was hand-washing it, possibly dropping a fork or knife on it in the sink. That it chipped so easily was, to be sure, quite disconcerting.  Bottom line: I highly and unreservedly recommend this brand ... but not this particular product, which is too small for any practical use."
"We use the 9.5"" pan for omelettes and scrambled eggs. However, we use a lot of butter in the pan. Over-easy eggs stick. This is the second one we purchased. We purchased the first one in May 2016, and the second one in November 2020. We also purchased two of the 11"" pans. The first in March 2018 and the second one today (August 2021). We use the 11"" to saute meat. Both sizes have lasted longer than other non-stick pans. (I wasn't able to write a separate review for the 11"" pan.)"
"it works like most copper pans, though the guarentee is great, the paying for shipping isnt worth sending back when it gets a scratch, and most of the copper pans do wear down and scratch. the price is cheap and buying a new one is the best deal. It is an amazing pan and we love the non stick , if used correctly, no metal or knifes, it last a long time"
"This is the 2nd red copper Mini skillet I've owned. the 1st one worked beautifully for about 2 years before small scratches begin to appear. that's not bad at all for the price. it's only $10. I eat a lot of eggs and they slip right out of this Pan. I do use non stick cooking spray to facilitate that. if you do that and you hand wash it and you do not use metal utensils in it, you will be very happy with the way it cooks."
Food sticks and it doesn't just wipe off. I hate this pan and the others I got. Returning it is a laugh they ignored my emails. The first two times I used it it was great but after that it started sticking and it doesn't clean easily. We washed as directed and followed instructions. DONT BUY THIS BRAND ITS FALSE ADVERTISING. I SM NOW STUCK WITH EXPENSIVE PANS I CANT USE.
"We have several Gotham steel skillets from Costco plus a smaller one of similar quality. They are all great and hold up better than any non-sticks we’ve had over the years. We have stainless, carbon steel, cast iron, porcelainized…as we are all cooks. I’ve wanted a single egg pan for a long time. This one is super. It works perfectly and has a generous girth enough to allow for an egg ring. I love it."
"This is basically a one-egg pan, but also handy for heating up a single burger or a child’s portion of pizza pockets or chick’n bites. Although no oil or butter is required, eggs are better with a bit of moisture from butter or even a little water to prevent a dry skin on the food."
This was not the first Gotham Steel pan we ordered. We have a few different sizes.  We also have ordered ;pans for relatives as gifts - they too like this brand of products.  These heat well and SUPER EASY to clean.  They do not add a strange flavor to the food like competing products do. .
"Wife mentioned needing some new pans a couple months before Mother's Day while shopping. She pointed these out, so sneaky me took snapshots of them so I wouldn't forget. Found them on Amazon and ordered this and the larger 5.5 quart cooker with glass lid. She loves them!! Very easy for me to clean and it gives even heat distribution."
"GOTHAM STEEL 11 inches Non-stick Titanium Frying Pan by Daniel Green  I am totally surprised by the negative reviews for this product. Hopefully sharing my ways of usage, will help others to enjoy their pans? I have used this pan for 13 month and it still pretty much works the same as when I first bought it. (and it is a very slight difference) I have had non-stick pans, that by now, would have been in MUCH worst condition. I can still wipe my pan with a paper towel and it will wipe clean. I was drawn to try this pan because of the ""nonstick interior coating is PTHE, PFOA and PFOS free"". I am an anti-chemical person. I feel so much of the cancer today is caused by environment, including the type of food we eat and how it is cooked. I cannot help but wonder if the negative reviews are the result of improperly using this pan? I do preheat my pan. I do not use cooking spray as that is a NO-NO for ANY NON-STICK PAN!!! I learned that many years ago with my Non-Stick Caphalon frying pans. I only use olive oil mostly, also butter or margarine, even though it says you don't need them... I just do not like the FOOD FLAVOR of cooking on a bare pan. I could never saute onions without olive oil! I also only use wooden spoons or non-stick utensils...I guess I can't change old habits. The manufacturer states- ""Please Note this pan needs to be used on a low to medium flame"". I can understand why, if you are not adding oil or butter. I never use it on high...usually preheat on medium and will turn-up to med.high heat if I want a little higher heat, depending on what I am cooking...but, not a continuous med. high heat. Maybe I have been able to do that because I do use olive oil? I never wash it in the dishwasher. Because this has lasted longer than other non-stick dupont teflon pans, I give it a 5 star."
I was surprised with this pan. Insert stated no butter or oil needed. I made eggs and a grilled cheese on low heat without butter or oil and they came out great. I also tried making something with butter and it also was perfect. Pan cleaned up quickly. Heat in pan seemed even. I have hand washed even though it claims to be dishwasher safe. So far a good bargain at this price.
"I love these pans. After 4 years of intensive use, grilling chops and steak etc, I finally had to replace my trusty old pan. Such easy cleanup! They don’t last forever but they do take a lot of abuse quite well, better than other pans I’ve tried. Definitely better than conventional non-stick. I have bought 5 or 6 of them now, different sizes."
"If you use it correctly this pan will Be your best friend. Keep in mind it's only $20 and isn't going to last a lifetime. I use mine on a daily basis (in and out of a very hot oven as well) and it didn't start to lose its perfect non-stick surface until after about 9 months. Impressive for the price. And honestly I used it twice a day. Then bought a new one. And I can't wait to buy another. Love love love this PAN. Also just because it says ""non stick"" doesn't mean you can cook like an idiot and expect the food to not stick."
This was a phenomenal pan it was easy to just fry some eggs especially when you're on the go first thing in the morning. I highly recommend this to anybody that is looking for a pan that's not that Teflon norm ally when you got little ones that you trying to feed for not getting that in their food.
"I bought this pan after using it a AirBNB property. Like most non-stick pans you must use utensils that won't scratch the pan. My first one lasted two years of regular use and started to stick once my kids started using it with metal spatulas. Great, inexpensive fry pan which will last for years if used properly."
This little pan is great! I have decided to get more pots and pans like it cuz there is honestly no sticking even when I don’t use oil or butter! My hubby loves fried egg sandwiches and I used to dread making them but the heat distribution is great on this little pan and he is diabetic so keeping oil down is great! Now I can cook an egg just right in no time at all with little cleanup time.
I have had this pan for a few months and it is very nice. So far no scratches and nothing I cook on it sticks. It beats the one I had by a long shot and I wish I didn't settle for it for years.  I would buy this pan again.  *I have never tried it without butter or oil
"The pan itself is fine. The handle is not up to anyone's standards, being thin and uncomfortable to hold. I've used the pan 4 or 5 times and cleaned it a few times. It's easy to clean, and it hasn't scratched yet. It hasn't warped yet. It's probably worth $15, but I paid 20. I'll keep it for camping."
"My husband bought it and I thought it would be just like any other “non-stick “ pan. They all still stick! This one was REALLY different , IT WORKED!!!!! Nothing ever sticked and he used it everyday for years. One day he noticed a scratch on it and promptly ordered two more. He’ll never go back to using another skillet again!"
"if you remember to cook on 'medium' to 'medium low' this pan works great. Eggs were easy to cook. Omlettes and Steaks cook evenly. and the clean up is amazingly easy. let the pan cool down a little, then grab a wet paper towel and swipe off the stuck-on stuff. If you burned stuff on (turned up the heat a little too much), you'll need a little bit of elbow grease, or soak in water. No soap needed. I got this and the Square griddle/pan and had to return that other one (somehow, the same manufacturer couldn't get the square griddle right) this has made cleanup a breeze."
"I bought a whole set of a deep square pan kit with a glass lid for $77 last year. I consider this Gotham brand the best with nice handles. I didn't scratch it at all, they don't burn, and you can clean it with just soap detergent only. Don't be stupid and use metal utensils but use plastic and wooden spatulas. So I bought this new 9.5"" model because I wanted a shallow frying pan. There is also a 12-inch version. So this one is just as good. As a matter of fact that the non-stick surface is even more slippery than my older one. So stick with these Gotham pans every time."
"Product is great for non-stick cooking. I primarily use it for eggs. It works well but you do you have to be careful with flipping eggs! I know it's a nit-picky detail and I only mention it because I like to show off my over easy egg flipping skills. If you don't use some butter on the bottom the egg will definitely grip (I want to point out I'm saying ""grip"" and not ""stick to"") the surface making it a little tougher to flip.  Other than that I absolutely love this pan."
"Very good and sturdy, but not too heavy. Non-stick material is quite nice and doesn't seem nearly as toxic as typical black material in non-stick pans.  Obviously nice for using metal spatulas etc. which I think is good since I don't like how cheap plastic spatulas shred on the ends over time."
"The first copper skillet I bought was NOT Gotham, and it didn't last long - it actually warped in the middle so it couldn't lie flat on the stove - it actually spun around!  If you want copper, just buy Gotham.....the quality is top-notch and have never had a problem with their pieces."
"Was looking for a nice-sized, reliably non-stick pan to use for one-person meals and this pan was p e r f e c t. It's super easy to clean, even if I accidentally burnt some stuff on it or didn't soak it first. The heat distribution is great-- even though my jank college apartment stovetop is a little unleveled, the pan heats evenly over the flame. Really love this pan!!"
"Bought this egg pan to replace an old Tefal one that had finally given up the ghost and had no more ""non stick"" coatings. Used this new pan for some sausage patties and also for eggs. Both cooked very well on a lower heat and cleaned up with just a wipe from paper towels. After this pan had cooled I gently washed it with mild soap and water."
This pan is absolutely amazing. I've been losing at least half a dozen eggs a week and wasting energy cleaning other pans!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for making my life less difficult and saving me eggs=money as prices go up based on lies!!!
This pan is wonderful you can touch the handle without getting burned and nothing will stick to this pan literally nothing. I only wish I would’ve bought a bigger size it’s not quite as big as I would like but it’s a wonderful pan.
"To preface - this pan is for cooking a single egg, and it’s perfect for that. Great size, easy cleaning, absolutely non-stick. To be honest, I forgot about the “Gotham steel non-stick” thing and was shocked when the butter I put in it beaded up the first time. I love this pan, I love the convenience of the single egg size, and I love how truly non-sticking it is."
"I am absolutely satisfied with the Gotham Steel products I’ve bought. I honestly am. Cook with a bit of butter or oil, keep the heat to about medium, use non metallic utensils and hand wash the item and your meats and veggies will come out fine. Don’t follow this advice and you will become angry and frustrated."
"I love this frying pan! Follow the directions using low-medium heat, a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and my pan still looks brand new. I don’t use any hard scratchy Brillo pad type of material to clean it. Just a dish rag & soap/water and food comes right off. Everything I have cooked doesn’t stick to this pan-eggs, meat, fried rice, gravy...the list goes on. I am very happy with this purchase."
"My favorite pan to use. I was skeptical from the commercials and stuff but at this price point I took the dive. Also, I needed a pan for my foods only since I’m vegan and was tired of having to wash thoroughly after everything my Omni family cooks on the pans. Glad I did. Easy purchase and won’t hesitate to do it again if need be. I do plan on getting a bigger version in the near future."
"This pan is by far the best non stick pan I have owned. I have used it every day to fry eggs cheese and hamburger omelettes, fish, steaks and potatoes using NO COOKING OIL or Butter and NOTHING STICKS!! Food slides right out of the pan just like the TV ads for much more expensive pans. It is so easy to clean and I am very pleased I purchased it."
"I bought the 7.5"" saute pan five months ago. It's used at least ten times per week. It is fabulous. I did season it as per directions and have only hand=washed it. I can put cheese directly on the hot pan and it slides right off when I want it. I do usually use a small amount of butter or oil when cooking, but that is a taste preference. I noticed right away that it seems to get hotter than my other non-stick pans so I usually cook on low, but will cook on medium without burning the food. I recently even burned it by walking away from the pan while it was on the stove and it still performs wonderfully. I am ordering more of these pans."
"I've been putting off buying a red copper type of pan not believing the hype but this pan proved me wrong. As many others have done, I tried a few tests with eggs and cheese and both literally slid right off. This is not a really heavy pan but with proper care I'm sure it will last a long time. I've not put mine in the dishwasher because it's easy to clean with a sponge. If you're on the fence about this pan it's well worth the cost and a great way to try this type of product.."
"This durable, non-stick frying pan is great for everyday cooking! No butter needed to cook your eggs any style. You can also cook your pork chops, sauteed chicken as well with no oil needed. Easy to clean with soap and hot water. Do not put in the dishwasher, or the ceramic coating could become damaged."
I personally hate this pan. My hubby bought them thinking they would be great and he cooks so i figured ok. The metal handle gets hot…not good. The extra smaller handle also gets hot and is horrible when washing and trying to put in the dish drying rack. Food gets stuck by the bolts to the handle. Too much to deal with…do not buy
"Used this for first time last night! Kids made grilled cheeses, they came out perfect. Pan easy to clean afterwards. I bought one of these and a Red Copper pan at same time. They are both very similar in construction. Wish the handle was more substantial!  still very pleased with this product. Made pancakes this AM and did not add a drop of butter, margarine or oil to the pan, and the pancakes came out perfectly! You can really save a lot of calories when you don't add butter to everything you cook!"
I purchased this skillet for my husband so that he would reduce the amount of oil that he uses to fry eggs and sausage. He was reluctant not to use any oil until I showed him how well the skillet works without the added oil. He uses it every morning now without oil and it performs perfectly. Well worth the investment.
"This is a great frying pan and I'm using it a lot. Before I bought it I read the user's reviews. Several people suggested always washing this pan by hand, not in the dishwasher and I totally agree. It's always very easy to clean and I don't want to take a chance on hurting the finish. I've used the pan for fried eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, stir fry, fried chicken, hamburgers, sausage & gravy, and lots of other dishes. Nothing ever sticks! I love it!"
It is an excellent skillet and I really enjoy it. I still use a little olive oil but mainly to have it be easier to clean. Most Teflon coated skillets or other coated ones are ruined from using too much heat. It takes time & patience to learn what the right temperature you should be using! I've been using this skillet for over a month now & it still looks like new. I cook my own breakfast almost every day & I really enjoy having such a quality Skillet.
"Proved to be a really nice pan and every easy to clean. I bought it so that I could practice making sunny size-up eggs. For whatever reason, I was also so challenged and they would not come out right so I decided to try making one in a smaller pan. This pan seems to work just fine and when ready, I can just slide the egg right on out. I am happy!"
Bought the egg pan first. Liked it so much ordered a small frying pan and then got their largest frying pan. Love them all. My fried eggplant comes out perfect every time!
Bought Nov 2019 because of the hype that it was scratch resistant and non stick. First month of using it it was no. Stick. I never use soap on it. I use a gentle brush and a cloth to ensure clean. I always use non abrasive cooking tools. Then food started to stick. Two weeks ago I noticed a “ding” in the surface. Not my doing. The sticking food I guess. Supposed to be guaranteed. Oh well. It is NOT as wonderful as they state
"I’ve been using a ceramic pan since ditching the Teflon but it wasn’t really non stick. This pan is. A fried egg slides right out with no oil or butter. For scrambled egg, my mini wire whip doesn’t scratch it. And the metal handle means it can go in the oven. Love it!"
This is a fantastic pan worth every penny! My husband is the firehouse chef. And really has enjoyed cooking more at home. This is a great little pan to make breakfast in. Egg slide off super easy without any cooking sprays or harmful chemicals. Love love love it! Buy it!
"Works great so far. Not quite as slick as a teflon but pretty close. Its a heavy bottom so it stay level and heats evenly. With the metal handle it can go right to the oven for searing steaks, etc which a plus. I haven't had it long enough to report on how long the coating last but hopefully it last longer than teflon that I have to replace every year +/-."
"I have used this every day for 11 months, sometimes multiple times a day. I have cooked eggs, refried beans, pickles, your mom, and basically everything else. I never used sissy cooking spray as it says not to and I only use good old butter or lard. I have used metal utensils but I stick to plastic. This pan gets a TON of use and has developed battle scars but that could be from fighting off grizzly bears add it didn't say you can't do that in the description. FYI it is recommended to do that as it now has scratches. The non sick has worn away and it is now just a basic pan but is still NOT suitable as a car seat. In the end I liked it so much I'm getting a 2nd one now and the old one will be for my cat."
"This pan is perfect for non-stick when used with real butter. It's my second pan, the first one stopped being non-stick, due to too many micro scratches. I'm super careful with this new one. But if I have to buy a new pan every year, I'm happy to do it."
"I bought a Gotham set a couple of years ago. Love them all. My 8” fry pan was used everyday and was starting to stick slightly when I made crepes. So I picked up another one to be used ONLY for my crepes! We still use the 8” for eggs and meat, just not for something thin like a crepe."
"I used Sensarte 12.5-Inch Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet for a week. I cooked everything in it from eggs, steak, chicken, spaghetti sauce, curry, and found it so easy to clean. I used silicone utensils, no metal and always cook with EVOO olive oil.  The skillets and cookware I've cooked with for 30 yrs are by All-Clad. I also own Le Creuset so, I'm very familiar with quality cookware, how to use and care for it. But I thought it would be fun to have an new non-stick skillet that allows eggs and other foods to cook but to not stick on the surface and provides an easy clean up. One of the selling points of this Brand was the easy to clean quality. I hand washed it every night using dish detergent and paper towels. Let's just say, I babyed this skillet as I do with my expensive cookware.  I would never put this skillet in a dishwasher, that's overkill imo. It's takes 5 min to clean this skillet. After cleaning All Clad every night (esp during Covid) for so many years and now not being able to go out to eat; I needed a break from cleaning by making sure my All Clad looked fabulous.  After a week, putting this skillet thru its paces, I examined the cooking surface. I was disappointed to find small scratches and even a tiny chunk of the 'Swiss Granite"" missing. Had I known this would occur after 1 week, I wouldn't have purchased this skillet. I guess you pay for what you get.  This is from the ILAG GRANITEC website:  ILAG Granitec is a multilayer, ceramic reinforced, scratch-resistant non-stick coating for demanding home use. The granite effect confers a special styling on the coating.  The website says: All coatings are sensitive to scratches and cuts. Small scratches are visible, but do not lead to deterioration in performance.  Those are both on the same Brand page. Both statements from the Brand don't agree. 1 says it's 'scratch resistant' and the 2nd says it's ""sensitive to scratches and cuts'.  Scratches after 1 week is too soon imo. They don't mention that a small piece of the material may fall out.  I recommend before buying, just read all the info from the ILAG GRANITEC website."
"Stumbled on this frying pan, and was interested in the stone coating. I normally use hard anodized pans, but mine have started to wear. I love the look and feel of this pan. The handle is kind of a rubberized wood look, and the pan is pretty heavy with a nice nonstick stone coating. I feel like it gets hotter than my old pans, and heats very evenly. It really doesn't need much, if any, oil/butter for cooking, and so far everything has wiped clean super easily. It looks like it will hold up well, and seems to be scratch resistant. This is the only pan I've cooked with since I got it about 2 weeks ago. I have not used it in the oven, as I really don't use my pans in the oven, but this is only rated to 300F I believe, so something to consider if you use your pans in the oven often.  I think I'll be upgrading all my pans to this type. Deffinitely worth it."
I LOVE this pan. One of the first things I noticed was the matte finish handle. A completely different feel than my Calphalon pans. I have always been a big fan of Calphalon products but this pan surpasses it. Very nonstick. Don’t even have to use oil if you don’t want to. My eggs came out perfect. My Calphalon on started sticking and not being so nonstick so this was definitely a great purchase. It is very solid too. One of the things I like most is the fact that it is super easy to clean and easy to clean around the handle. It’s all one piece. Highly recommend this pan. Even cheese didn’t stick.
"I was looking for a pan to make scrambled eggs the Gordon Ramsey way. I needed a pan that was deep enough to hold at least 6 eggs and a couple tablespoons of butter and allow constant stirring. The previous pans I've tried weren't quite big enough, or the sides were too sloped, and the eggs tended to form a sticky residue on the sides and be very hard to clean off, eggs being the Mt Everest challenge of non stick. This pan fit the bill perfectly shape-wise and this morning, no residue! All the eggs cooked perfectly and slid out of the pan like true non stick should!"
"I ordered this pan back in July. I decided to wait before posting a review. For the money it’s a great little nonstick pan. I don’t buy nonstick cookware due to chemicals in the coating. However, I needed a pan to cook my eggs and cheese in without having to scrape the contents off the bottom. I have been using this pan from four to six times a week. It has held up wonderfully. I use only silicone and wooden utensils in the pan. Just follow the directions for using the pan and it will work great. It still looks like new so far. I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of it and would definitely purchase it again if need be."
"I didn't think I would be leaving a review for a cooking pan, but here we are. I'm a minimalist and I move around a lot, usually to places that already have kitchen supplies. However my current home did not have pots/pans. I was originally searching on Amazon for a decent, affordable pan that I could use for a couple months and then give away to a friend when I moved on to the next place. I bought this pan a little over a month ago, and have used it to cook all 3 meals daily (I'm currently working remotely due to the pandemic and cook most of my meals). It's amazing. I bought 2 other pans and a pot from a home goods store, but I actually use this pan for everything. Nothing sticks to it, it takes just a few seconds to clean, and it cooks food really well. I've used it to make anything from eggs to pasta sauces, meat/seafood, and even soups (the edges are pretty high up). Also, it just looks really nice with the wooden handle. Needless to say I am planning to bring this pan with me to the next places I live in, and it'll probably continue to be the only pan I use."
"I bought it because of the positive reviews. But the quality of this pan is so bad. Only after three weeks, the coating started coming off. Please see the pictures. It became so unsafe to use it anymore, we had to throw it away. We have used other brands, every single of them last for years. We wish the seller could give us an explanation or solutions."
"At this time it’s very non-stick. It’s heavy, thick and seems sturdy. The handle is a soft rubbery feel that looks like wood. It’s attached with screws, so if it loosens it can be tightened. I will update this review in six months.  3 month update: I’m using everyday, sometimes multiple times per day. From eggs to seared steaks, this pan is great! It has yellowed a tad, but still the non-stick surface is 100% functional. The handle is tight & sturdy.  I let the pan cool completely prior to cleaning to avoid abrupt temperature changes, this will prevent warping and may help the non-stick hold up better.  14 months later…used every day. The non-stick has finally lost it ability. The handle has remained tight and as new. No warping. Heat distribution is excellent. I’ll continue to use with no-stick spray. (Last 2 pics are 14 months later)"
"I am using it for last two days. The pan is heavy. It takes some time to heat. But once heated gives heat equally in all areas. Compared to my just retired pan, The thickness is really good. See image for reference. Good nonstick material. However, I do use a little oil spray on my pan. I also like the texture of the handle. Its synthetic wood. Nice one hidden screw in the bottom as connector. I plan to avoid dishwasher while washing. However, i think it will work just fine with the dishwasher."
"We love this pan light weight, easy to clean, and even heat distribution the scratch resistant surface is also great. This is the most used pan of all the ones we own. I highly recommend this pan"
"This skillet is for quick frying, to a lite fluffy dish not a hard fry to sausage or steak or something you want with burnt edges. It is a omelette skillet indeed and I love it. if you use it for a quick dish, nothing will stick and it will flip easy and cook perfectly. if not and you use scratchy forks and harsh utensils it won’t last. With all that said it is the best non stick i have ever had and it is precious to me. I am the only one i’m my home that is allowed to use this perfection cooking tool !!!!"
"This is a good pan and will last as long as you follow the directions given to you.  DO NOT START ON HIGH HEAT, ALWAYS START LOW. DO NOT USE METAL UTENSILS, ALWAYS USE FOID SAFE SILICONE ONES. Always have something like butter/margarine/oil in the pan with whatever you are cooking.  I do not have a proper kitchen so I have to use a hot plate (I use the Elite Gourmet Electric Single Burner). This pan distributes heat pretty evenly and did not scratch even after I cooked multiple things in it in quick succession. One right after the other with no breaks in between. It is easy to clean as well, although I wouldn't put it in a dishwasher because of the wooden handle. Besides, it literally only takes a few minutes to clean if done properly."
"Every kitchen should have at least the Sensarte 10"" or 12"" frying pan. Gone are the days of watching the ""non-stick coating"" peeling away. No danger of it being ingested either! I have a stainless steel fry pan that is part of a very expensive set I bought some 25years ago. It all still looks great, works well too but, I have never been able to cook eggs in the fry pans. Even with oil or butter in the pan, my eggs have always stuck to it. And I'm talking about having to soak the pan in soapy water. Just before I bought this Sansarte pan, I had eggs stuck to the bottom of the pan, and it took 3 days of soaking, and two brillo pads to finally get it off. THAT was the last straw and I started researching new coatings and makeup of pans on the market now and that is when I found these awesome pans. The only thing to keep in mind when using them is not to heat an empty pan. I use a tablespoon or two of Extra Virgin Olive Oil with my pan. My first dish was of course eggs! I fried up first a low sodium honey ham steak until it has a lite crust on both sides. I take it out and put the 6 (scrambled) eggs with seasoning, in next. I let them cook while I cube up the ham steak. Before the eggs set I toss in the ham and mix it in with the eggs. I've cooked eggs in this new pan several times now and not one piece of an egg has ever stuck to it. I wash with hot soapy H2O and a soft cloth and dry it right away. It doesn't go in the cabinet to be stacked with my other pans. I hang this one to avoid any scratches. This is a bargain for such a good high-quality pan, that I highly recommend them, if for nothing other than eggs, like myself, its worth it! Happy Cooking!! ;>)"
"I bought this because my Nu wave & Copper Chef pans were not living up to their non-stick feature as advertised. This pan is perfect. Can actually slide a fried egg out of pan with out any difficulty. Flipped a fried egg yesterday, for the first time in years, that did not have any area stuck to pan. Will be looking to buy more as I use only induction pans now & these seem the best & most reasonably pans I can find."
"Spent a load on 2 different copper sets. Sooo disappointed in the durability and the very short lived non-stick on those. Tried the 5"" skillet in this line and it sold me on them. Not as pretty to look at as copper perhaps, though they are attractively made, but nice and heavy. I treat them as I do my cast iron. Hand wash with minimal or no soap. First couple weeks I heated on low heat to dry and wiped with a bit of oil. Since then I've not done anything but wash them out and hang on the rack to dry. Only use silicone or wooden utensils. Still superior non-stick and no wearing of finish to date. I also have the 8 and 10 inch ones."
"After few week's use, it's lost some of its non-stick but is still adequate considering the hard use I've put it to.  Mostly I use it to toast tortillas. Store bought tortillas can be almost as good as home made, but they require toasting first. Store bought, or home made, requires a fair amount of heat which totally kills most non-stick pans and this one stood up better than some far more expensive pans. (Not as well as cast iron but those take longer to heat and require oil.) For tortillas, I expect the pan to hold up for 6 months or longer.  Following this extreme testing, even eggs seem to still cook well. The surface doesn't take well to oils, so I cook w/o added oil. The pan cleans well even after extended use, but I think the non-stick is going away slightly, but not so much as other more expensive non-stick pans.  Overall, I am pleased so far. I expect, over the next couple months, it'll be more like toasting on ""stone"" pans but I am very pleased so far."
nice medium sized pan for omelets and hotdogs and heating up leftovers. Very nice non stick surface. Handle is comfortable and pan is not to heavy for my somewhat arthritic thumb joint  I bought it because my longtime stick free pan needed to be thrown away as the surface had been scratched up alot. I also had some other pans I used in FLorida...you have to be careful not to cook things with too hot oil in them .....saute but no fryingi really cause you mess the surface up. I'm being careful with this one and remembering to caution my husband about heat levels when he uses it....since he doesn't usually read the instructions for cooking utensils. He made steaks sanwhich meat in it and he got too hot and spattered everywhere.  nice medium sized pan for omelets and hotdogs and heating up leftovers. Very nice non stick surface. Handle is comfortable and pan is not to heavy for my somewhat arthritic thumb joint
"I love this little skillet. I always spray some cooking oil before I use it, and I have had absolutely zero problems with anything sticking, heats evenly, and cleans up super easy. I would definitely recommend and purchase again."
"I am a person who loves to cook, and I have been looking for a nonstick pan. I got this today and started using it immediately. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was absolutely awesome. No sticking, wipes clean, love the handle. Wow. I will be purchasing a couple more in different sizes. Thank you for such a high quality product. I am completely satisfied. G. Guillen"
"Okay, so let me break this down for everyone! I own a stainless steel pots and pan set that was originally purchased for about $300. Well, I like them for certain things, but I was really missing a nonstick pan. I bought this one just so I could quickly have something until I could go out and buy an entire set. Well guess what? This pan is AMAZING. It's literally all I use now. Nothing stick to this thing. Eggs: fried or scrambled, don't stick. Meats, no sticking. I bet I could throw in an entire bag of hard candies, melt them down and they still wouldn't stick. This thing is awesome. She really is that girl. Stunning, well crafted, and I use it all the time. It is also SUPER EASY TO CLEAN, YES GAWD. If I had to find one thing to complain about is that the bottom is a bit too thick, but I don't really mind that since this thing is a dream. Mine didn't come with a lid, but I know that you can buy the lid as well. If you are looking for a new nonstick pan, get this one. I am thrilled."
"I always try to wait a while before writing a review on a product, because isn't everything great at first, and then age wears it down to not-so-great after a short time period? This, I must say, is my favorite non-stick pan I've ever purchased. I've actually been eager to write this review, but wanted to wait and make sure it lasted. I always end up disappointed normally. Non-stick pans never seem to last, they're always great at first. I use them until they get so bad that cleaning them is truly a frustrating experience due to how bad things are sticking, then I replace them.  Thus far, that has not happened with this pan. In fact, this pan is as non-stick now as when I bought it. I literally just cleaned it (eggs were scrambled in it and it was left sitting long enough that the egg residue in the pan had dried). It cleaned so easy. I used the soft side of the sponge, not the bristle side of the sponge...it just wiped right off after months of daily use.  In fact, I have never used the green scrub pad on a sponge on this pan. The product information said that you shouldn't, so my husband and I don't. It comes clean super easily, and it's great to cook in. I don't feel like the non-stick has aged a day. So far, definitely the most impressive non-stick pan I've had.  Second Pro: I love, love, love how deep this skillet is. It's the same size around as your normal 'big' skillet...but it's deeper. Absolutely great for when you're cooking something that requires tossing or a big meal for a group. I suppose the fact that it's deeper than normal should be obvious through the dimensions, but I'll be honest...I've no idea how deep measurement-wise any of my skillets are.  Negatives: The pan heats up slow. I guess that's my biggest complaint. Every other pan I've had, if I put it on the burner with the heat on the same temperature, will be hot faster than this pan. It's been seven months, so I've adjusted to it. And all things said, I'm pretty okay with this being my biggest complaint on the pan.  Notes: My husband and I take care to not use metal utensils on the pan to protect the non-stick, and as I said before we always clean it with just the soft side of the sponge. Which is surprisingly just fine because it works. I was leery of it at first, but it really does come clean that easy, and the non-stick lasts well if you treat it like the directions say to. I was worried my plastic spatula which is a pretty hard/solid plastic would scratch it anyways like it did the other non-stick pans, but it's been fine.  At some point, I'll probably look for this pan in different sizes and replace my smaller non-stick pans too. I never have because the big skillet is the one that gets daily use, while the others get used rarely so aren't as bad as the one we replaced with this."
I don’t use Teflon coated non-stick pans. Instead I have been using cast iron. I bought one of these pans advertised on deal of the day. I was so impressed I bought another size of this pan.  Medium heat and a little oil is all that is required to have a non-stick pan. The eggs or omelette just pour out of the pan onto the plate. I’m impressed !  I use wooden utensils and simply wipe clean with a non abrasive sponge. I can’t speak to the longevity and durability of the costing. But for the price I would just buy a replacement if needed. So far excellent experience with these pans and coating.
"I was reluctant to purchase this pan based on some negative reviews. However, I’ve had it for several months and use it 2-3/week now. It’s so versatile, I look forward to using it because it makes cooking easier. It’s a great looking pan and cleans up well with a soft cloth or paper towel. I only use a silicone spatula or wooden spoon with it so haven’t had any scratches or damage to the non-stick surface.  The pan comes with instructions for proper care. Specifically: Don’t use high heat or over heat it. Start out low and allow the pan to warm up each time. Use a small amount of oil or water even though it is non-stick, this will help keep it clean. Allow it to cool before cleaning, then clean with a warm soapy cloth or paper towel.  The only negative I can see is with the design inside. The center is higher than the sides so you cannot cook something flat like an omelet, evenly. It’s great for sautés and stirfrys or anything being moved around.  Take good care of it and I think you’ll be very happy with your purchase too!"
"I wanted to wait for a while before I reviewed this pan so I could have a chance to use it. This thing is shockingly good - especially at the price point.  You don't need oil AT ALL when you cook in these pans. Eggs scoot right off the surface and I have yet to have anything stick to it. I have to say, I am very impressed with the cooking surface (I use a gas stove). It heats evenly and I really like the angle of the handle. It just seems to make tossing things easier than a handle with a lower gradient.  Love it."
"I have used the pan nearly every day for 6 months and I find that it is a great fry pan with a nice heavy bottom plate that heats evenly and discourages warping (I cannot stand a warped pan). I would recommend this fry pan and plan to buy another of a different size. I am an older lady and have gone through dozens of non-stick fry pans ......they do not last forever folks! The only non-stick pan that lasts FOREVER is the well-seasoned cast-iron frying pans passed down to me from my grandmothers. Yes, this pan will scratch, use plastic utensils. Don't put a hot pan under cold water unless on fire! Just use your noggin and don't do stupid things and it will give you good service for the ""lifetime of the pan"" and no, not YOUR lifetime. BOTTOM LINE: If you need a good non-stick frying pan buy this one."
"I bought two of these pans in different sizes and first put them to work a month ago. I use one of them every single day.  I own very expensive sets of pans of all types but now I pretty much use only these Swiss Granite pans.  The pans come with a short paragraph of instructions. Never turn the heat on under the pan without something in the pan -- fat, your burgers, whatever. Medium heat or lower is best. Never use metal utensils in the pan.  I've done all these things from the start and the pans continue to amaze me. They are absolutely, completely, 100% nonstick, even though I use only 1/4 to 1/2 a tsp of fat for cooking. I've fried potatoes in the pans, made omelets. There is never anything stuck to the pan to soak or scrape to remove. After cooking, I wipe the pan clean with a paper towel.  The heat distribution is great, things brown beautifully."
"I had purchased the smaller saute pan and found it to be so great that I purchased the larger skillet and it's made me happy, happy, happy. The pans are heavy and built very well. The coating is supposedly free of many of the harmful chemicals that the old Teflon pans contained so I feel better about using them. My favorite thing, however, is that they work on induction stoves. Bravo! I can't believe after all of these decades I've found a new product that I'm head-over-heels with!"
"I am in love with this pan. Great size and not as heavy as it seems it would be for the size. Last night I made ground turkey, then hashbrowns then eggs and you couldn't tell I had cooked anything the pan was so clean. Just wiped it out. Heats evenly, love the non stick.....just love this pan!"
Haven't had this non-stick pan long enough to comment on the durability. But the initial reaction is that it works exactly as promised: nothing seems to stick!! Of course most non-stick pans work initially and lose their non-stickiness over time. But I think much of that is due to becoming careless in implementing the instructions that come with the pans and abusing them. I am committed to adhering to the instructions on this one and see how that works out. But I am very happy with the pan so far.
"I shopped around for a reasonably priced non-stick pan and FINALLY found this one. It is AMAZING! I was skeptical because all of these pans ""claim"" to be non-stick and then up being garbage after a few months. Not this one. It was 100% super non-stick and fried eggs literally slid off of the pan with ease. No sticking. No burning. No scraping. For the price (I paid $27.84 total), it was well worth it. I would recommend this pan to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced frying pan that is truly non-stick. 10 out of 10 rating!"
""
"This pan is just as advertised. It really does clean-up easily and quickly; you really do not need much (or any) oil. Cheesy eggs slide right out of the pan. The handle is beautifully crafted, an unexpected bonus. We tossed out all of our Teflon pans for the health reasons, but Teflon never worked this well! We have only had the pan for about a month, so we will see how the longevity of the pan goes, but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Is this pan “healthier” than others? Who knows, but reducing fats from cooking oils, your stress over foods sticking to the bottom of a pan, and the time spent scrubbing other pans is a good healthy start."
"This pan is wonderful, non stick stone-like pan. Requires very little oil, great heat distribution and totally scratch resistant. I love frying fish in this pan. It comes out evenly crisp and thoroughly cooked. Clean up is so easy because nothing sticks or burns!!! It's wash in soapy water, rinse, dry no scrubbing or pre-soaking necessary. I love it. I only wish it came in a larger size!"
"I had been looking at a new pan, as my previous was damaged by with a metal spatula.  It arrived on time, and had a lovely shape. Deeper than my previous pan, it will enable me to warm, poach, pan sear and cook, and do things I would have required another pan to accomplish.  It said to use minimal oil. I tried 1T. It was quite fine, but next time I will try 2t.  I think next time will be tonight, when I sear off some salmon or tuna, and have it with rice and whatever else is appropriate and in the fridge."
"The people writing negative reviews on this product are most likely individuals who just threw away the care instructions for this pan, not taking the time to read how to properly use and care for the pan. They are probably the individuals in school, that during a group project, didn’t follow the instructions and needed lots of assistance. With that being said, I absolutely love this pan as it does its intended purpose. Follow the instructions and you won’t have any sticking. And for the price you pay compared to other pans that are nearly $100, it’s a great deal. Thank you so much."
"This is hands down the best nonstick skillet I've ever owned. I find myself using it several times per day on weekends, and to prepare breakfast every morning. I've given or thrown away every other skillet but my cast iron handed down from my grandmother. It's a good weight, sturdy, cleans easily, cooks perfectly over medium heat, plus it looks classy. One of my most valuable finds on Amazon."
"It was time to let go of my old, egg sticking frying pan. Never heard of granite coating, so I thought it was worthy of a test, especially since many pans are normally twice the price or more. While I've only used it once, it was a breeze to clean, eggs slipped out, and I loved the weight and stability that I feel will give even heating for whatever I cook. I'm intrigued by the handle, and hoping that it may stay cooler than other handles. Well designed and looking forward to a long relationship!"
"I love this Brand and their Non- Stick pans. I use it 3 or 4 times a day being I train competitively of Body Building. I don’t use butter or oils either. And for months, hundreds of uses, and never an issue with sticking. I also hand clean it each time, no harsh detergents. Yes over time it starts sticking. But I’ve used it 100’s of times with no issues. If you do use oils, I would thing it would last years."
"I've been cooking for close to 60 years now and this is the best pan I've ever used - and I use it every day. It's so good that I bought another just like it to put away in case I ever need a replacement and I can't find another, and I also bought the larger size. It not only works just as described, but it looks as good as it performs. This pan would be a bargain at twice the price, so at this price it's a steal. You will not be disappointed."
"I was bored and waiting for my wife to finish something, so actually read the instructions. They were fairly generic, but told my why none of my previous non-stick pans ever lasted.  DO NOT heat the pan on high, and DO NOT heat it empty. Heat the pan up on medium or low with something in it, even if it's just a little oil. We that now and three months later this pan is as good as when we bought it. It's still so slippery that sometimes it's hard to get the spatula under the food to flip it."
"I’ve been disappointed in making eggs for years. Having yolk to dip my toast only happened when I visited my neighborhood restaurant. Then I bought this pan. Lo and behold, after following the directions on how to use, I have been able to cook my eggs just the way I like them. Clean up is a snap! I can’t remember when I last cooked eggs that would slide around the pan. Great pan!! I’m glad I decided to try."
"This is easily the best frying pan I've had. It's well made and comfortable to hold. I just wipe it with a paper towel and lightly go over it with a soapy dishcloth. Rinse, dry and put away. It's slightly smaller than my others, which is one reason I got this size. It doesn't come with a cover, but I have some that fit. I will definitely add more of these to my stash, while replacing my old ones. Highly recommend!!"
I've been using this for a few weeks now on a ceramic stove top starting it at 2 with olive oil once warm moving up to 4. Zero issues with the coating. Only silicone or wood utensils used with it. I can still wipe it clean with a paper towel after cooking and nothing sticks. After its completley cooled I wash it with water and a drop of soap on a paper towel. I love this pan 😍
"I have been looking for a great pan to fry eggs in, and I'm beyond happy with this pan. It is super easy to clean and cooks evenly on my gas range. I was initially thinking I was over paying at nearly $20 for this little pan, but I promise it is worth twice that. We cook everything in it, and I am buying some larger pans to match. I really, really love this pan."
"First and foremost it’s a great pan. If you’re evaluating any frying pan, heat distribution and it’s nonstick features are the top priority. However, what really separates this from others is the lack of rivets on the inside for the handle. It makes cleanup so much easier. You don’t have things that stick to the stainless surface of an otherwise nonstick frying pan. Absolutely love it and I have given this as gifts."
"Bought this pan couple month ago. So far I like it. I can almost skip oil to fry eggs. The handle doesn’t get hot, which is very user friendly. Non stick is excellent. I have been very careful not to use any metal or hard spatulas. So I can not command about its scratch resistant character since I haven’t used it often, time will tell.  Yes, I recommend this frying pan."
I love this skillet! The nonstick feature is amazing and I mean nothing sticks to this! It’s incredibly easy to clean. I just rinse out with really hot water and then wipe dry with a paper towel. I love this pan so much I’m going to buy the 12.5 inch skillet!!
"I've had this pan for a couple weeks now and use it multiple times a day. So far it's performing great! It's a great quality, heavy pan with a comfortable, easy grip handle. Nothing sticks so it's super easy to clean with a soft rag. I would definitely recommend this pan."
"This is a good skillet, I've had it for awhile now and I have no complaints, if you take reasonable care of it, it will last, and when cooking an egg, it will slide around and not stick.. I'm going to buy a couple more of them soon, just take care of it, I mean don't be beating it with a hammer like those nuts on TV or use a metal fork or spoon on it and it will be fine, they are worth the money.."
"I've only had the pan a few days, so although I don't know about long term durability my initial results are great! So far, it seems to be an amazing value that offers even heating, nice feel/handle, and nothing has stuck to it (so far). Just wipe it clean with a damp towel after cooking and you're done. Way better performance than the Calphalon I was using, and this one is half the price. If the coating holds up, this will be the best value frying pan I've found."
"Feels about perfect weight. Not flimsy, not cast iron heavy. Appreciate no inside pan rivets so smooth swipes to clean. Really, once cooled just gentle swipe of soapy sponge and clean. Handle feels comfortable and so far, not been hot. Vegetarian me rarely uses heat beyond medium so can't attest to high heat performance of handle or pan. Also don't need to place in oven so no comment about oven functional or not. Rate this pan 10 for my needs though durability remains a question only to be answered over time. Gave three-star rating on scratch resistant only because don't yet know!"
"I bought this specifically for cooking eggs and omelets, but I liked it so much that I've been cooking everything in it. The best thing about this pan is how easy it is to clean. I just wiped out spaghetti sauce with a regular paper towel. Nothing stuck. Obviously I still washed it with soap but it there was zero scrubbing. If any happens to my pan I'd definitely buy another one"
"For long time I was looking for granite pan and thought to try this one. I used this granite non stick multiple times in last two days and i think the Non stick works great with eggs and omelets.(Haven’t try other food on it yet).It uses very less oil to cook eggs. With my other pans butter and oil always stuck with the pan. But This is not at all with this pan.Nothing sticks to it.It is very easy to clean.There is no lid with it but still i like it. Pan is little bit heavy ( if you are looking for lightweight).The handle looks like wood( but actually its not wood) but i like the way it is. The handle is soft and easy to grip. Its a good looking pan. Shipping and Packaging was good.Its worth the price. If you are looking for a small & balanced pan, I recommend this one."
"We needed a nonstick skillet, and one that didn't require the handle to be assembled. This is exactly what we wanted. It is easy to clean, works perfectly as a skillet, and has a very sturdy handle. We are very pleased with this product."
"Bought these as a gift. I already have them and love them. Food slides out with very little oil...a single spray of olive oil. Super easy to clean. I would recommend that you only use wood, bamboo or plastic in these. Mine haven't scratched, but I haven't used metal spoons, whisks, etc. It's a good quality product that I would gift again."
"Works as advertised, nothing sticks. I don't believe it's a stone surface, based on my research it's ceramic. However, it does work and it's not teflon! It's deep enough to make a pasta or potato dish, as well as delicious fish or meat dish over high heat. We love the handle which is wood and not plastic or metal. So definitely something I can recommend based on my families experience."
Got this little pan for my super small bariatric cooking needs. Perfect for a couple of eggs or an omelet or small stir fry. Super slick surface does need an initial coat of butter or oil according to the package insert. But cleans up.perfectly with little to no residue in the pan. Love the handle. Easy to use. I do not know if it will be scratch resistant or not so just using my none metal spatula and spoons in it.
"I got my mom one of these pans a year ago and she loved it and asked for another for mother's day. Then she ordered another. Then she bought my grandma a couple, who also loved them. Then my grandma got me one. So we are all cooking in the sensarte pans and loving them. I hand wash mine but my grandma uses the dishwasher. The nonstick coating is awesome."
"I bought this pan to replace a different nonstick pan that had failed. So far, this pan has lived up to all expectations. It cooks well and cleans without any problem - just using a soft dish cloth. We did read and follow the instructions. The rubberized handle is very nice. I recommend this pan very highly."
"I'm writing this review because I am impressed with how easy it is to clean. I've only had it 5 days and I've used it daily.. Every time I clean it , I can do it with just 1 paper towel. Eggs , sauces , vegetables , all clean with just one paper towel. Nothing sticks , easy to clean , and the price is right. What else can I say ?"
"Been using daily for months now, hand washing, dishwasher, frying, burning, scrubbing, you name it, this skillet keeps on going like day one. Not one complaint. Wood handle obviously does not get hot which is amazing because i always forget on other skillets and burn my fingertips. Best money spent!!"
"I purchased a small Sensarte skillet at the end of 2020. So, after using it for more than a year now, I feel I can say it is a good little non stick skillet. I recently purchased a larger one (even came with a glass lid) and have used it twice now. It's just as good as the little one! Recommend highly!"
I’ve used this every day since i got it to make my eggs. Im yet have to scrub this pan it’s amazing. I will say it definitely gets hotter than my last Teflon pan i was using. I found i had to turn the burner down slightly to slow down the cooking. Not a bad thing just wanted to share so you can time your eggs with the rest of the breakfast foods
"Best non-stick pan I have owned! We also take care of it - we wait until it has cooled off to wash it, never put it in the dishwasher, we wash it with a paper towel and dish soap, never use metal or utensils that would scratch it. We’ve never had food that has stuck that didn’t come off with a paper towel. I regularly cook chicken, bacon, eggs, grilled cheese, pancakes, they cook perfect!"
This is quite a large pan (See my photo) I am very pleased with this pan and glad that can be used on an induction cooktop (which I have on order). Easy to clean too. I may order a smaller one as well.
"Bought these for my teenaged son who thinks he knows how to cook scrambled eggs. I was tired of soaking and scraping skillets full of burned egg, cheese and hot sauce so I bought these. They just wipe off clean with a dry paper towel! I’m 60 and these are by far the best skillets I’ve ever used. Hid my other ones. Hmmm...now I want to look at their pots...."
"I love this pan for my variety of heavy cooking.  Pros: 1. It has a long handle, so you easily toss the food to perfection. Also, the long handle keeps the heat away and provides great handling. 2. Even the pan is large enough to cook lunch for 2 ppl, it heats evenly across its wide bottom so that food cooks properly. 3. Heavy India dishes need good oil, but since this pan has a great non-stick coating, whatever the deep-fried dish I cook, it does stick to the pan - Excellent Non-stick coating. 4. Easy to clean.  Cons: 1. It would be great if it has a lid added. 2. The wooden handle adds a little more weight to handle the pan. But it gives a stylish look and feel."
"I switched over to using just cast iron pans a few years ago but in the age of COVID and having a teen age son at home who likes to cook eggs while distance learning, I thought this pan might work out well for him. I bought the 11 inch pan which is both heavier and deeper than I thought it would be. The pan so far is completely non stick (we use butter/oil when frying). No signs of scratches yet and the handle sturdy and not too thin like a lot of pans. Clean up is easy and honestly, the pan looks good when it sits out."
Best skillet I’ve ever owned. Without a doubt. I like to use cast iron but frequently prefer non-stick and this one is superb. I’ve been through a lot of the common brands before but none as well made and impressive as this one. Nice to find quality at a fair price nowadays.
Super easy to cook with. Don’t even have to use any utensils to slide the scrambled eggs out of the pan. Cleans so easy - used my index finger it was so easy- no water even used. Great price and packaged with care and very well - especially compared to another non- stick pan I had to return recently. 5 stars for sure ! !
"I know from experience that you have to replace your non-stick pans every coupla-few years, because they lose their non-stick quality with use. So, you can either go all-out and get the most expensive non-stick pans on the market, or get a good value for your money. This is a good value for your money.  Despite the non-stick surface, you really need to use some kind of fat to have these pans (and any non-stick pans, really) truly be non-stick. Butter is good if you want that flavor (especially with eggs), as is any high smokepoint oil (I prefer grapeseed oil).  Out of the box, I tested this pan with an egg and no fat on the pan (after washing with warm water, soap, and a sponge). It was almost non-stick, but not quite. Which is what I expected.  If you want your non-stick pans to last: - Do not sear anything (on high heat) - Do not put them into the dishwasher (despite the claim that they're dishwasher-safe) - anything you put in the dishwasher, you're basically sandblasting - Wash with hot water, dishwashing soap, and a sponge (no scrubby pads or dish brushes) - Never use non-stick cooking spray. They contain lecithin, which builds up into a brown goo that you can't remove without destroying the cooking surface. - Only use nylon or silicone utensils (you can make a heck of an omelet with a silicone spatula) - Do not stack them without some kind of protection on the cooking surface (newspaper?). I hang all of my pans on a pot rack, which is preferable.  Follow these rules, and you should get at least a couple of good years use (maybe more) out of your pans. But, plan on buying new ones in a coupla-few years. If you want to cook on high heat and/or sear stuff, consider a good stainless (All-Clad?) or cast iron (Lodge?) pan. Just don't torture your non-stick pans. It's not what they're made for."
"I purchased this pan for the first time about a year ago. The quality of the pan is great, especially since we don’t handle it with extra care (we use metal fork etc.). However, as other review mentions its base is not wide enough so it is not stable on our range. But it is my husband’s fav pan, so when time came to replace an older frying pan, I purchased this pan again. This time can a pan white a wider base, and it no longer wobble on the range. I was so pleased that OXO fixed the design problem, so I bought another one, thinking to replace the older model, that is basically a fire hazard. Unfortunately this time came the smaller base pan again, so I sent it back. I did notice that at the bottom of the pan there is a model number, and it was different. It was 4198 for the older model and 6198 for the improved model. The actual base is about 0.5” wider, which is a big difference. If the pan doesn’t wobble on your range, then it’s a solid pan that would last. I just wish I could buy another pan from the wider (newer?) model."
"I read the reviews that mentioned the problem of the pan tipping when empty because the handle was too heavy, and another review that stated that the design problem had been rectified. I like the other pans I have in this line and wanted the smaller one, so I contacted the seller, Chefs Corner Store to inquire about the pan. I got a fast response, with the seller having opened the packaging on a pan to test it for tipping. Since the report was that the pan does not tip, I went ahead and placed the order. The pan is great! I live alone, so cooking up an egg or two, or whipping up a bit of stir-fry is just right in this 8"" pan. Super easy clean-up, too - just wipe it out. Even cheese doesn't stick to it. Highly recommend the pan and the seller!"
"This is the first truly non-stick pan that I've owned. The blue pan and the copper pan have all lost their non-stick coating. Here's the rub - In order to keep this pan from sticking, 1. Do not stack it underneath other pans 2. Wait until it cools before washing or it will warp. Also, do not use abrasive pads or cleaners. 3. Use rubber utensils not metal. 4. Salt food after you place it off the skillet or it might scratch. If you follow this advice, your pan will keep its non-stick coating indefinitely. I've had mine for months and it still looks brand new."
"I've never owned a non-stick pot or pan because of all the warnings. But, lately especially, some of the recipes I want to make specifically indicate using a non-stick pan. I have a 6"" pan which is good for making a couple eggs but can't handle anything more. I have a 10"" pan too but that's often too big. So I needed an inbetween so got this one. It really is non-stick (surprise!) which is really nice. I am following the recommendations on the little paper that came with it so I hope it'll be nice to me for a long time. I don't want to get any other non-stick pots or pan but this one is a good one. It does have a way of tipping off the burner grill when empty since the handle weighs more than the pan) but other than that it seems perfect. Oxo, fix the handle! You could have put a hollow core handle on there and it would be a near perfect pan for just basic home cooks.  01-2020 update--have been using this now for a month or so and find the tip factor horrible and am now looking for some other non-stick teflon pan. I don't need piping hot juices or oils spilling all over the place, not to even mention the chance of fire. This is just an unacceptable pan just because they didn't balance the handle with the rest of the pan."
"At last, a square griddle pan with some substance to it. Someone had a conscious thought when they designed this pan. I have run through SO many of these, and have had to throw away most as soon as they begin to warp. I always seem to wind up in an apartment that has a glass top stove (grrrrr, HATE them) but this pan works beautifully with it. It is weighty, but not such that you can't lift it. It feels substantial in the hand, and lays perfectly flat on that cursed glass top. If you (and this is key) FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, you'll have this pan a long time. Use low to medium heat, as the heat is conducted quickly and evenly. Do NOT put it in the dishwasher--there's no need to. A quick swish with hot soapy water does the job. If you're scraping food off this, your heat is too high. The price for this is quite reasonable, especially since I've paid for it six times over at least with cheap ones (which were the only ones I could find at the time). I love this for sandwiches, searing steaks, French toast, eggs, pancakes, etc.. This is 11"" square, so 4 pieces of regular sandwich bread will fit nicely here, and clean up is a breeze. LOVE IT!"
"My dad loves to cook, and he also loves to research all of his cooking tools before buying them. I got him this because he mentioned he needed a new non-stick pan for eggs. Cook's Country recommended the OXO pans. He likes the metal handles, so I got him the Pro version. He also generally only needs the 10 inch pan, so I went with it over the 12 inch. He loves it!! Says it is the best pan he has ever had. He really like the angle of the edges. It is a pretty steep side, almost like a corner, and it makes the bottom of the pan a lot flatter than pans that have an easy slope on the side. He says it gives him more room to work. I may purchase one for myself!"
"The pan performs well, however the non-stick surface is flaking off after less than a year’s use employing proper utensils. We expected better."
"Update:4/20 - Still no wear and I use I nearly daily...I like my eggs :) Also, never stack any non-stick pan; hang it on a hook as I can or protect the finish by putting it in a ziplock before nesting pans. Normally I wouldn't have expected this priced pan to last more than three months. With my normal routine, I can see this finish lasting more than a year. Amazing!  Great nonstick finish at a good price. I never use soap on my nonstick pans, just very hot water and a wipe out with a paper towel. Super easy cleanup, no sticking, better than expensive name brands all-clad. I have many all-clad pans, mostly Stainless as it just doesn't pay for a nontick pan...even with the care as outlined above, the finish will erode over time. So just get this oxo and when it finally does erode, just replace it. I haven't seen any wear yet on this pan and I use it often. Pleasantly surprised...."
"This item was very highly rated in a leading cooking magazine. One of its admirable qualities in the review was that the bonding of nonstick surface to base material was not going to delaminate. And sure enough, it was wonderful to cook in it. We were careful never to subject it to high heat, and we took good care of it.  About 1 year later, bubbles appeared on the cooking surface. And then the bubbles scraped off. It's now useless. We wrote to OXO to ask about their 10-year warranty and have had no reply. If we ever hear from them, I will revise this review."
"This has great heat distribution, and has kept the coating well. We have the 10"" and liked it so much that we got the 12"".  I cook on a very hot stove (16k BTU, but to be honest, I tend to have it on low or low-mid). It has only warped a little, and I just rotate it a tad to get it to lay flat. I've gotten the same mileage on the all-clad staneless and and Calphalon William Sanoma Elite Nonstick (I recommend both)  I only use wood, nylon, or oxo silicone spatulas. So I can't speak for what happens if you use a metal utensil.  Note about Calphalon - I only recommend the Elite - as the lower versions lost their coating quite quickly for me. OXO is much better than the T-fal series but comperable in price. T-fal lasted about 6 months before loosing the coating."
"Please do not buy this griddle, its extremely poorly made. Just got this OXO griddle delivered to me on Dec 05. With less than 10 days of use the griddle has already warped with ordinary use, that it is now unusable. Hugely disappointed at the OXO quality of this griddle. Not worth the money, only used 4 -5 times and it warped."
"This would be a five-star review if the nonstick finish hadn't degraded so quickly. The handle and weight are nice, the exterior finish is great. The only problem is the cooking surface. We have lots of nonstick skillets and treat them all the same way: no metal utensils, hand-wash only. This one has started flaking much more quickly than the other brands. It's already time to replace this one, and we certainly won't be buying another of this model."
"After one year of use the coating has holes in some places. Also it had dimples on the pan. When I reached out to Oxo customer support (initially about the dimpling) they claimed that it was carbonization on the pan. I followed their cleaning directions and it made it slightly better but still had a lot of ""carbonization"" on it.  About a month after first contacting Oxo customer support I noticed that there is now a hole in the coating. They stated that it isn't a hole but burnt oil. I have attached a photo here showing the hole and disagree that it is burnt oil.  As a note I never use any metal utensils in the pan. I use a Matfer Pelton Spatula and an old silicon spatula (with plastic handle) in it. Along with OXO Tongs with Nylon Heads. Also we only use butter, olive oil, or avocado oil. We have never used any spray oils, as have read that they are bad for non-stick pans."
"Great value. Received the pan. It is everything I expected and more. I would even compare this to some of the high dollar pans I have had. (Mother-in-law lived with us for a short time, warped my high-end flat pan and destroyed our other cookware) this pan, like all pans, you have to find out how it cooks. Do not set this pan on high heat like u did with your old one you WILL warp it. I recommend starting out on low heat, and cooking an omelet watching the heat signature of the pan. My old pan I could cook at a number 4 heat setting. (We have a gas stove) with this pan I am cooking at a 2 1/2 - 3 heat setting. It makes the best omelets and pancakes. Clean up is a snap. Pan must be cool before cleaning. Cleans with a paper towel. Pan works wonders without using non-stick sprays like PAM, butter, margarine or oils. I expect to use this pan for a long time. Great product."
"We are now on our second pan as the first one was scratched to the heavens the first night it arrived. We literally used it just to heat a couple corn tortillas and all we did was place them in the pan on one side for about 30-45 seconds then flipped to the other side and did the same. In sliding these around the pan GENTLY, mind you, when we removed the tortillas low and behold there were scratches all over the surface. At first we couldn't believe our eyes and said there's no way, so we waited for the pan to cool to room temp and proceeded to wash it with a NON-Abrasive sponge but to our dismay those wretched scratches were still there. Definitely not a nice sight after ONE use and seeing as how we paid almost $50.00 for this pan!! So we returned this as defective because we believe we did nothing wrong. We didn't even use a utensil, we flipped them by hand.  Well the return was accepted and we opted for a replacement of the same pan thinking this was a fluke and maybe something was just wrong with THAT pan. We received our replacement about a week later and we used it to cook eggs, etc. and everything was great UNTIL over the weekend we used it to cook pupusas. Now mind you, pupusas are made with a SOFT masa dough. All we did was heat a little oil in the pan and cooked them on each side until crispy on the outside but still nowhere near what you would think it would take to SCRATCH a pan. Unbelievable. We removed the food when it was done and you guessed it, scratches galore. This time deeper, you could feel the ridge with your finger when you ran it over the scratch and also the finish (non-stick coating) was already coming off in the middle. Ya'll this pan was only ever heated to medium and not ever used on high heat. It just wasn't needed as medium did the job pretty well and honestly that's the setting we use mostly as in learning about proper cooking we found out it can warp some pans, etc. if it is heated too high.  Overall we are sending this second pan back as well, this time for a full refund. We are highly disappointed in this OXO Pan and will GLADLY be taking our money elsewhere. Such a shame because when the pan arrives it is so beautifully packaged and the shine and shimmer on that pan is so elegant and when you look at it, it looks like a nice professional pan, but how is this worth anything when you have to fear it scratching like this?!? I could understand if we were using metal utensils/trying to cook something rough but never expected the turnout we had. Hope this helps others and best of luck if you buy this pan. Apparently it's particular on what you can and can't cook in it."
"I saw this pan reviewed on America’s Test Kitchen, which is my go-to for all of my kitchen equipment. I’ve never had anything fall short of excellent from them; They test for everything! So I was very curious to see if this pan indeed did not balance when I got it, As some reviews have stated. Attached are three pictures. My cooktop is often very unstable because of the design of all the prongs. I move this around all over the cooktop, and it did not tip over once. I knew that America’s test kitchen test for things like this… Ease-of-use, balance, so I am not sure if somebody reviewed the wrong pan? This is a winner! I love that it is dishwasher safe and I love that the rivets are coated on the inside! I will update the review after I use it a lot more… But it does not tip on top of the stove!"
"Non stick has come a long way. I have 3 sizes of these. the are good for heating, clean out easily, I use a paper towel soon after cooking for visible stuff and wash later, and last for a long time. And they are a great price. Cook's Magazine said a few years ago, ""Don't buy expensive non-stick, just use and throw out in a year or 2. Not bad but these last and are worth the low price."
"I knew when I purchased this pan that it did not come with a lid. I did not realize that standard 10"" lids will not fit the pan. I have a lid from a previous 10"" frypan (not Oxo) that has fit multiple pans from multiple manufacturers. I was very disappointed to find that it does not fit the Oxo pan. Once I discovered that I searched the reviews and Q&A for ""lid"" and saw the complaints about lids not fitting. It never occurred to me that a pan from a major manufacturer like Oxo would not accept a standard lid so I did not check that before purchase. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"OXO has such a good reputation that I thought I would get their griddle. In spite of good care and handling, this griddle has warped and no longer fits on the stove well enough to cook anything. Owned less than a year. I sent OXO a letter three months ago and heard nothing.  Not recommended."
"Two yrs. ago, I purchased the 10-inch Oxo Pro pan. Today, it still looks and performs like brand new. I use it every day. Now, I purchased the same pan but smaller 8-inch. The Oxo Pro pans have a lifetime warranty. They will last a very long time if you don't use citrus-based soaps or products to clean them. It slowly eats away the non-stick coating. I found a cover lid for my 10-inch pan and another one for my 8-inch pan. Both lids are sold on Amazon. They are made of glass and silicone with a little metal ring surrounding the steam hole. The knob/handle on the smaller lid is silicone too. It looks like it was made for my Oxo pan. I'm very pleased with the high-quality details, performance, and maintenance of both Oxo pans and universal lids. I would happily buy them all again. Here's the Amazon link for the small glass lid in size ""6-7-8"":  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYF4WQW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1  Please note: The tiny white lines on the cover lid is dust. There are no defects or faults in the lid or pan itself. I didn't know the new iPhones will capture that much detail. Now I have to vacuum before taking photos too."
"I love these Oxo skillets. Like everything Oxo in the kitchen, they are well designed, comfortable, and perform very well. I keep them beside the Matfer carbon steel skillets for tasks that for which I am not confident enough to subject any nonstick pat. I also will remain careful enough to still not subject them to a dishwasher. Why take chances? But they are a breeze to clean, as nothing has remained stuck! Food glides around on the pan while cooking and it comes off after I am finished. My only complaint is they don't have lids available. No problem, though, because lids for my other skillets fit fine. Price was fine for all three pans. I gulped when I saw Amazon had raised the cost on the 12-inch skillet from $40 to over $90, but I jumped for joy when it came down again to $40. The skillets are very well constructed and designed. I appreciate the clever lip on the edge that is effective at reducing spills when I pour food from the pan. Oxo came through for me again. (I am not receiving any compensation from Oxo or Amazon. I am expressing my personal experience and enthusiasm.)"
"As with all nonstick cookware, I was extremely skeptical of the claims about this pan, but it really does deliver, unlike the dozen others I've tried over the past few years. I use a small amount of cooking oil in it most of the time, but I have found that doing so is not strictly necessary, even with naturally sticky foods like eggs. Preheated to an appropriate medium-to-medium-high temp, you can crack an egg into the pan and then flip it with ease, and *that* my friends is truly remarkable. I've tried other types of nonstick pans that make that claim and they have all failed. This is literally the first nonstick pan I've ever owned that is actually nonstick. And, it still accepts and distributes cooking oil evenly. Strongly recommended!  Two additional notes related to this pan: 1) I initially was using plastic-silicon turners/spatulas, one of which had become hard and brittle (eventually breaking). It did seem to leave superficial marks on the surface of the pan, but the pan still seems to perform just as well as new. I eventually replaced the old spatula with an OXO silicon spatula (small size is perfect for this pan) and that's been an awesome fit. 2) Cleaning is a breeze. Most nonstick pans will suggest not washing their pans with soap unless you're going a long time between uses. I have found that this pan actually performs better when you use a little soap to clean it up. ymmv."
"2019 update- the sides are starting to get a little sticky. No warping at all. Can't believe this pan has lasted 2 years with my regular use. Will purchase another soon.  Love love this pan. It has not warped or changed shape. I use it alot. My Tfal lasted a few weeks before it started warping and lost some of it's non stick properties. Not this sturdy guy, it looks brand new 4 months later. Don't hesitate, buy this pan."
"After several weeks of use I find this OXO pan to be superior to 4 other square griddle brands I tried. There has been no problems with anything sticking and so far there has been no signs of warping that has happened with the others. Possibly, because this is a much heavier pan. I am being extra careful with this pan by not using extreme heat and not washing a hot pan in cold water, which could cause warping. I recommend this and would purchase the same pan again without hesitation."
"After reading the reviews on this frying pan, I was concerned about the handle being 'too heavy' which may cause the pan to 'tip over'. However, since I'm usually very happy with the quality of other OXO products I've ordered, I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. This is an excellent frying pan! The sides are high, which prevents food from spilling over the edges and increases the interior capacity. The non-stick feature is great and it's easy to clean. Surprisingly, because of the depth of the frying pan, it seems larger than its size. Best of all, there was absolutely NO TIPPING OVER. Perhaps OXO improved this product, but the frying pan I received is perfect for our needs. Overall, once again, OXO products continue to be reliably consistent in their excellent quality. As far as durability, only time will tell."
"The 8 inch skillet is unusable as designed. Handle too heavy for the skillet. Tips over when resting on stove eye. Center of gravity on the 10 inch and 12 inch skillet more balanced. You won't have the same problem with the larger skillets. Also the cooking surface on the 8 inch pan is slightly more than 5.5 inches, enough for 1 egg, maybe 2. Overall nice pans if you omit the 8 inch size and stick with the larger sizes."
"It is truly sad that as a professional chef of over forty years, my pans at home were very old, in abysmal condition and of poor quality. Even sadder, they had seen very little usage over the course of the last 25 years. After loudly voicing my opinion on the piece of cookware I was using, my wife said why don't you just buy another pan. I was expecting to return this pan but I was pleasantly surprised! It has the right heft and feels solid. It is not heavy and clunky nor does it seem cheap and tinny both are issues I constantly see in cookware for the home. The handle is the right length and fits well in the hand. Even more more important the inside edge of pan is right height and roll for flipping food! I can flip an over easy egg with a flick of the wrist. Most of the pans I see are too square or too short. I can also go from stove top to oven in this same pan and that is like icing on the cake. I liked this pan so much I purchased a 10"" one as well. Kudos to OXO! Now can we talk about a lid to fit??"
"I use this quite a bit -- it is my go-to sear and sauté pan. I often will sear fish or chicken on stovetop and finish it in the oven. I will also use this in place of the wok due to ease of size. It heats up/cools down quickly so I find it easy to control the temperature when cooking. I bought this a little over a year ago (August 2020) and it is still going strong. I use a ceramic cook-top. It was recommended by America's test kitchen. My daughter is shopping for a pan. When I sent her this recommendation I noticed a few reviews that did not like the pan so I just thought I would share my experience. Not sure it would do well over a flame, but over the ceramic it is great! I have an expensive set of thick copper bottom pans, and this is the one I reach for the most. Just make sure you remember to grab that pot holder when taking it out of the oven!!!"
"I had previously bought a cheap griddle pan from Amazon (one of those copper colored things) that warped badly after only a couple of uses making pancakes. Frankly, I'd bought it as an experiment to see if a super cheap pan would be OK. Well, now I know that it is possible to go too cheap :-)  After a considerable amount of research, and reading reviews on pans at every price point, I decided to go with this OXO pan. By and large, the reviews on this pan are favorable, and of course OXO is a well known brand, so I pulled the trigger and bought one.  As soon as I unboxed it, I compared this pan to my old, warped one. The OXO is a good 3mm thicker than the old pan, and its handle is nicer to hold and feels securely attached to the base. We have used it several times, and so far there are no signs of warping. The non-stick coating works as claimed and is easy to clean.  I'm happy with my OXO pan and think you will be, too. It's a solid pan at a good price. As long as you don't abuse it (avoid high heat, use silicone utensils, and DO NOT USE COOKING SPRAY) it should last a long time."
Purchased in December 2019. Never left the pan unattended or used on a high flame. The nonstick coating is great but the bottom of the pan is melting away. I've been buying cookware for 50 years and have never seen this happen.  I contacted OXO through their online claim form and got an immediate reply with a reference number. The reply said they would contact me within 24 hours. That was two weeks ago. I called their toll free number but hung up after 30 minutes on hold. Amazon has not replied to my request for assistance.
I bought this because America's Test Kitchen said that it was the best one. But after only a few uses and with no scraping of the pan with any metal utensil the surface of the skillet looks as if has been in service for 5 years. That is not acceptable. That cannot be the best skillet! There is no way...
"I've bought several nonstick skillets over the past ten years, including All-Clad. They usually work reasonably well for a few weeks and then begin to lose some of their nonstick quality. Even using plastic, wood or nylon utensils seems to scratch them some and finally after a year or more, they become ineffective, although still usable. After looking at a superlative recommendation on a cooking website, I bought this pan. It was a little more expensive than Farberware and other decent quality pans, but I figured I'd chance that it might pay off. Did it ever! Have been using it regularly for two months now and it is as slippery as day one. It's almost annoying how slippery it is as I have trouble flipping eggs in the morning-can't get under them without pushing them around. Anyway, it cleans easily with a soapy sponge, the surface has held up well and it is STILL nonstick. Will update over time, but so far, I'm loving this pan like no other. I'm a car guy, not a cook, so for me to get this excited over a frying pan is not normal. I just appreciate the quality and function of a GREAT product!"
"I really like this pan. I love to cook and good quality tools are important to me. This pan is lightweight and feels nicely balanced. I chose the Pro version for the slightly higher oven temp range in case I need to finish a dish there. Large cooking surface. Super easy clean up. I haven't put it in the dishwasher, but nice to know I can. I found a stray, glass Calphalon lid in a thrift store that fits it perfectly. I'll be buying a 10"" pan, soon!  November Update: I've been cooking with this pan almost daily since August and I still love it. It heats quickly and evenly and cleans up beautifully. Great pan for the price!"
"Over the years I've learned don't expect to keep a non-stick skillet for more than a couple of years. So I never spend the huge amounts that some brands will charge you. I was happy when a very dependable source, Cook's Illustrated, gave it their top recommendation and it has turned out every bit as good as they said it would and it is inexpensive enough that I will not grumble when I replace it in a couple of years."
"I am one of those folks who always check America's Test Kitchen's reviews before I buy anything for my kitchen. OXO has been the highest-rated recommendation for a few years now. It displace T-Fal, which was another favorite of mine. Why is the OXO version better? First off, it's heavier, more substantial. That means it doesn't warp. A key feature for glass top stoves. Secondly, because it has a steel handle, it can go into the oven to finish cooking. An earlier version had a plastic handle that could only go to 325° - not helpful in most cases. I'm a fan of all the OXO gadgets. Now I can add their cookware basics!"
"This thing is slick in its appearance and cooking surface. I'm using a lot less oil in this pan than I would in others. Less oil in the pan means less extra calories in your food (healthy)! Passes the egg test with flying colors! Also very easy to clean. The handle is cool to the touch when cooking on the stove top and is a joy to hold because of its shape. I haven't put it in the oven yet but I'm sure it works great in there and I would use a oven mitt when pulling the pan out of the oven. I use a Misen stainless steel pan for searing and oven cooking (handles high heat safely), just seared then baked a pork loin in the steel pan last night, delicious. This OXO pan retains heat very well for a nonstick, certainly can't retain heat as well as cast iron, carbon steel or stainless steel but this retains heat better than any other nonstick that I have used. I have now bought a 8 inch version of this pan for eggs and I'm so happy. I cook a lot and even if you only cook a little, buy it. This pan is totally worth it, makes cooking so easy and much more enjoyable."
"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance. He loves it. No warping even heat distribution. We even heat our next day warm up pizza on it. To answer a question that seems to be asked a lot.. Warping is cause by over heating the skillet. The highest temp we cook with it is med to med low. Once we are done cooking it is taken off the hot burner and place on a burner that is NOT in use until it cools down properly. How cool is properly? When it is cool to the touch.. you can pick it up without burning your fingers. Also, taking it off the stove and putting it in cool or cold water can cause warping. (Yes there are a few who do that then wonder why it warps). But mainly your cooking on it with too high of heat. Any light weight metal pan flat or fry pan etc., teflon, or no teflon can be warped that way. We love ours the first one we bought wore out. And not due to warpage."
"I have the large and medium OXO pan. I had the large first, and after months of stress free cooking and cleaning I knew exactly what to get when my previous medium pan bit the dust. As we know, no non-stick pan lasts forever, but these really hang in there. I only hand wash them, of course. They actually do a fairly good job of browning, too, though non-sticks are not ideal for that. They are oven safe to a pretty high temp, so you can do that ""brown first and finish in oven"" thing easily. You have to remember to follow directions. They include them for a reason. Read them. Don't heat them to the high temp, even if your recipe says to. Don't put cold water in directly after cooking. And for the love of all that's holy, do NOT spray with cooking spray, no matter what the directions day in your recipe. It causes gumminess that will ruin the pan. A quick drizzle of EVOO will do the job.  The price is quite good. I have several OXO utensils in my kitchen and I love every one of them."
Arrived Tuesday. My husband unwrapped it. Came in large box wrapped in paper.  He’s been using it. Today is the first time for me.  The skillet is not perfectly round. It looks as though it has been dropped on one side. The rim is slightly flattened.  I don’t think it’s a big deal except that I paid $60.00 for it.
"The instructions for this pan says ""do not use dishwashing soap that contains citrus."" Well, my favorite dish soap contains grapefruit. So I never pour soap in the pan or let it sit in soapy water. Instead, I clean it under running water with a baby bottle brush just until I see the patina barely lighten. That's about 3 swirls of the brush then, hand towel dry. After more than a year of cooking, it still looks and performs great. I also bought a universal glass/silicone lid, 9-to-12inch size, that fits both my Oxo pan and a wok. I've always used this pan on top - never inside of any oven. After purchasing the Oxo, for some reason, I read the instructions and learned about the damaging effect of citrus soap. I don't know if it's the soap chemistry or just citrus juice that will ruin the non-stick surface. Most dishwashing soaps have some kind of citrus in it like orange, lemon, or grapefruit. But, I think the warning is proven true by the reviews complaining about the coating. I hope my review helps others get more life out of their Oxo pan. It's a really good one."
"I have a glass top electric stove. This type of stove requires a FLAT bottom pan in order to cook properly. I purchased a heavy aluminum pan from Sam's Club initially but found the flat bottom was rounded slightly and did not cook properly. I couldn't get the bottom flat so I broke down and purchased teflon coated All Clad fry pan. The All Clad worked great - it was very flat, held heat well and cooked evenly. The only down side was the teflon began to peel a few months after the guarantee ran out. I paid plenty for the All Clad pan and decided to try another brand. After doing my research I settled on the 12 inch Oxo non-stick Pro fry pan. Though it doesn't hold the heat as long as the All Clad I like the Oxo pan better. The bottom is very flat, it heats up quickly and cooks evenly. No regrets buying this pan."
The quality of this item is noticeably better than the tefal. I had always bought the other brand because I thought it had a high quality coating but this is a heavier skillet and it does a better job all around. one of the biggest problems I have with skillets is there handles getting loose over time even more than the finish on the default the finish would be fine but the handle would be coming off. I have another version of this Skillet in a smaller size that I've been using for over a year and the handle remains very solid.but this particular size just works better for the kind of cooking I do and I'm really glad to have finally replaced the wobbly Skillet I was trying to use with one that is a lot safer to use because the handle is firm. But it's also a heavier weight Skillet and so everything Cooks so much better in it.
"This multi-purpose skillet meets many needs. It arrived quickly, packed in a very protective fashion. I had purchased a round soft- bristled brush whose handle can contain liquid detergent to use for cleaning. To date, having used the skillet to sauté, fry, bake, and as a Bain Marie for custard pies, I am delighted with its multiple performances. I avoid the nasty build up of sticky residue that damages non-stick pans by never using spray oils on it. I will never put it in the dishwasher, either. The brush mentioned earlier here is totally adequate for cleaning the pan thoroughly. There are no seams between the.walls and the bottom of the skillet, making it a snap to both move the cooking foods and to clean. It heats evenly. The handle is comfortable in my fairly ancient grip. I am beyond pleased with my purchase."
"When I began searching for a 12"" non-stick skillet I looked at another brand that was formerly recommended by ATK. I then looked at their current recommendation( 2019) the OXO 12"" non-stick skillet and purchased it. This skillet has been excellent for the money spent. A true value. It has seen daily use, being used in the preparation of several meals a day. Seeing this frequency of use, it has been washed at least once or more, by hand and sometimes by machine, each day. The cooking surface and handle each have held up extremely well. The cooking surface has only minor blemishes and the handle is still firmly attached to the pan as it was when new. For the money, the heat distribution, the cooking surface, the handle ergonomics, ease of use and ease of cleaning cannot be beat. I was impressed enough by the product that I added the 8"" OXO non-stick pro to my kitchen in early 2020. Full disclosure: This is the second 12"" OXO non-stick trying pan I received. The first arrived damaged(bent, out of round.) It was easily remedied by Amazon. I returned the first one, and replaced it."
"I purchased the OXO nonstick fry pan as it was the top rated one by America's Test Kitchen. It has more than lived up to expectations. The most important feature is that I can cook eggs and omelettes without the need for oil, though for some applications, a thin coat of vegetable oil before turning on the pan makes the eggs even easier to remove. Around the same time I bought a 8"" Scan Pan non-stick from Sur La Table as someone had given me a gift certificate. When I try to cook eggs in the Scan Pan without first adding oil, the eggs stick. I should add that I cook on a Viking gas stove and use medium low heat to cook eggs. The OXO functions well and at the price point, when it eventually starts showing its age, you won't mind getting a new one."
"I don’t believe in nonstick pads because of the danger associated, however, my 81-year-old mom will not use anything else but us so it was time to replace her older one.  She says this one is very comfortable to use considering she has arthritis throughout her body. It is a perfect size for her and it’s not too heavy to handle. It’s easy to wash and the heat distribution seems to be doing great for her. She has no complaints about it!  That my friends, makes the high cost worth it!"
"This is a great skillet, love it! But the best part is the fact that the rivets that hold the handle on have been coated with the non-stick substance. Other non-stick skillets leave these bare so that everything cleans off easily EXCEPT the rivet heads. Bonus info… we picked this one because we saw that it was a TOP PICK on Cook’s Country Test Kitchen."
"My favorite part about this pan is the handle. It has no openings that can fill with soapy water or what have you. The handle is hollow and yet completely sealed and attached by a fork. It stays totally cool to the touch I really love it. My only complaint about this is that I wish there was a lid because I always cook with the lid over the frying pan so it doesn't splash. It is supposedly a 10 inch lid but when I put a 10 inch lid it is much too small and fits actually inside of the pan. I hesitate to use these lids because I'm afraid it might scratch the inside of the pan. Metal against metal and all. I wish oh it's so made hey glass lid for this pan. I purchased 11 inch pan cover lid, but it was just a hair too large and the lip actually fell outside of the frying pan and made a mess and was unusable."
"We have been on a one year journey for the perfect pan for egg white omelettes using very minimal oil. We were hesitant about the nonstick coating being toxic but read several articles on this pan, and decided to go for it. We cooked a 4 egg white omelette with veggies in 1 tsp oil and it was amazing. Probably could have used 1/2 tsp too and it would have been fine. Hopefully the nonstick coating stays on, will update this review later if there are any changes. For now, this is great."
"I bought this to fill out a set from another well regarded company when their 8"" wasn't available, and I couldn't wait. I wish now I had purchased all of them from OXO. The non-stick coating works beautifully, and the pan heats very evenly. It does show some scratching from the spatula I used to use (also from OXO, which is interesting), but it's very light and doesn't seem to affect the function of the coating - it may have simply been that the original coating was so glassy. I have since started using a different utensil, and it has stopped scratching. It gets used 5 to 6 days per week for breakfast, sometimes for other meals as well. It cleans up easily, and with the full stainless handle, it can be used to finish omelets under the broiler with no concerns. It's weighty without being heavy, so on our electric range it tends to maintain a more even heat than the one it replaced. While it does remain to be seen how long the coating will hold up, so far I can't recommend it highly enough."
"I know oil and butter can taste great... but I wanted to eat omelette without them in my diet. And holy hell does it NOT stick. I just beat the eggs together with whatever and drop it in there. Nothing sticks, except for maybe fatty meats and they barely do, and are easy to clean off with a tissue.  Just use the proper ways to wash it and it'll stay 95% non-stick for at least a year. I have never been happier to own a fry-pan.  Also use a pan cover when making omelettes, just try it and thank me later.  Cons: Will start looking really ugly from the bottom side after enough uses, and you can'y fully clean that if at all. (but who care about that really)"
"So what do I have to add when there are already over 3000 reviews? Just that I have tried a bunch of non-stick pans and found them wanting before settling on this one. The acid test for me is whether eggs stick. They don't, even after repeated uses. This pan is not as thick as the Swiss Diamond pan, at over three times the price, but it still heats evenly and quickly. Little detail: they took the trouble to non-stick coat the rivets, which most other pans leave open to sticking food. Washes easily. Non-stick coatings wear off eventually, but this pan is cheap enough that it won't break the bank when it's time to replace it. A tool that works. Stick with it! (Pun intended)"
"After spending $100+ on a pan with a super duper coating on the inside and specially treated stainless clad aluminum on the outside, we were very disappointed. The special features that were advertised were just plain false when we read the owner’s manual. And then when we realized the warranty was worthless, we were hacked.  We ran across a review from America’s Test Kitchen for this pan. Their testing was thorough and the price was reasonable, so we tried it. I am amazed at how well it performs. In the same amount of time our pricey pan pooped out, this skillet shines. EASY to clean up, very non-stick, and the weight is right. I’m sure we will get another, but smaller size."
"This pan had probably been used every since it arrived. It has a very durable nonstick surface and the edges are angled perfectly so you can easily get at the food. The handle is sturdy, helps me look like a champ when I'm flipping food.  It is pretty thick so it takes longer than most pans to warm up but once hot it retains the heart well and distributes it evenly even with the larger pans in this series.  It cleaned up very easily, it's never been in the dishwasher because it whipes clean without any effort.  It's great for fried eggs but you have to use some sort of oil, I've tried cooking them in this pan without any or very little oil and they end up cooking with a stranger texture."
Cleans easy. Heats well. Non stick is perfect even after 10 months the of everyday use. Try it. Don’t listen to bad reviews
"This is the second OXO griddle I have purchased, the first one having been sent to my grand daughter's college apartment. It is highly rated for a reason. When I looked to replace it, I checked other products, but none compared with this one, which I had owned for several years. I just KNEW I could pay for an All Clad and it would be better. Not so. My main use of the griddle is making breakfast, which starts with sautéing a few peppers in butter, moving them to the side, warming a tortilla on the griddle and adding shredded cheese to it, then, after moving the tortilla, breaking an egg into the peppers, which I've moved back to the center. The new griddle is perfect; I can use the lowest flame on my propane stove and with patience the egg cooks to a perfect sunny-side-up (though I usually flip it & turn off the fire.) I gave 4 stars on the hot spots because yes, where the circular flame hits the pan gets hotter than the 4 corners. This can be used to advantage, as the already cooked items can be moved to a corner while other items get cooked. If feeding more than one person, four eggs can be scrambled and cooked in the pan very nicely. Just learn where your burner's hot spots are so the eggs can be moved around accordingly. Making french toast and pancakes could be another entire review; both do quite well in this pan."
I bought the 8-inch frying pan about 3 years ago and have used it about once a week since then - and it still looks and works like brand new! The finish still looks like brand new and requires no oil to get perfect non-stick performance. This made it an easy decision to recently buy the 12-inch size to replace a T-fal pan that only lasted about 2 years.
"I bought this almost a year ago for making pancakes, and I don't think I've used it for anything else yet, but I've used it several times for that. It's big enough to fit four decent sized pancakes, the handle is comfortable, the heat distribution seems very good (also, strangely, when you get the bottom wet, you can faintly see the distribution design), and it's very easy to clean. Just rinsing it off gets most of the stuff off of it, and a light rubbing with your hand or a washcloth will get the rest. I can't say if it's perfectly flat, since pancake batter is thicker than something like eggs, and so doesn't tend to run as much, but I've not had any problems with it running. I try to avoid nonstick as much as possible, but as long as you don't overheat it and you don't use it when it's damaged, it's (as far as we know) safe, and this seems to be a very good quality coating, so I don't expect any issues with it getting damaged for a long time so long as it's handled properly."
"All the non-stick action you've been wanting. I've made eggs at twice the frequency just because it's such a delight to have zero stickage. I needed a new frypan and hit up America's Test Kitchen to see what their recommendation was. I'm a big believer in pay less for a product and replace it more often in the kitchen (for the most part). Yes, I could pay $400 bucks and have a pot for ten years but how good are those last five? The last two? I'd rather pay a fraction of that and have a brand new one every one to two years. So far, this looks to be an excellent pan for that sort of use case. Heat distribution is very even, the handle is comfortable in the hand, the slope of the walls is quite nice. I like it. We'll see how it holds up!"
"As a loyal ATK follower and foodie, I have bought several of their recommended items. Most work out well, a few have not. My Tramontina pan started losing its coating so, the search was on. This OXO pan is a great size, fairly light and nice looking but, the coating...OMG. This pan is coated with the same stuff Chevy Chase put on his disc sled in Christmas Vacation; no joke its that slick. NOTHING....sticks to it. Its so slick that flipping small items is a bit challenging. Cleanup is so, so simple that this pan should literally never be dirty. So far its a real winner; time will tell."
The OXO 12 inch frypan is an excellent addition to my kitchen. I own but one nonstick fry pan for convenience sake. I'm a home cook and don't require many different types of frypans. My other pans are either cast iron or stainless steel as I feel these pans to be somewhat more health conscious. There are some foods that really benefit from a nonstick cooking surface. OXO has engineered a really nice nonstick frypan. All the reviews I have seen or read about helped convince me to purchase this pan. Eggs and fish seem to benefit the most on this cooking surface. It's a great pan and I'm glad to add this to my collection ( even though it's a small collection )
"I was looking for a non-stick, 8"" fry pan. This was recommended by America's Test Kitchen. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! It cleans like a dream and cooks eggs, etc. beautifully. The only thing missing is a tempered glass cover. However, I found the OZERI tempered glass cover on Amazon. It fits perfectly, has a nice handle, and a little vent to let out steam. LOVE that, too!"
"So far after a couple months of regular use I have no complaints. The pan is easy to use and is a good size for both smaller meals, or cooking vegetables for a family. It has a good Slope to the inner wall which keeps food from getting stuck in any corners or crevices. I don’t have a dishwasher and I only wash by hand, but even sticky messages seem to be easy to clean with just soap and a sponge."
"Bought this skillet to replace my worn out old AllClad scrambled egg pan. This one cooks a bit more quickly but with even heat distribution up the nicely curved sides. The comfortable and substantial handle doesn’t overbalance the pan on the gas stove grates as my old one did. Yes, everything wipes right out as it should in a brand new non-stick skillet. I will give it a while to see how long that non-stick lasts and update. In the meantime it has two features I haven’t had before and really like. The outside is the same dark gray as the rest of the pan and wipes off just as easily so no constant scouring needed to keep it new looking. The iron grate hasn’t scratched it. Second, and even better is that the two bolts attaching the handle are also coated with non-stick surface so no digging out the little of egg stuck between the two. This new pan brightens my mornings."
"I have been searching for a good non-stick pan and was hesitate to pay more than $30 for that. I have used other OXO products and they always meet my expectation. So even with the price ($50) above my budget, I still give it a try. It is a truly non-stick pan, and easy to clean. I made red bean sauce with it which could be a nightmare for any pans, but they came off easily. It says the pan is dishwasher safe but for prolonging the life of then pan I havent tried it in dishwasher yet. It is just soooo easy to clean that I dont mind just wash it separately (I am a really lazy person usually throw everything in dishwasher). So far we are still in honeymoon :) may come back to change the reviews after some time"
"After trying out expensive carbon steel fry pans, I abandoned their high-maintenance, fickle behavior and settled on pans that I didn't have to stress over whether they would become unseasoned for the umpteenth time by just using them. The engineering of Oxy Good Grips Pro is so evident; lightweight but substantial, the non-drip edge is simple but brilliant, the handles are perfectly designed and while I didn't expect it, the rivets have the same non-stick coating as the interior pan surface. I may be delusional, but the non-stick surface seems like it could last more than the 3-5-year life expectancy of the average pan. To back that up, they come with a lifetime warranty! I bought the 8"" and the 12"" and now I'm getting the 10"" before something weird happens and they discontinue the line. Make sure you get the ""Pro"" line, that's the one Cook's rated the best (and it is no-wonder)."
"I’ve got an iron clad 12 inch skillet and I use that for all my cooking. Durable, reliable, backed with life time warranty, just my go-to. But hey sometimes u want some ease and convenience of that non-stick. And without breaking the bank with all clad’s hex pan this is solid pan that should last me a good couple years and I won’t feel spending guilt just tossing and buying a new one. With the rec of ATK I’m happy with this pan and highly recommend!"
"After having purchased many different non-stick fry pans over many years, this one is absolutely the best. I use non metallic implement with this pan. i happen to watch American Test Kitchen and they reviewed different brands. They found this OXO brand to be the best. So I bought one. It is the best I have ever used. Today after a lot of use, it is STILL slick like new. Stuff slides so easy in the pan that there have been times when the spatula had a hard time getting under the item because it slides away from the spatula. I would buy again in a Nano second!"
This is an amazing pan. Love the shape and they way you can manipulate food within the pan. I replaced a T Fal pan that had warped when T Fal made me jump through hoops to get warranty replacement service. I have many OXO products and should have bought this in the first place! I LOVE this pan.
"Great nonstick ceramic skillet! Like everyone else commenting here, I have had many experiences with ruining nonstick skillets.  This is my second skillet of this brand/type, and the first one is holding up well because I am finally following the following rules:  Never heat beyond low or medium.  Heat empty for one minute – – no more.  Never use oil spray! The propellant creates a sticky problem over time.  After one minute of heating, add a very small amount of butter or oil. Heat 30 seconds, then add your food.  Never, ever use any utensils with this skillet except for plastic or silicone!  Forget the dishwasher. Only AFTER the skillet is cool, gently wash it with a sponge and soap. Dry it gently and do not stack it with other hard items unless you put a dish towel between them.  This sounds like a lot of trouble, but it's a lot more trouble to throw out your nonstick skillet every few months when it loses its nonstick qualities.  One other piece of advice: order one of these exclusively for cooking omelettes or other eggs. Never cook anything else in it. A good French omelette requires a wonderfully nonstick surface."
"OK I bought this pan four months ago at the time I was very excited because of the reviews 😃I said to myself This must really good nonstick pan🤔 so I tried it out I decided to fry an egg oh boy I was happy😃 I wasn’t too excited though because I haven’t really had used it enough, so I tried to make some stirfry which requires high heat😳🥵 well come to find out that did not work out so well when I went to use it again everything was sticking😱☹️ So I contacted Amazon they gladly sent me out another pan… I have to say I love Amazons policy I have never had any problems and I’ve been with them for many many years ! and I really don’t write too many reviews but I had to do this one. So I received my second pan and I had company come over that week, I was telling them the experience I had with my new pan and they told me, do you realize with a nonstick pan you cannot use high heat🤪? I did not know this ….so that is why I am writing this review so I decided not to use high heat on my new pan ☺️I have had it for four months now …did that work ? I’m telling you it’s like brand new i use it practically every day Iam so happy with my purchase and I want other people to realize this pan is not for high heat and gentle care no abrasive tools or soap and you will love it 😍"
"I have a hard time giving cookware 5 stars. Perhaps it is the price range I tend to shop in for it, so I do that to myself, which I have accepted. However, this lovely turquoise frying pan has changed my life. I've steered clear of things one sees on TV like ceramics and copper. Reviews on average usually declare them to be nothing special, so I had been settled on the idea that there are two levels of cookware: peasant and billionaire. I am neither, but peasant is far more palatable than billionaire. This frying pan makes me feel like I've just bought billionaire. I love the relationship it has with my food and how easy it is to clean all evidence of said relationship. I worried that the pretty turquoise color would fall victim to the heating elements - it hasn't. It's still pretty turquoise. It isn't terribly heavy and it feels like it was made well. So, this is how the 1% feel."
"I bought this pan for my husband, so he did not ruin my new set of pans. I bought this because of two things: the price, and its not Teflon. I was looking at this set when I bough my new set and decided against it. But, boy am I really surprised. This one is one of the cheaper models that this company offers and I have to say....This pan is really nice. These sorts of pans need a little oil or butter in them to perform well, and this one does! I use low heat on all of my non Teflon pans and this is no exception. Lightweight without feeling cheap, nice handle and good heat distribution. The only downside is no metal conductor on the bottom of the pan. But after using for about a month on gas stove, it is holding up nicely with hardly any evidence of use. I use only silicone utensils on the pan and so far no problems. My husband is really hard on cookware and this is holding up to his high heat fast cooking style. I will be looking at this company's options if I am ever in need of new set. Would be nice if these companies would offer separate lids for an option. Really like the lids with the silicone rim. Just saying."
"We cook at home every night. And I mean, every night. A good pan is essential. I did a lot of research before selecting this one and I am not disappointed. After 20-30 uses, it is still as non-stick as the day we bought it. I only handwash my pots & pans. Others have shown wear after a month and a half, but not this pan. Even the base, which is the same teal color as the sides, hasn't stained and washes clean. I'm amazed. I want the whole set now. We've even let food sit overnight, not on purpose, but ya know, sometimes dishes don't get washed right away. It still washes clean with ease. and I mean with ease. Like a soapy sponge, wipe 3-4 times around in a circle, BAM it's clean! Did I mention that I want the whole set now?"
"These are the only plans I use other than cast iron. Easy to clean, you have to use wood or plastic utensils but I'm fine with that. Tip... say you get the pan a bit too hot with oil in it, and the oil gets stuck making the surface sticky? After washing the pan, dry it, then pour in a little rubbing alcohol and a tablespoon of coarse salt. Gently scrub these around the pan with a paper towel. After very little effort, the oil comes right off and the non stick surface is still pristine. I use my pans 3+ times per day, and don't have to replace them unless someone drops something sharp onto them and ruins the surface. I'll buy these as long as they are made"
"It delivers what I want: quick energy transfer to food, browns foods nicely, easyyyyy to clean. I have seen reviews indicating cracking, burning, and poor performance. You have to be smart about what this product is, aluminum alloy with a thin ceramic coating and a temperature resistance handle. Do not immerse it in fluids while hot or even warm. Leave it alone and let it come to room temperature! Your handle melted? Well, don't leave the handle over a flame and keep your flame down to prevent heat from being excessive. This pan works quite well over a moderately low flame. If you want a tank or a bull in a china shop go get an iron skillet. If you want a well made gem that requires attention for that perfect omelet then buy this."
"I have wanted to make the switch to ceramic pans and bake ware for some time. When my old frying pan's Teflon coating (something I want to get away from) started flaking, I decided to try this pan. After using it, I decided to replace my current set with a full line of GreenLife's pots and pans (I will buy bake wear in the future). The pan is lightweight and I love the soft grip handles, they are cool to the touch and very secure. There has been no sticking at all and clean up is an absolute breeze. I am careful to follow usage and washing instructions and I just loved it. Looking forward to my complete set arriving."
"my hubby does the cooking ... we'd still been using our 20 year old beat up Teflon (YUK) fry pans. While browsing around for new ones, I was struck by the idea and the reviews of cooking on ceramic. Hubby was surprised when we received it. Bought this in 2 sizes. He hadn't used ceramic pans before, either. Well, he is now practically OBSESSED with these. Everything he cooks in them is the bomb . He can flip a fried egg in the small pan without utensils... like a chef. He's very amusing. The clean up is a snap. Great for browning or cooking meats, pancakes,grilled cheese.... NOTHING sticks. The chef in the family is just thrilled. I cannot comment on durability. I really hope the surface in these pans holds up well. Never making the mistake of using metal utensils... because I want these to last!"
"As long as you do what they tell you to, this is a dream pan. Don't heat too high - trust me, food will cook just fine on lower heat. Don't poke at your food with a metal spatula or stir it with a metal spoon. Wooden or silicon implements will keep this pan pristine. Cleans so so easily! Oh, and no cooking spray. But I use olive oil in it all the time, since the heat is medium, and it cooks beautifully."
"A fine nonstick pan. I received one of these GreenLife ceramics as a freebie to review, and then two years later I bought another to replace it. The older pan is still good, but I like my everyday pots & pans to look nice. The older pan did pick up some stains (note the white interior) and had a slight warp from too much heat (the latter my bad). The nonstick properties stayed good over time, but of course it's much better in year 1.  Not for the dishwasher or for high heat. Plastic-coated utensils, as with any good nonstick. I use mainly for eggs and cooking half-cooked tortillas, but of course the pan has many uses. Good for sweating veggies. (I use a smaller All-Clad nonstick pan for heavier lifting.)  The new green GreenLife pan is a bit more attractive than the older one and the handle feels good in the hand. I got a good price. Pleased!"
I've had this pan for over a month now and use it almost every day. My previous pan was only a couple years old and had the dark non-stick coating. It had started pealing in the middle of the pan. I don't think that can happen to this one. The ceramic is very smooth. It's better than any non-stick pan I've ever had. My food doesn't stick and cleaning it is so easy. Definitely recommend!
"Follow the instructions and this will work well. No high heat, only plastic utensils, and wash by hand. If you do this, this pan will last for a long time and keep non-stick. My first one lasted two+ years, and only stopped being non-stick because some teenagers didn’t follow the no-high-heat rule."
"I have bought a couple of these pans, they last about a year when frying eggs once or twice daily. They're so lightweight & wipe clean with a paper towel. No rivets for food to get stuck in!! The turquoise brightens up the kitchen & doesn't stain easily. I'll buy another one next year & the year after that. Great pan!"
I really love this pan! I bought it to be able to cook without adding fat and have things like pancakes and tortillas and flat breads not stick to the pan. This works really great. I know that fat can actually release the nonstick coating and that is why after a while these pans have to be replaced. At least this one isn't that expensive but I'm hoping not cooking meat on it and not using cooking spray will keep it for a much longer time! I'll have to come back and check in after a few months. Thanks! This works great!
"So far, this skillet has been great. Totally non-stick and very easy to clean. The cool handle is a great feature and works perfectly. Non-stick skillets have a way of losing functionality over time. We’ve only had this one a short time and it’s still great. It does seem to be substantial and looks like it will last a long time. But, only time will tell."
"Wanted to try these chemical free ceramic skillets for a long time. I am not disappointed. This beautiful, expensive-looking skillet is 12” diameter. Large enough to cook for a small family. The food after cooking just slides off and is so easy to just wipe out then rinse when cool. Handle is ridged and very easy to hold and comfortable. I cooked 5 slices of bacon and three eggs at the same time I just put s little veg oil in pan first. Don’t use spray oil as it can cause damage to pan. I love it! Wish I could afford thee tire set!"
"My husband always swore by Rachel Ray pans, his pan was starting to stick and he'd been complaining about it, I had recently bought a ceramic skillet and was in love with how well things didn't stick in it. This pan has not dissappointed yet, wipes clean, non stick, and it feels nice and sturdy. I think he's fallen in love with his new pan, move over Rachel Ray I think this pan has you beat"
"This pan is so generous in size, it has held up after three months perfectly, it is still extremely non-stick with a very slippery surface that is awesome for cooking eggs and anything else. I think the reason some people had trouble with the nonstick surface is because they turned the burner up too high. The manufacturers instructions state very clearly that it is supposed to be a medium heat pan. If you’re the kind of person that cranks the burner up to high, it probably will not hold out."
"I've owned both expensive and cheap ceramic coated fry pans. I've found that within 6-12 months, they all lose there non-stick ability. This is not a flaw in this product, all ceramic coatings lose there non-stick ability after a while. I now buy inexpensive fry pans and replace when food starts to stick."
I have had my pan for a yearIt never disappoints always makes the best eggs or grilled sandwiches that you’ll ever have go ahead and drop the extra couple bucks and get the heck away from the Teflon that stuff peels off and gets in our bodies
"I bought this skillet 'cause it was time to replace my old one. I am absolutely loving it! It's big enough for our needs for cooking and super easy to clean. I simply wipe it out and it's good to go again. Olive oil was not recommended so I use avocado oil, but I have also used olive oil. I just don't let the oil get hot before I start cooking."
""
These pans are great. With a little oil foods dont stick. So easy to clean. Let it cool and then cleans up perfectly. Caution: read instructions because these cook at a lower temp than standard pans and the pans get plenty hot for all cooking.
"I bought this pan originally from a grocery store. It was great for a while but after years of having it, it got a lot of scratches on it and started to get food stuck more easily on the pan. We bought this new one, and it's really a relief to not have food get stuck to it anymore lol. We won't be using metal on the pan again, wood or silicon only. Cleans up easy, cooks well."
I like that this pan does not need to be seasoned. The directions say to be patient and use low to medium heat. The pan does not burn and I anticipate this pan lasting a lot time. I have been using is for a few months and it is my favorite pan now.
"We have had one of these for some time, and it's my wife's favorite, as it is heavy enough to not have hot spots in the bottom. So we felt confident that this was a quality gift (for a reasonable price)."
"I use this skillet more than any other cooking pan. It's important to follow the advice on the instructions for a long use. It has no harmful chemicals in the materials, easiest cleaning of any skillet, energy saving as you can fry on a 4 stove top setting. So far I mostly use the 3 and 4 midrange settings when cooking. After use, I hand wash it with a soft cloth and hot soapy water, rinse, let it cool, dry it and place the plastic cover back on it before storing it separately."
"After spending an exorbitant amount of money on high end nonstick non toxic pans only to be incredibly disappointed, this pan fits the bill! It is truly nonstick. It heats evenly. And it is a breeze to clean. Cannot recommend enough. Don’t be like me and spend $100+ on the fancy nonstick pans from the store... these are better."
"Okay this is the fourth and final order... so far. We ordered the 15 piece set then we ordered two extra pots, then we ordered two extra skillets, and finally we ordered this large skillet. I think we are done ordering for a while... but as you can tell we really love this set. I hope they last a long time."
"having read all the negative reviews people have given these pans, I can only say: if you read the instructions and treat them accordingly they last. They take a bit more grease than Teflon but they work well. I have had mine for almost a year and the insides are like new. The outside of these pans is harder to keep clean than the inside though and it seems to absorb burn stains more than normal pans. All and all, I like them and would order them again to replace Teflon."
"I have used this pan a lot since I got it. It’s perfect. Medium to low heat it cooks everything perfectly and looks just as good as the day I unpacked it. I’m getting a set of saucepans to match and some other items to match, so pretty."
"This is the best pan I have ever used. NOTHING sticks to it. When I'm preparing a meal I feel like the food is fighting over getting to be cooked in this pan. If I wasn't already married I'd marry it. update: I've been using this pan heavily for 9 months now, and it's still like new. Nothing sticks to it. I take very good care of it. Treat it like my baby. Love it so much I bought my mother one."
"Love everything about this pan. The 12"" size is fantastic for cooking a lot at once with excellent heat distribution. Can just wipe clean if desired. Will buy other pots and pans of this brand."
I am a fan. Hands down one of the best pots I have ever used. Made taco meat in it and everything just slid right out for an easy clean up. No staining and nothing stuck to the bottom. Will definitely buy more sizes and recommend to anyone looking for a fantastic pot
I saw that other reviewers were not happy with this pan since they had problems with food sticking and it staining the pan permanently. I did what another reviewer suggested by only using medium heat and I use avocado oil. I have had the pan for over 4 months and use it every morning to cook eggs and it still looks like new!! One suggestion that I will make is that I clean it with a little Dawn dish washing liquid on a wet paper towel. That seems to work well without scratching it.
This is my third pan for the past 4 years. It has been user's error and that's why I needed to replace it. It is easy to clean and size is perfect to make multiple fried eggs in the morning.
"This pan cleans so easy, just what I wanted: a pan with non-toxic coating that cleans easily. I can't speak to durability yet but so far so good."
"This pan is perfect. Nothing sticks, cooks great and clean up is super easy. Highly recommend.  The color is so pretty too. I bought the turquoise."
Very sturdy. Used this morning and heat distribution was great. Very easy clean.  I watch Flavcity and Bobby pointed out some frying pans are still toxic. I am very happy to replace my 10 year old frying pan with Green Life.
"Bought my wife the set last year for Christmas , it didn’t come with a big skillet. The set has held up will for over a year now. Just needed a bigger skillet"
Any of these negative reviews I think are because people aren't following the rules. I've had it for 6 months now and have had no issues!
I bought the regular set for myself for Christmas from my parents! LOL They are making me wait to open it but I bought this pan on my own. So far I absolutely love it. It's great and I searched every where for a nicely priced set of ceramic pots I could put in the dishwasher. I NEVER wash things by hand! These are great!
"No hardware on the inside, which is great. Very easy to clean, cooks very well. Don't use high heat or dishwasher though - I have done this in the past with similar coated pans (other brands) and it ruins them. Love these pans."
"Makes the best eggs at lower temperatures which saves energy and is do much better for our health. Green product with no outgasing issues. Cleans up with no sticking. Fabulous colors, outstanding value!"
Just for the fun of it threw in a handful of grated cheese and cooked it down. It slid right off of pan. Just being careful though and not using my metal utensils so it’s held up well.
"Low cooking temp and is easy to clean, no more burned food. It is more bang for the buck, than copper non stick. Makes an excellent grilled cheese"
This pan is so light weight and a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. I can cook a giant breakfast in this and not worry about it spilling over the sides. It’s not particularly deep but it’s just right for a pan
This was an addition to the set I bought her to replace the old beat up set. So far she loves using them. She cooks and I do dishes. Everything she cooks pretty much just rinses off. A little soap and water and job is done. Made cleaning up after cooking super easy.
"The ceramic surface is truly non-stick and it cleans up easily. The heavy (but not too heavy) bottom makes good contact with the burners, which insures rapid heating of the pan and efficient and even cooking. As with any non-stick pan, please don't clean it with abrasives or stack other pans on top of it, because that might damage the surface. This pan COOKS very nice and LOOKS very nice too! This pan absolutely lives up to its advertising! We like them so well, we've bought two more!"
"I've always hated those teflon coated pans that get easily scratched (and then leech into your food!). This pan is sleek, cooks foods like eggs and tofu beautifully (with no stick), and lightweight so you can easily transfer food to dishes. Being a pastel lover myself, the colors are lovely. I'll be buying the other size pans as well."
"I was hesitant to buy a new pan, but I caved. I have to say, the purchase was definitely worth it! I've used it constantly the last 4 days, and I have no complaints. It heats up nicely, nothing has been stuck to the pan, it's been easy to wipe clean. The handle is super cozy for my hand, and well, the color is awesome.  I have cooked eggs, bacon, fried rice, sausage, zucchini, and hashbrowns.... and it's worked great with them all!"
"It is the second time I purchase this pan. it is amazing, it just require you to be careful while cleaning, I always poor water and turn the heat on to let the particles come loose. it works great with eggs, light and great quality."
"I needed a brand that was good AND most importantly safe to use around my parrot. This was both. Cooks evenly, easy to clean, as a bonus. Will stick with this brand from now on."
Love these! I have it in 3 sizes. I gave up teflon coating because I think there are some serious health questions and ceramic seems to be a better option. Plus the green is really cute!
"Great non-stick pans. Use caution and don't use metal cooking tools with them, I chipped the surface cutting out stuff that I baked in a pan and using a steel spatula on a fry pan. Just FYI. Would I buy again YES!"
"For a non-stick extra skillet, seems very nice. I am super careful with it. I will be interested to see how long it lasts. So far so good. It looks nice and cooks nice. No complaints."
"We bought a whole set of these from walmart but the set didn't have a pan this size, it is a nice big size and they are really great for the stoves that are the smooth glass top surface stoves that aren't suppose to have the pans with the metal ring bottoms. Those can scratch the stove surface, so these are just flat pans that work wonderfully. They also have a quick and fast clean up to them"
I use this pan for practically every thing. It's actually a replacement one.
This pan is so easy to cook in and nothing sticks. you do have to be careful and only use wood or soft material spatula. We cook with butter or coconut oil or olive oil for flavoror a coconut spray. It cleans up wonderful. We want more pans from the same company.
"Love this skillet! I use it probably three times a day with the quarantine and all. I use it for eggs, pancakes, hamburgers, grilled cheese, warming leftovers, etc... Its easy to clean and very durable. I’m planning to get another. I don’t put it in the dishwasher."
"We love this pan! We wanted to move away from teflon, but weren't sure if we could find a better substitute. This has been quite an upgrade! This size is generous, it heats evenly, and best of all, nothing sticks.  We have tried many different foods in this pan, and so far nothing has stuck. Washing is a breeze; food just wipes right off. The grip is comfortable, and the pan is very light. So far, we haven't found anything not to love about this pan. We may start a set."
This pan is wonderful! It cooks evenly. Its light weight. Food doesn't stick. Its easy to clean and the price was great! The only thing I wish it had was a lid!! Otherwise its great!
"these pans seem like they are good quality. they are heavy weight, the non-stick is great. only time will tell now. I've had them a few months and so far so good."
1. I love that it is non toxic. 2. Love how big it is. 3. Easy to clean. I made eggs the first time and just used a little butter for taste. No sticking or burning. It was beautiful ! 4. I'm going to buy the full set.
"We have converted all our cookware to ceramic. We love the easy clean up. Nothing sticks to the surface, it’s great! When cooking we use the proper utensils so as not to scratch the cookware. We would never go back to Teflon or coated cookware. Well worth the investment!"
I think this is the best skillet. It is nonstick. It Washes perfectly clean every time.
"I’ve had these pans for a couple of months and I really like them. They are lightweight for pans, they are so easy to clean. I wash it by hand directly after use and rinse. No scrubbing. I barely use any oil and I cook on medium heat."
Love these pans. They never stick. This is the second one I bought. Very happy with this purchase. I make the best eggs and omelets with these.
There is nothing we don’t like. They are the BEST pans on the market. I’ve never seen anything better. Say goodbye to Teflon pans RT Green
"I bought these because of America's Test Kitchen recommendation. I don't buy expensive non-stick fry-pans, you can spend $200 on non-stick pan but it will still not last for ever, no matter how careful you are. I think 2 years is a good expectancy for a non-stick skillet. Anyway, 2 of these were $40 and that is a very good deal. They get lots of use at my house and since my husband cooks as well as I do, they don't get very careful handling. Over the years, I had Circulon, Calphalon, All-Clad, you name it. Some were better then others but I think these OXO skillets are one of my favorites. They are really non-stick, making eggs is a dream. The grip is very comfortable, washing, thanks to the non-stick coating, is a breeze. I like them so much I bought a set for my son as well. I do recommend them.  July 2020 - it has been a year now of a heavy use and both skillets are still performing great."
"UPDATE: I received a very nice note from Amazon apologizing for these issues and promising to resolve it. Changed to 5 star because the pan is great. But - make sure yours is undamaged! :-) This is a simply outstanding pan - best I've ever owned (and I'm 51 years old). HOWEVER, when I tried to order another one, it came damaged. I returned it and the next one was damaged, too. I'm hoping third time is the charm!"
"It is a very rare review from my side, and for a reason. I use OXO for years, a good brand for kitchen gadgets, so I gave it a try - frying pan. I think the photos tell the whole story, this is after 3 weeks of use. I am a pedant home cook, use only wooden spoons/ utensils, even if it says ""scratch resistant"". So - to make the long story short - stay away from this piece of junk!!! Never in my life I had peeling after 3 weeks even using the cheapest Teflon pans from the supermarket. I will stick with Cuisinart, serve me well for years. What a mistake !  Additions - April 25: see updated photos, taken after one additional final use (before the arrival of my new Cuisinart pan). The ""German engineered"" non-stick coating (as described by Amazon) peeled off like I never saw before. Well, German engineered it is not, pure junk. So, if you decide to follow all the 5-star reviews here and buy this frying pan - go ahead, but be aware that your next omelette will contain an additional spice - German engineered non-stick coating. Bon Appetit !"
"I have used my pan for six months every day, sometimes twice a day and have had great results. After six months it has finally started sticking to the point that I decided to get another one. While it is a Cook's Illustrated winner, just be aware that it won't last forever."
"Cook's Illustrated's latest recommendation - haven't used it very much yet, but like what I've seen to date. No uneven or hot spots, sits flat (like it should, but not all brands manage...) and eggs slid out of it as if they had been cooked in oil (except I cooked them without any!)"
"Could not tell you how this performed. Received one damaged. One side was bowed out, but did not take a picture. Received the replacement and this one was damaged too. I took pictures of this one. Not sure who is to blame. Shipping box was not damaged, but there was not any padding or anything in the box with the pan."
"I bought these pans out of frustration with my T-Fal nonstick pans. My TFal pans are not flat on the bottom; oil and eggs avoid the middle and pool on the outer edge of the pan. The 8"" skillet that I received is flat. Unfortunately, the 10"" skillet is domed in the middle. The photo shows the behavior of water poured in the middle of the pan. Like my TFal non-stick pans, the water collects on the outer edge. I tested for this problem when I opened the box, so the doming is not the result of excessive heat (if that's possible in a fry pan) or other mishandling on my part. I will return these pans and try for another set. America's Test Kitchen rarely lets me down and the OXO is its top pick for reasons that include the flatness of the pan. OXO is a generally wonderful brand. Perhaps I got a lemon."
"Purchased this item after recommendation from America's Test Kitchen as the best nonstick skillet. I use non-stick skillets primarily for cooking eggs and other sticky foods. This pan is plenty large for cooking 4+ eggs, has a comfortable silicone handle, and sits stably on my gas stove top. I have found that the pan heats evenly, is easy to control the temperature, and requires minimal addition of fats for non-stick (although, I do add my butter and oil for the flavor). Overall, I've been very happy with this pan and would purchase it again. I had purchased the other long-time ATK recommended skillet by T-Fal, and had been disappointed with the crowning of the pan -- save yourself the trouble and just buy the OXO."
"I have had this 8"" skillet for just over 3 months & the non-stick coating had 2 small places where the coating was coming off. Cooking is not my hobby & I use it on the average of 2 - 3 times a week. I also hand wash it. I will be applying to OXO for a refund. Follow up: Customer service answered my 1st email promptly. But it went downhill from there. It took 26 days and 2 more emails along with proof of my shipping & tracking number to finally get a refund posted to my account. Of course it was for the purchase price of the skillet only as stated in the warranty. As a Prime member there was no outright shipping cost to receive it, but there was $1.22 sales tax. There was also shipping cost of $11.75 to return it. It cost me $12.97 to own this defective skillet for 3 months. This warranty is like many others, sounds good, but a bad quality product can be costly."
"This is head and shoulders the best non stick pan I have ever used. I love T-Fal for their long lasting non-stick coating, but the pans have always seemed lightweight and flimsy. This pan is sturdy and has a great handle. The pan heats far more evenly than T-fal and does not warp or bulge in the center of the pan when heated.  My biggest concern now is these pans are no longer on Oxo's website so I am worried they are going to be discontinued. Better grab them while you can!"
"The 12"" version of this pan is the winner in Cook's Illustrated's most recent non-stick pan test and I tend to trust their tests as they are thorough and mimic real life circumstances. They actually cooked an egg 50 times with no oil and no sticking.  I did my own egg test and sure enough, without any oil, the egg did not stick. I did get some egg bits around the pan, but they either came off with a soft spatula or with a quick wipe with a dry paper towel.  This pan seems big enough to cook a decent sized omelet and would fit 3 fried eggs comfortably. It is not ceramic, but the chemical coating only becomes unstable above 600 degrees and that's not going to happen on your stovetop. The handle is nice; it stays cool and has a good grip (as you'd expect from OXO). The pan heats evenly thanks to it's anodized aluminum. It will not however work on Induction. But for less than $20 this is the perfect price point for a non-stick pan since I have yet to encounter a non-stick pan that retains this property for more than 2 years."
"I’ve been a devoted Calphalon customer since I discovered their 12” non-stick omelet pan 25 years ago. Although their non-stick costing invariably lasted less than 2 years, Calphalon always honored their guarantee and promptly replaced the worn out pans, gratis. All I ever paid for was the shipping cost of sending back the worn out pans. Considering the skillet I question currently retails for $92, the replacement cost was negligible.  Sadly, the company was not satisfied with the design, and the changes they’ve made over the past two decades have seemed like change for its own sake with no direction or logic. The skillets were great but not perfect. Had they concentrated their efforts on ergonomics and on improving the non-stick coating, I might have remained a loyal customer.  Enter OXO. For years, I have been amazed at their ability to take the simplest of kitchen utensils and apply the basics of ergonomic design with results that are frequently astounding. Now, they’ve added non-stick skillets to their repertoire. To be concise: wow—just wow. The OXO skillet takes the best qualities of Calphalon and AllClad skillets and adds their usual human-friendly touch. The resulting skillet is heavy enough to ensure even and thorough browning but light enough to allow even a child to sauté with aplomb. Plus, the angle and depth of the edge is perfect for sauté. They’ve also added a PFOA-free non-stick coating that—after several months—still looks and works like new. Last night I seared yogurt-marinated chicken, laden with spices—most notably turmeric. The next morning, the skillet wiped out with a minimum of soapy water. Even burned spices wipe out and leave no residue. As an added bonus, the handles of the skillet and of the lid are clad in silicon.  OXO, you rock."
"Cooks Illustrated recommended the 12"" version of these pans. I didn't need another 12"" skillet but I had worn out the nonstick coatings on my two smaller skillets so I bought these and they are great. Really nonstick and easy to keep clean. I should have bought them sooner rather than struggling to scrape things off the old ones."
"No joke, this thing is the best bang for the buck! It's also the best that I could find. As long as you treat it right, never overheat it empty oh, and also always use at least a drop of oil every time you use it, this thing will treat you right for a lifetime.  A couple tips, one being that you should never store this thing with anything else inside of it. A lot of times, you're reaching around trying to grab something that's inside of it, and that could damage the coating. So just store it on its own oh, even on its side, making sure that nothing touches the surface with a sharp edge.  Okay, another tip is to either use wooden utensils, or silicone utensils. Never use metal utensils inside of it. Never cut into a steak inside of it with a sharp knife for instance.  The last thing I'll say is that even though it is nonstick, I always use at least a drop of oil in it, if not a tablespoon of butter, or something similar."
"So this is a great pan, ATK got this one right. But if your newly cleaned skillet is left on the counter & a VERY naughty kitty knocks it to the floor with malice aforethought, the pan will get bent up & the lid will no longer fit even tho the lid survived the floor trip like a pro. We were able to use the 'beat it to fit' method with a rubber mallet & get it pretty close to true, but not sure if that's really gonna be a long term fix - will have to see after using it a few more times. Also, not everyone considers a rubber mallet a necessary accoutrement for cat ownership even tho it totally is.  Really, cat? Really?"
"This is similar quality of egg/omelet pans we used in the hotels where I used to cook, or so it seems so far. Only time will tell how long the coating lasts but it looks like multi-coated and good quality, while the design of the curvature of the edge and lip are correct for tossing/sauteing and flipping one-handed, with no steep curvy ridges, gimmicky bumps or other stuff some companies do to their pans. Bottom of pan is solid and thick enough but not too thick (too thick takes too long to heat up a saute pan; thicker bottoms are best on saucepans & dutch ovens), while handle is solidly and correctly riveted (not spot-welded). And because the bottom is not too thick, it's not too heavy either to handle.  I've made omelets, over-easy eggs, quick stir-fry, and French toast with it so far with just a drop of oil, nothing sticks, and the handle is well designed for comfort and grip, and heating is even (on my gas stovetop; I think would be good on electric or induction, too). I'm going to also order an 8"" for single & over-easy eggs (easier to flip one-handed) and for cooking/finishing smaller dishes in my countertop oven, since this won't fit in there (handle on this 10"" one is a couple inches too long). I have a Hamilton Beach oven which is very large, so doubtful this pan would fit in most other toaster/countertop ovens either with the door closed. Would recommend to anyone pro or home cook."
"Just got these 3 weeks ago and I am in love with them so far. They are a very sturdy pan, the handle is comfortable and stable - rubber shrink fit on to the handle. These look great, cook evenly, are wonderfully non-stick, and clean very easily. I am previously a loyal All-Clad pan user, but realized that non-stick pans do not need to cost a grip to be good. Oxo consistently makes great products. I highly recommend."
"Let me start by saying I have gone through almost EVERY main-stream brand of non-stick pans over the years. From T-fal to Calphlon, from Circulon to Analon....I have thoroughly tested the Granite ""stone-ware"" type pans to the most advanced titanium-impregnated ceramic composites...and I can safely say that after several years of real-life every day use, none of these hold a candle to good old Teflon for durability and true non-stick performance over the long haul. Now, admittedly, you cannot expect ANY teflon pan to give you anymore than say 2 years of stellar performance, That being said, I would opt for the best pan (or pans for the buck. The 2-pan set from OXO gives you the following: a Hard anodized exterior; ergonomic handles; lots of surface area; low sides for easy access. ergonomic handles (OXO is particularly good at offering well balanced, ergonomic products of high quality); and 3 coats of durable Teflon; and at a great price. So far these pans are working beautifully. If I can squeeze a good 2 years out of them, then economically, this is a phenomenal deal. I let you know if these pans stand the 2-year test-of-time."
"This is just a very nice frying pan. If you like to cook and have worn out the starter pans you got at a big box store, treat yourself to one of these. I also have some other decent pans, this one is right in there with some more expensive makers for fit and even heating. Once you have used decent quality pots and pans you don't want to go back to the $80 for 7 pots and pans with lids in a big box level of quality ever again. You can get fairly decent browning in this pan even though it is non stick, but if your desire is to build thick crunchy outer layers on food none of the non-stick pans will get you there. It's made patty melts, plain old fried eggs, scrambled eggs, omelets, and fried asparagus over the last couple of weeks and worked well for all of these."
"I almost decided not to buy these skillets because of the negative reviews with regard to packaging/shipping, non-flat bottoms and out-of-round pans. I am glad I went ahead and ordered the pans. I agree that the packaging could be better, both with respect to the OXO packaging and the Amazon packaging for shipping. My pans arrived without damage, but they might easily have been damaged by rough handling or if they had been boxed with heavy items. It is not clear whether the out-of-round reports referred to shipping damage or manufacturing inadequacy. However, I measured the diameters of both pans at several angles and they are round within the accuracy of my ruler (1/16""). I used a straightedge to check the flatness of the bottoms, and discovered that the bottoms are slightly concave. This surprised me, so I checked the bottoms of the T-FAL pans I am replacing and three other pans, all of which I have used for years. They also are concave by about the same amount. I had never noticed. I wonder if the bottoms of skillets deliberately are designed to be concave so they will sit flat on a glass or ceramic cooktop without rocking. In any case, when cooking an omelet, these OXO pans appear to heat evenly and well on my glass cooktop. I can't speak to durability, since the pans are new. The non-stick surface of the OXO pans have more texture than the older pans I use and I was somewhat concerned that they might not be quite as non-stick. However, they definitely are better than the older pans, which probably have degraded over the years. The sides of the OXO pans have a nearly vertical section near the top edge and the transition from the bottom to the sides is more abrupt than the T-FAL pans I am replacing, which is good. The sides of the T-FAL pans never get to vertical and the transition is very gentle. I found I could not use the T-FAL pans for things like spaghetti sauce or browning hamburger for tacos, because it is too easy to slop food out of the pan. I always used pans with an almost square transition to vertical sides for preparing such foods. From the limited use I have made so far with the OXO pans, I think they will work better, although I suspect I will continue to use pans with relatively high vertical sides."
"I was tired of going through so many non-stick pans and decided to try this one. Have it almost 2 years and it looks and functions like new. Use it on low to medium gas heat and wash it out with soap and sponge only with no scrubbing ever needed. I bought the 11"" griddle pan for French toast and grilled cheese and love it."
"I purchased this non-stick pan (with lid) to replace a high-end frying pan that was nearing the end of its life. I'd recommend this pan for anyone who is looking for a quality frying pan that won't break the bank  PROS -This pan has a good weight to it and the the handle feels pretty comfortable when you need to hold the pan over heat or pour contents out -So far, we've found that the heat distribution is pretty even -It's truly non-stick - no problems with eggs sticking to the pan -Fitted lid is very useful, as I didn't find many other pans that come with one  CONS -The outside of the pan can scuff/scratch easily, this might bother some people, but as long as the pan functions well, we don't mind -Should be washed by hand - this is true for most non-stick surfaces and will extend the product's life"
"Purchase Date (left to right): Dec 2018, Mar 2020, recently (Oct)  I picked these up after reading the review on Cook's Illustrated. In no way do I abuse these pans - only plastic utensils are used, the temp limits aren't exceeded, etc.  But as you can see, the PTFE coating, all three layers of it, still abrades. If ever get more than 9months out of one these it would be amazing.  Since these are readily warped thru mishandling, Amazon routinely sells them at a discount if you can stand the imperfection. The middle and right examples have this feature and were obtained for $20 and $30 respectively. I would not pay full price for these ever again because they don't last. But for dishes with acidic components that would remove the patina from my high carbon stainless pans, there is no substitute. If you the reader knows of one, please comment!"
2 months then the non-stick coating peeled off. this is a garbage product.
"I bought my first OXO skillet b/c of an America's Test Kitchens review. I agree with the show's assessment of this skillet as super efficient in every respect - from cooking to cleaning. Nonstick coatings don't last forever, but at less than $50, I don't mind replacing it every year or two. I do not limit my use of cooking utensils to nonstick approved; I'm sure the nonstick coating would last longer if I did. I use this pan most every day, including for stir fry dishes a couple times a week. It's the only inexpensive skillet I've owned that consistently heats evenly and has never warped. You can buy a slightly more expensive pan that is oven safe - I haven't needed to have that option so I'm staying with the less expensive OXO skillet."
"I love OXO products and have never had an issue with them. When I needed a pan to replace my Calphalon non-stick, I knew to look at OXO. I even saw this one on “America’s Test Kitchen” and it was given great reviews. However, after having this pan for less than a month and only using it @1-2 times a week, it has several scratches. I wash it with a paper towel, as recommended, and let it air dry on a mat. This was not a cheap pan, especially for a recently retired person learning to live on a pension! I would like a replacement, but not sure if the same issue will happen again. If I buy another brand, what company can I trust? Did the best I could with the pictures. If you zoom in, you can see the scratches better."
"My GF and i decided to splurge and get like $800 in all clad. It’s amazing stuff but frankly for a fry pan the cleaning is out of control. So we decided to have a reasonably priced non-stick and just recognize we’d need to replace it every year or so. Well i am happy to report after 6 months this plan is our “go to” and frankly don’t see it needing to be replaced any time soon. It’s really a thoughtful design with good choice of materials. Not as pretty as my $800 all clad, but hey it really works well."
"I had done some research, looking for a nonstick but also non-Teflon pan. This one was identified in several product reviews as highly rated. I especially liked the price and the OXO brand is pretty strong. I have many other products by them in my kitchen. I have now had it for several months and it is now my go to pan for just about anything that I’m not making a sauce with later. It heats evenly and cooks up easily. I am following the care instructions and not using spray oil, that’s not a problem, it’s just different from how I have been cooking. Eggs have been just like in any of the infomercials. They slide in and out with very little added fat. I can finally make omelettes that don’t turn into oopses as I plate them. It browns and sautées well. I can throw a bunch of ingredients in and layer flavors. I don’t get anything from the nonstick coating flavor wise. It’s still really easy to clean. I haven’t had to work at anything, no matter what I’ve cooked. The only drawback is they recommend hand washing. I’ve done that exclusively and it’s as slidey today as when I opened it up. I highly recommend this. What a great nonstick pan."
"I am baffled by negative reviews of this pan. I bought it 18 months ago and it is the best non-stick frying pan I have ever used.Once I saw how it performed, I bought it in 2 other sizes as well. The 10 inch version is subjected to twice daily use in our kitchen and has held up impeccably. We use wooden and silicone utensils, wash by hand and these pans far outperform others I've purchased for far more money. I am in my 50s and have cooked for many decades. This pan holds up to daily egg or meat prep by my college age son who doesn't limit himself to medium heat and isn't easy on kitchen tools."
"I needed a new non-stick pan after trying 2 ceramic ""non-stick"" pans that both required way too much upkeep and still had food sticking to them. When I saw that this OXO pan was the winner of ATK's review of non-stick pans, I knew I had to purchase it.The first one arrived dented so badly the lid could not fit on it, as there was zero padding in the boxt, but Amazon refunded me and I purchased a second one. I made sure to order other items so that the box would not be empty and that maybe some padding would be added. Sure enough, box arrived with padding and the pan was undamaged.  The pan itself heats evenly and the lid fits nicely. I like that there are no steam holes in the lid, to keep as much moisture in as possible. And of course, it's an absolute dream to clean. I never use metal utensils and I never heat my non-stick pans higher than medium or medium-high, so I expect this pan to last me many years."
"It is hard to find frying pans that work on a glass top stove. If there is even a small high point in the bottom the pan heats nonuniformly and it spins on that spot. Second is the problem of a non-flat interior where oil, eggs, and other foods slide to the outside edge of the pan. Thankfully, this pan has remedied both of these problems. The pan sits squarely on the burner. The contact is so good I had to adjust the heat settings down from what I normally use. And when I placed eggs in the pan they stayed right where I placed them without even a hint of wanting to move to the outer edge of the pan bottom. Wow! I was surprised. I never expected a pan to be flat both on the outside and the inside."
"After ridiculous amounts of time researching, I am so, so glad I decided on this pan. Especially for the price point!  The size is generous enough for my favorite stove-top recipes, and the non-stick surface is holding up beautifully (we do take care of it). Unlike a pricier brand I bought some time ago (big mistake), the rubberized part of the handle does not twist around in my hand when lifting, which was really pretty dangerous.  And it is weighted very nicely, with a very even cooking surface. It's heavy-duty enough to stand up to lots of use, yet also light enough that it's easy to hang on my overhead pot rack. My only quibble is that I wish it had come with a matching cover.  Other than that, it is my favorite skillet, maybe ever!"
"I have gone through my share of supposed non-stick pans. I saw these being tested on a PBS cooking show and they were tested alongside other well-known frying pans. The Oxo-grip pan won and was best rated. I bought one set and they have done so well that I purchased a second set. They cook evenly, the handles do not get hot when using on the stove-top and they can go in the oven. Of course, you do need a potholder for the grips when used in the oven. These pans actually wipe clean!!! It takes no time to wash them and I actually enjoy cooking with them. The non-stick finish does not flake off and they have held up through all my cooking/baking needs. I would be really happy if lids were provided, but I repurposed lids from an old set of pans and they work fine. I would highly recommended these pans if you want a non-stick product that actually lives up to the hype."
"After watching a video from America's Test Kitchen on the best nonstick skillet, OXO came out on top. They tested 7 pans under $60. So I decided to give them a try. I bought this 12inch one, a 10 inch, and an 8 inch. I agree with the video reviews. OXO makes a great skillet. Nothing sticks to them! It has 3 layers of nonstick coatings, is lightweight, with a comfortable silicone handle that is oven safe. I haven't tried it yet in the oven, but I've had many burns taking skillets out of the oven with a mitt, but then forgetting how hot the metal handle still is from the oven when adjusting the pan on the stove top. So silicone handle was a priority for me. I also don't put these skillets in the dishwasher as it is not recommended. Overall, I love my OXO skillets!"
"Best sort of cheap pan out there. Super slick, and stays that way. I have an Alclad Teflon pan set for five years that still works perfectly. This pan is 1/3 the price and seems to have just as great a surface. While these pans are lighter than the Alclad and probably hold slightly less heat, they work perfectly for my non-professional use.  The only thing I’d change would be the silicone grips. I prefer a pan that I can slide into the oven, apparently this one can’t go in past a certain temp. Not a deal breaker, because I have other pans I can use for that, and the slickness of this Teflon is freaking amazing.  Finally, my son is 14 and just learning how to cook. These pans are great for him. Easy cleanup, forgiving surface, and I don’t pull my hair out when he uses a bread knife to try and flip an egg.  Get it!"
"After using a cheaper frying pan from Target that lasted less than 2 years, I feel this pan is definitely a step up without being too expensive. Not sure how long the non-stick material will last but it definitely looks and feels higher quality. The handle is comfortable and solid without causing any concern of it becoming loose over time. Also this pan is oven safe (although only up to 390°F), which was a surprising feature considering the comfortable handle material. Definitely nice since it is way lighter than a cast iron pan."
"I love my new pans. I use the smaller one for a wide variety of tasks (saute, eggs, small portions) the the larger size is perfect for 3 egg omelettes. The later is hard to find, everything seems to large to too small. The last pan I bought (and paid more for it) warped and the non-stick degraded quickly. This one seems to be exactly what I was looking for so much I am buying the set for my Mom who also makes her own omelettes and could use nice pans. They are not lightweight but they are not heavy either so I only gave it 4 stars on lightweight"
"I was watching reviews on line when this pan was reviewed and found to be the ""suggested purchase"" by the reviewer. I like the blog I was watching and decided to buy this pan. I was very pleased with the weight, design and size of the pan. I is very non-stick, heats well, although I find that the distribution of heat over the full bottom of the pan isn't perfect, I feel the electric stove I have is not up to par and isn't the best, so I can easily blame the stove for the problem. In the end, I am very pleased with the pan and recommend it. I also purchased the glass lid made by Lodge that fits over this pan perfectly."
"This is my favorite pan ever. The 8"" size is extremely convenient for cooking up small batches of things, like scrambling eggs, roasting nuts, or softening vegetables. I bought this to replace my old 8"" OXO fry pan and like this one better. The pan has a good weight to it and, unlike the previous model, the silicon handle appears to be securely fastened to the pan handle. The nonstick interior gets the job done, as along as you protect it by using only plastic/silicon utensils. The exterior has a brushed finish, which looks very sharp. Very happy with this product!"
"These seem to the be the best non-stick pans I have ever used.  These pan are not the ordinary pans you usually see hanging in the store. Those are complete waste of material and time and my money. These are well engineered and the coating is a German innovation. There are 4 things every non-stick should have; 1) a FANTASIC NON STICK coating, not just a good coating. Eggs do not stick ever. 2) a heavy construction so that sit flat on every kind of burner. 3) a riveted, heat isolated handle. 4) Lids. (unfortunately oxo does not make a lid for these).  3 out 4 is not bad. America's Kitchen did a great job on the review of this non-stick skillet. It was everything they said and more. It is not recommended to be cleaned in the dishwasher, but you can."
"I bought this because of a recommendation as the top omelette pan from America’s test kitchen! It does not disappoint! After having spent $50 on a ceramic pan from Calphalon that wouldnt sir down on my stove, d… I was really pleasantly surprised that this pan for $18 towed the load!!! Somebody mentioned in a comment that the nonstick disappeared I’ve had it so far for about two months nothing has happened to mine in for that money you could replace it easily enough!  It sits very nicely on the grates of my gas stove, Hasa nice thick silicone handle, And nothing seems to stick! I am very very happy with it for the price! Excellent product"
"After seeing that ATK rated this 10"" skillet their number one pick I really wanted one to replace, or at least be in addition to, the one I had which, tho satisfactory, was toooo heavy. Also the outside of the skillet could NOT be cleaned and was a mess. This OXO is perfect in those regards. It's the perfect weight to both handle easily and to fry things evenly. Nothing sticks to the outside of the skillet and it's easily washed with no residue. I am really enjoying this pan and am so glad I finally got it."
"This skillet is to replace an OXO pan just like it bought about 6 years ago. With nearly daily use, I think the non-stick coating did a wonderful job. The ""non-stick"" was getting spotty. I ordered a replacement. This ""used"" frying pan, with all of the ""factory"" packaging looks absolutely untouched and factory-fresh. I saved about $7.00. The pan may have taken a day or two extra to arrive, fine w/ me. The old pan is still serving, with a just a little sticking....but still works just fine. Yes, consider these second choice frying pans, and save some dollars."
I really like this pan. The nonstick works well. It cleans up easily and the flat area of the pan is very big for its size. It works well for wet sauteing vegetables and making pancakes. Enjoy.
"I chose this pan because of a review from a respected site/TV show (America's Test Kitchen) and the Pro model was recommended due to the weight (lighter than most) etc. This is just like it except it cannot go into an oven over 400; the pro has a higher temp due to the all metal handle. It flat inside the bottom, which my copper pan was not. It cooks, carmelizes, browns, and saute's really nice. For this price, I will replace it in about 2-3 years, as that is as long as any nonstick coating will last, according to my research. I highly recommend this pan for any level of cook!  I only use silicon utensils in it, except for once I used a metal whisk gently for sauce and it held up great to the whisk."
"I've been through any number of non-stick pans, and these are by far my favorite. I've had them over a year, and there is virtually NO sign of wear. Handles are great. No noticeable hot spots. Pan surface wipes clean most of the time and comes really clean after some warm soap and water after more messy cooking. Small pan is perfect for two eggs. Larger one is perfect for 3-4 chicken breasts, but if you need more room, consider upsizing. I have a number of All-Clad stainless pans that I use often, but for the quick weeknight meal, the OXO pans are the ticket. I don't see any need for a big-ticket, non-stick upgrade, especially these days when they will all eventually wear out, so this way you can get some good use out of them and replace them down the road for a bargain compared to other brand name non-stick pans."
"I had an A-C teflon coated frying pan and it was great, until a house guest took metal utensils to it. Alas, I wasn't going to spend the money again and Cook's Illustrated gave this pan great marks as the best bargain out there. They were right; for the money this pan is way beyond expectations and stands up well when compared to its more expensive rivals."
"I purchased my set of OXO 8"" and 10"" frying pans in February 2021. I have used them daily for the past 3 to 4 months for my cooking purposes (eggs, sauces, vegetables, meats, fish, poultry, etc.). The heat distribution is very even despite the fact that my old, natural gas stove burners are uneven in their heating distribution.  If by accident I become distracted and leave a food item in the pan too long so that the cooked item eventually becomes burnt, the pan still cleans exceptionally well. I take care that I do not use any type of abrasive tool or cleaning compound to clean their interior cooking surfaces. Just soap and water with a sponge works very well.  I just wish i could clean the exterior metal surfaces of the frying pans as easily or as well. Those exterior surfaces consist of metal alloys that do not contain the non-stick compounds from which the interior surfaces of the pans are coated with. So the exteriors of the pans require a lot more effort to clean without the same level of satisfaction.  Other than the issue of cleaning the exterior surfaces of the pans being more time consuming, these OXO frying pans have been an excellent product for cooking with. They are the best frying pan products that I have owned for cooking purposes so far. I am grateful that these pans allow me not to use teflon-coated frying pans to cook with anymore."
"this is my first non stick pan which i bought on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen video on You Tube. I am sort of amazed of just how non stick this pan is, eggs just float over the surface...even after fully cooked. clean up with hot soapy water is about 30 seconds to accomplish. i use the blue scotch brite non scratch pads but i could probably just use a paper towel because there is nothing left in the pan after cooking. it is stated they are not good for high heat cooking as in searing steaks or chops but my nice stainless steel pans do that just fine."
"After reading the directions, watching infomercials and shopping channels for non stick cookware, I saw that the keys to successful usage are wiping down with a clean dry cloth, avoiding anything abrasive when cleaning, keeping the heat at medium or below and wiping down the cooking surface with a tiny bit of oil (no aerosol sprays!). With those precaution, this cookware has been perfect. Heavy for heat distribution. Non stick surface great."
"I bought this pan because America's Test Kitchen said it was the best. And they are right. Non-stick pans, no matter how good never really stay non-stick longer than 6 months. I tried a lot of them over the years. $200 pan? 6 months. $20 pan? Hit or miss. Sometimes the really cheap ones suck right off the bat. So finding a non-stick pan that is both not expensive but not cheaply coated is tricky. I trust ATK's judgment. And I do love this pan. I just wish it was round. It's a new product. It shouldn't have any defects. But sending it back is a pain in the ass, and it's not like the pan is unusable. And besides, when the non-stick stops working, I'll just buy another one. Hopefully, that one will be round."
"My husband left a non-stick, heat-resistent spatula (which we'd had for over 20 years), in the empty, middle-sized pan and forgot to turn off the burner. 1 1/2 hours later, the spatula was melted ONTO the skillet! He let it naturally cool down ... and low and behold, the entire spatula popped off the surface, WITH NO DAMAGE to the pan. Not a mark! Not a difference in non-stick surface. The pan is back in daily use with nary a problem. I am so very pleased! The sizes of all 3 pans are great. The only thing that I wish, is that corresponding lids were available. I totally recommend these pans."
"After watching two America's Test Kitchen reviews and comparisons, I bought this pan as it was the best performing nonstick pan. After a few uses and cleanups, I can safely say that they were right - this is the best nonstick skillet I've owned. Nothing sticks, and it is very wide and flat to maximize cooking area (note that the sides aren't super high so you can't put in a lot of liquid). We'll see how it holds up over time, but right now it is my go-to everyday pan."
"I bought this to replace my old pan and am so glad I chose this one and this brand. It is light weight enough to be easy to use without making your wrist tired, yet heavy enough to be a solid and durable pan. It has lived up to every claim they made about it. It is definitely nonstick, when I first got it, I had to be careful that I didn't cause the food to slide out of it. It cleans with ease. It is also durable; I have even used older medal spatulas and spoons in it with no problem and no scarring. A great buy."
"This is a response to the negative reviews about the cardboard ring that left a mark on the larger pan. Someone at OXO must have been listening as I received mine yesterday, 3/14/17, and there was a closed cell foam pad underneath the cardboard protecting the larger pan. Mine had no marring of the surface. The only other thing I can say is that they feel great in the hand. Will see how they cook, but I am hopeful for greatness!"
"We read several reviews of these pans, including the reviews from America's Test Kitchen, who found thee to be the best non-stick pans on the market and after purchasing them and getting a chance to use all three sizes several times, we couldn't agree more. Great heat distribution and retention, and super easy to clean. We have been careful not to test the scratch resistance yet. We make eggs, bacon, breaded chicken, sautéed vegetables, pancakes, anything that is best cooked with medium heat in these pans and everything has come out delicious! We've been through all of the bargain brands. These were slightly more expensive, but they are worth every penny."
"This is a great non-stick pan. I had been using (and loved) one with the Emeril label that was actually made by All-Clad. That served me well for many years, but it has become increasingly hard to clean. So it's now less than non-stick. This OXO pan has a slicker-feeling finish, and was America's Test Kitchen's top choice. I can see why. Heats fast and evenly, it is truly non-stick, and yet it still gives things a nice crust (e.g., halved Brussels sprouts come out tender enough--I steam them a few mins before browning them--but with a nice dark brown crust on the cut side--yum!). It's now my go-to non-stick skillet."
"Upon arrival I was requested to do a review of this pan. I've waited to do the review until I have had an opportunity to cook with this pan. Works great. I have cooked steak, fried bacon and sausages, made pancakes, omlets, scrambled eggs, cooked fish, sauteed onions and mushrooms, everything I've cooked in this pan has come out as good as I'm able to cook food. Easy to clean. I have not experienced any of the problems the negative reviews have described. I like it. Update: I've continued to use this pan and have am very pleased with the performance. Still works great, cleans easy."
"After buying one cheap 12"" pan and one expensive porcelain one that I hated I finally went to Oxo, a brand I trust. Although a little pricey it is definitely cheaper than continuing to buy ones that need replacing! I love this pan - solid and won't warp. Heats well and evenly, with good stay cool handle. Seems like a decent fry pan shouldn't be so hard to find but it is. Also, the teflon coatings they use now for this are PFOA free!"
"I saw these pans win a contest on America Test Kitchen so I bought three of them. They work as demonstrated on the show. I do have a problem with maintenance though... they must be hand washed, which is ok, but they are getting stained on the bottoms and that's not ok. I hang my pans, they look dirty with stains, so I'm not happy about that. I haven't checked as to what I can use that may remove those stains. Otherwise they cook great and I recommend them. Just hide them after washing."
"If you use this pan correctly, use olive oil on it, and do not abuse it with scratching utensils it will provide lengthy good service. Its best for moderate to low heat. Rapid overheating, use of metal utensils, or placing cold items in it when it is hot will shorten the useful life. When treated with a thin layer of olive oil eggs easily slip around. I cleans nicely with soapy water and a blue sponge. I gave it three stars on scratch resistance because it can be damaged by abuse."
"Good quality fry pan. The aluminum base is thick enough to distribute heat evenly and hold heat when food is put in it. But not too heavy to handle or too long to heat up. Handle is excellent and overall the pan is very balanced. I use this every day and with that kind of heavy wear the non-stick finish lasts about 2 years. It says you can put in dishwasher, but I always hand wash - which is quick and easy with the non-stick finish. This is the 2nd one I've purchased after using the previous one about 2 year.s"
"I needed to replace some ""old"" worn out pans and I chose these. Very impressed with fit and finish and nonstick, they cook like a dream and they are just the right size. They are so nonstick you need to be careful the item you are cooking can slide right out of the pan! I am VERY pleased with these pans and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone or to purchase them again in the future."
"We have gone thru so many Calphalon pan sets - we trusted the brand name but were disappointed. We ordered this duo set of OXO good grips frying pans - and although they aren’t dishwasher safe, I have been extremely satisfied with this product. Truly non stick, easy to hand wash, good price and nice handle, doesn’t chip and makes our cooking experience much more pleasant than any calphalon pan yet. I’ll be purchasing more OXO pans going forward."
"I like that these pans feel comfortable in my hand and by that I mean the handles are long enough to leverage against weight, they are shaped to grip comfortably and they do not get too hot to handle. I also enjoy the easy clean-up... I use a gentle scrubbing sponge and dish soap on pots and pans and cleaning these OXO pans is a breeze. I think they look very nice too. The only drawback I found was that they scratch very easily... I made a mistake and used a fork to turn food and sure enough... even a gentle stroke with the fork left a scratch across the bottom. It's not a disaster but, that sort of thing wouldn't happen to my more expensive pans but, the difference in price is to be taken into account. All in all... I'd recommend these to all my girlfriends."
"We use these pans for frying and scrambling eggs, sauteing onions and garlic and numerous other uses. They are fantastic. They heat rapidly and evenly and retain the heat very well. They feel good in your hands. The handles never get hot and they are long enough to easily lift the pans without being too long and rubbing on the underside of your arms. Definitely recommend these frying pans."
"I have used these 3 times now for making omelets. Each time has been fantastic. They cook great and require very little to no oil or pam. Now, I only needed to go up to medium heat or just a tad over. Don't want to burn out the non-stick. Some pans can ruin if used on too high of heat.  UPDATE: I got these on May 18th and it is now June 22. These pans are still going strong. I don't even need to add oil or PAM as the Non-Stick is fabulous. I take care of them though. I don't use heat much over Medium, not needed. They get hot enough. I also wash by hand and use a wood or hard plastic spatula. So far, no scratches, chips or anything bad. I love these pans. I want to see if I can buy a larger one to go with these."
"I used this for about a week now. Fantastic non-stick pan and well worth the $40 (12"" model). I use it complement my two All-clad D5 Stainless Steel pans. I use OXO for making eggs and anything that doesn't require high heat. Pan surface is flat (unlike many of the T-fal models!) so the food doesn't bunch up near the edge. Handle is typical OXO: really good, comfortable and great to hold. The outer surface feels very smooth and the pan is not too heavy (but definitely feels solid). For cleaning I just wipe the pan with a paper towel. The attached photos show how the pan looks like after frying ~ 10 eggs and wiping it with a paper towel.  In case you're on the budget I would still recommend this pan. I used many cheap pans as well (Ikea brand and basic T-fal) and there is just no comparison. It's a night and day difference that you'll get for a little more money."
"I've only used the pan for about a month. It is one of 4 and I only use it when I need the extra large size. It has performed to my expectations completely. It is still too new to assess the durability of the non-stick surface but I placed the order based on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen and I trust their opinions implicitly. Much of my cooking involves heating oil mixed with chili powder and minced garlic. That resulting residue is a good test for what normally would be a difficult cleanup. While cleanup takes a bit of work, the pan ultimately comes completely clean with no apparent damage to the surface. It is a favorite and I expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future."
"I bought this nonstick pan because I wanted to practice making French Omelettes and they said that you need a goo good non stick pan. After looking around on Amazon I decided to get this one. It works really well and the non stick coating allows you to cook things without them sticking. Cleanup is a breeze as well. I simply wipe down the pan with a soapy sponge and that's all there is to it!! It's a really good pan but I noticed that it began to show scratches on the surface. We are very careful with it so we never use metal utensils when using it but I noticed that the surface is prone to show scratches very easily. I'm not sure if this will affect performance in the long run but I had to mention it. Overall, this is a great non stick pan."
The absolute monster of frypans. I bought the biggest one they make. Its the size of a toilet seat. I can put half the food in my refrigerator in this pan at one time. Its deep so hardly no splatter on my stovetop when Im going to town on chicken breasts sizzling in olive oil. Non stick surface is a dream come true. Pre treat the surface according to instructions and start with low heat. Nothing will ever trash the surface. The handle is stylish and matches the lid knob. The lid is as big as a hubcap from a 1967 impala. This massive pan is a joy to cook with and ill never use a tiny 10 inch pan again. I'l be buying matching pans soon as i fullu vet this one. Was 50 bucks and change out the door. Buy one and you'll soon be buying more sizes. Best purchase of 2021.
"All the reviews said not to heat on high. It never was hot enough for my dishes. I really think that depends on your stove. The burner on our glass top Jenn Aire does not get as hot as others I've used. I tried preheating at medium high. Nothing ever seared at all. I now hear it on high until it reaches the temp I need then turn down to 8. Works fine every time. I haven't put it in the dishwasher, is so easy to wash. Not sure about scratch resistance as I don't use metal utensils. I make breakfast for dinner, sausage in one pan, fried potatoes in this on medium high, after parties are done I drop in scrambled eggs, while it's hot, done in about a minute. They wipe out every time. Hardly even need a sponge. THAT'S NON STICK. It's awesome."
"OK. hands down, that thing is great. We've only used it 3 times so far but we love it. So glad I didn't spend for a more expensive, familiar name brand. The lid is so easy to grab. The pull on it is wide and tall and feels good in the hands, like the handle. There is a post that says it has texture; I don't know what they are talking about. It is speckled but very smooth. There are not bumps in it. It is just the way it was painted, in a salt and pepper kind of look. Personally, I think it looks cool b/c it reminds of older pans but functions like a contemporary one."
"I really like this 8"" fry pan. Made a mistake with the 10"" (too big for intended use) but kept it because it is a very nice solid fry pan for the price. Looks to be very well made and has a bit of heft to it which I like. Heavy glass lid is a plus as well. Solid and secure handles on the pan and lid. Nice enough to take good care of and time will tell how long it performs."

"I am someone who spends time in the kitchen. I need to be familiar with all of my tools, utensils, and cookware. The acquisition of this little pan was an outstanding purchase. It disperses a uniform and consistent heat, with no ""hot"" spots anywhere across its surface. The non-stick quality is 2nd to none; I found the utensil more than easy to quickly clean. If you're looking for a decent, moderately priced piece of kitchenware, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Highly recommended!"
"This is one of the best pans we have had in a while. The pics are after two months of regular use. At this time, it is the only frying pan we have. We went with Rachel Ray’s pans and they were awful. We spent $199 on the Kirkland stainless steel set and wound up returning a week later because they were very very disappointing as everything stuck no matter what we did. This pan heats very evenly, it doesn’t stick at all whatsoever no matter what we cook. We have cooked anything from potatoes, chicken, hamburgers, eggs, bacon you name it. Very happy and just ordered their 12” deep frying pan with the lid today. It does have a few very minor scratches from being in the sink and tossing silverware in on top, our fault. We do not put it in the dishwasher and hand wash only. Using plastic or wooden cooking utensils works great."
"Great pan. I like the plastic wood feature it looks nice on the handle. It's also pretty lightweight and easy to manage. No matter what I cook only takes minutes to clean after; cooking and cleaning this pan takes no effort. Only thing is its a bit small. If you were to cook bacon in it for example could get probably 4 slices in the pan. I wound up buying a second larger pan as I need more space but the same brand because the product is really nice. Sometimes on amazon I feel like I wasted money because sometimes upon delivery there is some issue with items appearing used or damaged. But not in this case at least, this was worth the money."
"I always try to get the best bang for my money. These pans hit the mark. I first bought the smaller one and after significant use over the last two months, it still looks like new...even on the bottom. Food slides right off. So I bought the larger one and it's equally superb. Instructions say not to heat the pan without oil or butter and I followed this direction. Very happy with the purchases."
"It is a little heavier than the one I destroyed by letting the burner on, a little lighter than the 2 inch smaller cast iron one but that appears to distribute the heat better than either. The handle is solid and easy to hold. Overall, a great buy and it is non-stick."
"I am very pleased with this frying pan. I’m not a gourmet cook, just was looking for a non-stick pan that was non-Teflon. It is very solid, looks fancy, and easy to clean. Very non-stick. The lid is handy for some dishes, but little hole is not enough ventilation if you’re cooking a sauce you wanting to thicken. I put pan and lid in the dishwasher, no problem. It seems to me that heat is not perfectly uniformly distributed (things don’t brown exactly evenly), but a fussier cook would be a better judge."
"It is doing all a frying pan can. It does seem to be able to hold heat. Also it has a wood-look synthetic handle, which has also withstood being moved from the gas burner into the oven at 400 degrees without melting or burning my hand."
"This thing holds up better than any copper pan we’ve tried. And its huge, a bit heavy with tall sides. It really works minusall the “rules for use” that seem to come with the copper pan. Love it."
"I love the even heat cooking eggs and meat. I chose it because of the weight of the Pan , the nonstick surface and that a lid came with it. Win, win."
the pan works very well. it heats quickly and the nonstick surface is great with easy cleanup. Besides that the pan looks nice with the wooden handles.
I just received my new pan and already in love with it. The quality and thickness are amazing. Plus shipping was super fast. Love it! Thank you.
"I’ve had this skillet for about a month now, and it is awesome! It’s reasonably priced and is non stick! Love it!"
"We bought this to replace our copper frying pans that started out well enough, but over time everything started sticking to it. Cleaning became a problem. This pan works terrific & cleans up super easy. Love the soft touch handle also!"
"I have been cooking for many years and have gone through a lot of pans, this is the best ever non-stick and even heating. Get one !!"
Excellent pan for making scramble eggs and other cooking. It is not sticking. Recommended.
"Great skillet, great buy for the money. Heavy enough. Non stick, cleans so easy. We love it."
"5 stars, great pan - quality - even came with its own screwdriver to attach handle. Thanks !"
This little pan was the best present I gave my wife! She loves this pan! Small enough so it’s easy to use. Big enough to cook what she wants. Easy to clean and of course it’s non stick as long as you add butter or oil before frying. Overall a really good pan!!
This is one of the best pans we have ever owned. Has not warped even when over heated. Cleans up every time with simple paper towel and cold water. Worth every penny.
Great value .zit is a must have pan for any kitchen.
This pan is pretty good. Non stick. Eggs cook well and do not stick. I've cooked turkey bacon hot dogs fish sausage etc... Very easy to clean. It's good pan for the price.
This thing actually browns stuff. Some don't. Cleans up really easy. I would definitely recommend these pans.
Works great very easy to clean
Love this has a see-thru lid. Better that cleans so easily
I bought a few at the same time because ours were in bad shape. So far this is the family favorite-for not burning and for very easy clean up.
"I love this skillet. So easy to cook with, clean and nothing sticks."
I like it for frying potatoes and it cleans easily.
Love the handle on the pan. Perfect for gas stove where the handles tend to get hot. Perfect sauce pan.
Excellent product
Exactly what I was looking for. Very high quality.
This pan will cook anything! You don't need oil for eggs and the lid helps increase versatility. We also love the smaller size and the unique style.
Liked it so much we bought two other sizes
Have not had a chance to use it that much yet.
Nice finish. Good fitting lid.
Excellent
Good
"It’s beautiful, easy to clean, cooks really well, and came with its own screwdriver?! *chef’s kiss* A masterpiece!"
This small type of frying pan is what I have been searching for.
"I received my order and had two issues. The deep frying pan came with the handle broken into three pieces and the lid was bent and damaged in three places. It looks like someone thrashed it pretty well. The 2nd issues was with the 1.5 qt. sauce pan which has a three in crack in the bottom. I will be returning both of these products. I also ordered the large frying skillet, pancake pan and others. I used the pancake pan tonight for toasting buns and it cooked he buns very evenly. Haven't used them for anything else yet so I will have to update this at another time"
"This gorgeous skillet arrived right after a day that had me racking my brains about how the heck to assemble a swivel desk chair I had just bought in Amazon. It had NO instructions, and I finally had to ask my super to send up one of his staffers to figure it out. So when I opened the box with the skillet, I was amazed to find a Philips screwdriver the company had included, to drive in the one (included) screw used to attach the handle to the skillet. This is SERVICE! That is COURTESY! And it was certainly not lost on me. It was a complete antidote/Tikkun to the aggravation and frustration caused by the chair service people on the same day."
So far so good! My new favorite pan!
This is a very nice pan that heats even!y and cleans easi!y. I like the look of the faux wood pan and lid handles. Be sure to carefully read the instructions relating to use and care of the pan to avoid damage of the ceramic coating.
I love this skillet! Works great. Looks great. Love the wood grain handle and knob in the lid. I’m sad that I accidentally picked ups metal spatula and put a small scratch in it. So far it hasn’t caused a problem though. I definitely recommend this.
i purchased this skillet after using a smaller version for a little more than year. I expect to like this larger one as much as the small one. Definitely recommend.
So far this frying pan is great. The non stick is super slick and it washes off very easy. The heat distribution is a little slow but still a great pan.
Super attractive pan and love that it came with a lid. It's easy to clean and makes perfect eggs that slide right out of the pan. The size I got is perfect for cooking full meals. Love the color.
"The pan is well constructed, solid feel, heats up quickly and absolutely no stick!!! Cleans up in a moment. No-fuss, no muss."
We need to replace a few other pans like this and I love the wood handles and glass top.
Unable to fix handle to the pan. Waste of money. Don’t buy. Its not wood so the screw doesn’t hold.
It is so nonstick it is hard to tell if someone has cooked something in it.
Does exactly what they say it will do ... Recomended
Bought as a gift for my son and he loves it!
Would buy again
Title says it all. I do not regret spending the money I did to buy this skillet. Nothing sticks to it and SUPER easy to clean.
"I’ve had this pan for 1 month and so far, it’s wonderful! It’s very non-stick, is beautiful, is easy to clean, and even comes with a screwdriver to assemble the handle to the pot."
Perfect for my morning bacon and eggs !!
"What we discovered by purchasing and using this pan less than 1 week is incredible. We used nothing but plastic utensils in this and hung it separately and hand washed it. I noticed a huge scratch in it already. This is not intended to be a negative review instead a learning review. We tried to find out how this happened as we hand washed it and hung it in a way that nothing could scratch it. When we started figuring out how it happened we discovered our plastic utensils had melt spots on the underside of them and that is the only thing that could have scratched this new pan. So we threw out all of them that had melted spots and now going to trust that it will be fine. We now believe our other coated pans were scratched the same way. It really is hard to believe that this happened to pans that are supposed to be so hard to scratch. Bottom line.... check your plastic or coated utensils for sharp hard spots, you will probably be surprised."
"I have an old, sad stove that makes pan frying almost impossible, but this pan is so smart! Heat distribution is excellent and it is soooooooo nonstick. It’s nice and lightweight, cleaning is a breeze"
This pan is phenomenal! It is the definition of non stick. Wipes clean and heat distribution is even. I love love love it! Will definitely be buying more of these pieces. Worth every penny!
Been looking for a frying pan nonstick this is the third and last time I was going to try to find what I needed at last this one does the trick it’s wonderful
Good skillet
This one make my cooking so much better and so easy to clean
Convenient size to fix my breakfast in. It suits me just fine.
Love it cooks evenly cleans great one of my favorite pans now
The best of the best!!!!👍👍👍
I did a lot of researching before purchasing a cookware set plus two additional pans. Many of the more known brands had several poor reviews for one reason or another. MSMK had really good reviews. I am an everyday home cook and so far this cookware has been great. I have only been using it a few days but I do like the heat distribution and the length of the handles (a little longer than most). As of right now I will highly recommend this product. Will update my review in a few months if anything changes.
I purchased this to prepare 1 or 2 pieces of salmon as needed. I am so pleased with the 7 inch I am thinking about purchasing an 8 inch. It's just the right size to prepare salmon for one or two people even if you're making a sauce with it.
"Just purchased it, so far, I am pleased. But most non-stick cookware is when first purchased. I am hopeful this will stand the test of time unlike many others. Very well made, heats evenly, easy clean up. Making sure to follow directions to ""season"" the pan and avoid cooking sprays. Will follow up in a few months..."
"Just want to add I never put my expensive non-stick cookware in the dishwasher, or use metal utensils. This pan cleans really quickly and easily. Everything I’ve cooked has come out fine."
"I bought this primarily for cooking omelettes. Does a really nice job at med heat but does add some time. Cleaning is easy with the exception of the rivets holding the handle an area that needs soaking and scrubbing, but that is nitpicking."
I have used this for a month now. It works very well. Dishwasher save and seems to be a very nice product.
I hope it’s durable.
Love it
Works well and is easy to clean. Highly recommended.
This is extremely versatile. Nothing sticks and we’ve used it for omellettes and a variety of other meals. With and without the lid. You can’t go wrong.
"Seems like a well-made pan, the nose stick works great but most pans do when they’re new, if this were a $30 pan I’d give it five stars but it’s a $90 pan and I expect a flat bottom, and it’s not, it’s domed like many other reviewer say, if you don’t mind this and spending $90 it’s a great pan, I expected more from this price point"
"This is a sturdy well-made non-stick frying pan. I love that it is 11” - 10” pans are sometimes too small and 12” pans are often hard to handle. The only issue I have is that it is sometimes difficult to clean around the bolts - food tends to stick there. But overall, a great frying pan."
I bought this to use in the oven and the heat distribution is excellent. My crustless quiche turned out beautifully. Do take care to turn the handle away from the edge of the stove after removing it from the oven as the handle will be extemely hot.
"This product looks to be fabulous. But I ended up returning it because it's just a bit too small for my needs. 7 inches doesn't let a small tortilla lay flat, for example. Perfect for 1-2 eggs."
"These pans are all they are said to be. Easy to use, clean and never does food stick. NEVER No matter how hard you try. My kind of pan!"
"I purchased this 7"" skillet along with a 1.5 Qt. saucepan for use on an induction stove. The skillet worked as advertised and was very easy to clean and was easy to cook with. However, the matching 1.5 Qt saucepan did not work on the induction stove even though it was advertised as compatable."
Nice balance. Easy to clean. Used only once so far. Hopefully the non-stick feature will hold its durability.
working as needed it
Single items warming up a small meal
It's a little heavy but I'm getting used to that and like it every time I use it.
Love it
Have not used long enough to state info on durability but really like this pan. So easy for fixing eggs.
"There is nothing wrong with the pan, For the price I just expected to be blown away but its just a good pan so far but nothing special."
"I got several of these MSMK non-stick pans in various sizes and configurations, mainly for the induction capability and ""commercial"" quality claims. We recently acquired a camper van with an induction cooktop and I wanted to try out some different shapes and sizes, to see what worked best. This 9.5"" frying pan is super versatile compared to some of the others. So it gets the most use. But the fact is, ALL these MSMK pans work really well for us. We've been using them daily for almost a month now and they have performed perfectly and held up well. Photos and comments will be similar for all of the pans I'm reviewing, since they are all equally good.  Interestingly, I'm not a huge fan of non-stick surfaces. They all start off great. But the cooking surface inevitably degrades quickly for whatever reason. We're always super careful not to overheat them, or scrape the surface, or use spray oils, etc. Yet most of the surfaces just don't last more than 10-15 uses. These MSMK pans have held up really well after a month of daily use. The cooking surface is just as slick and pristine as the day they came out of the box.  I can't really tell if these are ""commercial"" grade, whatever that means. But by comparison to our other non-stick pans, they definitely look and feel more solid and well made. The metal construction is noticeably thicker. Definitely thicker than your typical non-stick pan. The handles are hollow and stay cool to the touch. They are quite comfortable to use. The handle joint with the pan is riveted and indestructible. The pans heat up fast, retain heat well, and distribute the heat evenly. Yet they are remarkably lightweight and well-balanced in the hand. Very easy to use for a variety of tasks despite the heavy-duty construction.  We had planned to only use these in the van with the induction cooktop. But we liked them so much, that we now use them in the kitchen on our gas range. They also work great on our portable propane cooktop. Basically, the design and quality are miles ahead of our other non-stick pans.  All in all, there's a lot to like about these MSMK non-stick pans. They work well on induction or other cooktops. Heavy-duty build quality. Durable cooking surface. Retain and distribute heat well. The price-point is definitely a bit ""lofty"". But after a month of daily use, I can confidently say that these are among the best non-stick pans I've ever used."

"We had been using frying pans that were made with the copper finish and were told that they would last a long time. Well...that is not the case as we found several of the fry pans we had from only a year ago have become difficult to clean as things like fried eggs, with butter, still stuck to the bottom. Had to work hard to scrub them clean.  This pan is different...it take a modicum of Dawn in the bottom, run warm or hot water in and the pan comes clean when you rub easily with a sponge. The other night my wife fried some pork chops and they were great! Best part was when I went to clean the pan the next morning after it had sat overnight with the residue, it was when I put some Dawn in, hot water to follow, and then rubbed with a sponge. Clean as a whistle and down the drain when the residue.  Highly recommend and this also comes with a great lid!"

"This skillet has an incredibly slippery non-stick surface. My three photos show the pan after having fried falafel. The picture with the oil in the pan shows how nothing stuck to the pan. The falafel did not break apart as it has with other skillets I've used. The photo that looks clean and dry is what the skillet looked like after the oil had cooled and I had just quickly wiped it with a paper towel. Again, absolutely nothing sticking to the pan. Finally, after the skillet was washed, but not dried, the last picture shows how the surface is so slick that water separates into tiny drops.  The heat distribution was very even throughout the pan, making it easy to cook the falafel evenly. The steel handles make the pan oven safe up to 700 degrees, hotter than anyone ever cooks. The handle does not get hot to the touch when using the skillet on a stovetop burner. I'm in my 70s and have been cooking a long time. This is among the best skillets I've ever used. I can't recommend them highly enough."
"This is the second pan I have used from MSMK. They are really nice and deserve the price. They seem to last a decent length of time, although you cannot really expect a non-stick coating to last forever. It boasts being ""Free of"" lots of various acronyms which are toxic, such as PFOA, PTFE, and others. That is nice, but the fact that it has a nonstick coating means that there is some other chemical being used for which the acronym has not yet been called out publicly. I am not aware of a completely benign, non-toxic coating, so... Anyway, if you can tolerate that and keep the heat on the lower side it probably is fine. That aside, it is rated for 700F cooking and is a really solid and well-made pan. If you are looking for good quality cookware, this may be for you."
"The 7"" MSMK Pro Non-Stick Pan is a Professional, robust 7"" pan with an equally robust glass lid and handle. It has a diamond and titanium Non-Stick coating, and it works as designed. I cooked an egg in about 3 minutes, with perfect even cooking and very easy to flip with a plastic spatula. The Glass lid/cover is also extremely well made, with a nice, large handle and a vent hole. Also, the pan's handle doesn't get hot when cooking on a gas stove, and is very well-constructed. Both pan and lid are quite easy to clean, and the pan's handle is made of die-cast stainless steel, which is comfortable to grasp. I highly recommend the 7"" MSMK Pro Non-Stick Grey Series Pan!"
"Maybe it's just me, but I've had a mismatched set of pots and pans for years and it was time to get a nice, complete set. This skillet is one of a set that I purchased separately. I love this skillet - it's large enough when I make a double-decker hamburger I can get both (frozen) patties in the skillet as well as squeezing in the buttered buns to toast at the same time. Seems like lots of people don't cook much any longer - just stop at fast food places on their way home to pick up dinner. I prefer home cooked food - I know what's in it - I can control what goes in it and of course, it tastes and is made like I want it. Naturally, I also spend less money making food at home so with that savings, I got this really, nice skillet. What I really like about it is that it can be used on/in any cooking/heating source - electric or gas range, induction or radiant heat flat surfaces and will even go into the oven to finish off a recipe. Definitely a good skillet to have!"
"The truly non stick cookware has finally arrived.  It’s a smaller skillet with a higher sides and a tightly fitting glass lid. The lid fits so snugly, I thought it had a rubber seal on it. That’s how well it’s constructed.  I ran a most unscientific test. In my experience the hardest of anything to clean off of a cooking pot would be cheese grits. It’s like glue. Even the spoon to stir it makes most dishwashers run.  The first picture is after the cheese grits had dried on (not burned on). The second picture is simply brushing the spatula on it. It came right off. It stuck more to the spatula than anything else. This pan is in fact 100% stick-free in my opinion.  This pan is induction compatible which is great. Induction cooking is on the rise and it will save money (even if initially the cost is more) to buy cookware that can be used on such a cook top. This is truly a top of the line cookware."
"This is a Great little frying pan. This 7 inch frying pan is great for quick things Like eggs and such. I really Like that this frying pan has a lid as previous frying pan that I have owned of the size haven’t come with one , and the nonstick coating is pretty awesome. It’s really easy to clean and super durable too. Only thing I’m concerned about is the instructions ask that you don’t use these with high heat and that’s mostly how my family cooks because they want it done faster and to not use cooking sprays which might also be a problem. Hope these hold up."
"Right up front: I did not like this pan. I had a much more expensive Calphalon nonstick fry pan that had about lived its life after years and years of use. This pan didn't make it one week for me. The very first time I used it my fried eggs burned badly to the pan surface. I had the stove top on a medium heat and decided not to use any oil to see how good the nonstick surface really was; the answer was not good. The whites of the eggs immediately stuck to the surface and started peeling at the edges. I used a silicone spatula to try and dig under the burning egg whites to release them from the surface of the pan to no avail. I basically made messy scrambled eggs that morning. I immediately put the pan in the sink under running hot water and still had to use a thick scrub brush to even attempt to get the burnt egg off the surface. It was very difficult to clean the ""nonstick"" surface of this pan.  The handle on this pan is very uncomfortable to hold and to use to flip your food. It is way too squared off and angular. I included a side-by-side photo to the old more expensive Calphalon pan and you can see the comfortable curves of the Calphalon along with the dimpled surface that makes it very easy to hold. This product is very uncomfortable to hold and the squared off edges actually make it want to twist in your hand when you're picking the pan up to flip your food.  The 7"" dimension is slightly misleading even though they do have a picture of the 5"" base in their product description. The 7"" must be measured from the top edges where the lid fits because the surface of the base is only 5"". The other issue is that there is no slope to the 5"" base but a fairly angular curve to the base so the 5"" is a hard 5"". The angular curve makes it very awkward to get a spatula under the food.  At the time of this review this pan sells for $50. I cannot recommend this product to you at this price. I honestly wouldn't pay more than $20 for this pan. In fact, after my wife used this pan she was upset at me for getting it to replace the Calphalon pan and we decided to get rid of this pan and keep using the Calphalon until we can find a better replacement.  I hope this review was helpful for you."
"I was very excited to receive this pan. I own one pan in a larger size by this brand already, and when I saw an opportunity to snag another I jumped on it. I really like these anodized pans. they still sick and sturdy, but have a lightness to them I didn't expect. This is fantastic for me as I sometimes have issues with my arms and hands, so it's easy for me to lift their products . Despite the lightweight feel, this pan feels extremely sturdy & durable. It arrived with no chips or blemishes and has a lovely finish on the exterior.  This pan is the perfect size for a couple of eggs so that's the first thing that I made. I found at the surface to heat up quickly and evenly, and to the lid helped me make perfect over easy eggs in short order. The nonstick works extremely well, although the instructions did mention using a little bit of butter or oil to aid the nonstick surface. So far, the eggs slid right off.  My one serious gripe is that these pots and pans are marketed as dishwasher safe, but when I received the instructions they said that while you can technically put these in the dishwasher, you should avoid it. I may have still made this purchase anyway although I'm not certain, but I did find it to be really frustrating because it isn't what I expected to hear. I know that nonstick is usually not dishwasher friendly, but reading that **these** were dishwasher friendly was a big part of what got me so excited to purchase. I have some physical issues that make washing dishes hard for me, so I was looking to up my game in the kitchen by having dishwasher friendly non-stick pots and pans.  Overall, I'm happy with this order and MSMK are some of the higher quality pots and pans I have collected over time, but don't be expecting special features for a nonstick pan. At the end of the day these are high-quality non stick pans, but they still have the restrictions you'd expect."
"I find that I use an 8"", 10"" and 12"" skillet most often. This one is 9.5"", making it good for making omelets or things like that. The performance is good, probably because of the 4mm-thick seamless stainless steel bottom. It works with induction but I use it on a glass top electric. The non-stick coating is free of PFOA and can be heated to 700F. Overall, this is a nicely made pan that performs well in the kitchen."
"For its maiden voyage, I used this pan on a gas cooktop range for frying onions, and whipping up a nice cheeseburger for a hearty dinner. The heat was evenly distributed along the base. I was careful to not use the blazing heat the cooktop is capable of providing, as it is unnecessary for this type of cooking and may shorten the life of the pan.  I think the non-stick surface of the pan is well made. I found that the cooled cooking residue from cooking the cheeseburger wiped away easily; cleanup was a snap. Long term use will tell, however initial impressions is that it is durable and will hold up fine to careful use. I don't use metal items when cooking on non-stick, and I hand wash my pans.  The lid is well balanced and fits the pan well.  Overall, I like the pan and look forward to cooking with it. five stars."
"Awesome non-stick frying pan! I love the handle design and feel. The pot has a nonstick coating that has worked well with eggs, veggies, and bacon so far. Good even heat. Easy to clean up after…no sticking! The glass top has a steam release hole and a nice handle. I’m very pleased with the weight and quality of all of the MSMK pots and pans from this series. An excellent value. I highly recommend!"
"We got this 11 inch frying pan, which is packaged extremely well inside a beautiful presentation box with an extra inner liner which protects the pan very well and makes it really good for gifting. We cleaned it and seasoned it as the pan's instructions indicated. Something I immediately noticed, even before heating it up the first time was that the center of the pan is slightly bowed up. This means that anything liquid poured into it quickly runs to the outside edges of the pan. The lid is a great fit, neither too tight nor too loose. The pan itself is very heavy duty with very sturdy handles which feel securely attached to the pan.  The pan heats up well and maintains its heat with no hot spots. Meat easily gets a good sear on it. However its non-stick properties work best assisted by oil which isn't easy to apply to the center due to center bowing. Any oil put in the pan wants to run out to the edges of the pan. It's a dance of either using your spatula to tease some oil to the center or just dragging a piece of food through the oil to get some in the center. After use, clean up is a breeze. Everything washes off without effort using just a regular dishcloth. No scrubbing or abrasives required.  We've only used it a few times, but we are really liking it. However you won't be making pancakes or omelettes in it due to the bowed bottom. Other than this issue it is a good frying pan. For the price they are charging for this pan, currently $89.99, the bowed bottom absolutely shouldn't be there. It should be completely flat. Only time will tell how long the nonstick properties will last on it. At 2 to 3 times the price of more common priced pans, it had better last at least 3 times as long."
"Note: As I have gotten an entire set of this cookware and each item is a separate review, elements of this review will be recycled for those nearly-identical items. I shall customize where needed.  Now on to the review!  I use an induction cooktop. I consider it a game-changer in my kitchen, and I have no desire to go back to gas or electric heat. Induction is simply awesome. The only problem is that you need cookware that is induction-ready, and most of the lower-cost non-stick cookware out there isn't. It's usually aluminum or some other alloy, and it just won't work. So for the past several years I've been getting by with a nice but basic stainless steel set of pans. They worked fine for cooking, but cleaning them up was a bit more work, and occasionally I'd have to deal with food getting stuck while cooking despite using spray or oils.  So you can imagine my delight in getting these MSMK non-stick pans. They're gorgeous to behold, and food just slides off the surface easily. They work perfectly with my induction cooktop, evenly distributing heat and heating up just as fast as my plain stainless steel pans did. The pans come with glass lids, and I won't complain too much, but I do wish they came with metal lids simply because storage for glass is tricky and I've already had other pans in the past lose lids to breakage. Metal you can just pile up in a bin. Glass has to be carefully handled, even if it is tempered glass. Still, these glass lids are of high quality and they do the job. I'll just need to invest in lid storage, I guess.  And of course, being nonstick they're pretty easy to wash. A quick spray and rub and they're clean. Food doesn't stick, so there's no hassle.  This particular pan is the 7-inch small ""egg pan"", but it's also ideal for single items like a grilled cheese sandwich or a single burger patty. But of course, eggs turn out great in it, too.  I have hooks on the wall behind my cooktop and this pan hangs on it neatly, ready to be used at a moment's notice thanks to the sturdy handle with a hanging hole in the end. These pans need little maintenance aside from seasoning every once in a while, and gentle washing. You've gotta love that.  Bottom line: Amazingly nice cookware. I'm super-pleased. These should last a lifetime. Five stars!"
"This 7” pan is a handy size for cooking meals for one or two. You can do a couple of eggs, a burger, an omelette, that sort of thing. The non-stick surface works well. The maker says it’s tough and scratch resistant, and I’m inclined to believe them. The thick aluminum distributes heat well and should be resistant to denting and warping. A good choice for that first kitchen."
"First off, this cookware is a work of art. It's substantial, sleek and feels well balanced when handled. The lid sits confidently on top. Not too heavy, not too light. The lifetime guarantee is a welcome surprise.  The first thing I cooked in this frying pan was some chicken wings, which turned out perfectly. Clean up was spectacularly easy, it looked just as pristine after using and washing than it did when I took it out of the box. I have since cooked other items such as omelets, sausage, bacon, and tomato sauce in this pan. Heat distribution is excellent. Pan cleaned up with ease and still looks new.  Speaking of the boxes, these pans are packed very well in extremely substantial boxes that 'show' nicely. I would be proud to give these as gifts, the overall presentation (box and product) is extremely impressive.  While this line of cookware can be washed in the dishwasher, I have been hand cleaning. Honestly, it cleans so easily, that task is almost enjoyable in an of itself. Handling this cookware at every turn is a joy.  This cookware is not cheap. Having had the opportunity to use it, however, I am reminded once again of the old adage ""you get what you pay for"". This cookware makes cooking a pleasure."

"This is such a convenient size. The 7"" is great for a single fried egg or a good serving of scramble.  The non-stick feature is effective and my food lifts off completely clean. I love my eggs over-medium and the MSMK cooks them perfectly, evenly, and I can lift and flip without fighting any stick and breaking my yolk. For scramble I like to add a handful of grated cheese -- n0t even that sticks to the surface of this pan.  Clean-up is excellent -- very easy and leaves nothing behind.  These pans allow for healthier cooking too as you don't need to use as much, if any fat. I still add a little for flavor and texture.  The handle is cool to touch when in use, and the durable heavy glass lid is a great addition if wanting to sweat any foods like a garlic, onion, and mushroom sauté in butter to top your steak or scramble! It's an economical size for little garnishes like that too.  The base is nice and solid and doesn't feel like it will warp over time like other cheaper pans. If you are going to clean your pan or soak right after use, don't use cold water as the fast heat change from hot to cold could cause warping. Warm or hot water is best.  Big love for the pans from this MSMK non-stick collection! This one is my third. They perform wonderfully, are high quality and are a good investment."
"No harmful substances in the non stick coating! This is a huge selling point for me, I’ve done my homework and wouldn’t have ordered otherwise. My eggs come out amazing, they slide right onto the plate, clean up is simple, dishwasher safe, although a quick soapy rinse and dry is all that’s needed. Very impressed with this little fry pan. Highly recommend."
This frying pan with lid arrives well protected in a retail box that is easy to open and start enjoying right away. The pan heats very evenly and the lid fits well and is easy to see through. It is very clean. I feel this is a good value at the current price where you are getting more value for your money.
"Is this pan made from magic or what is going on?! I normally have a TERRIBLE time with basically all pans. Everything I make sticks to every pan I try! Not this one though!! I’ve tried all my normally difficult foods… eggs, rice, steak, potatoes… all came out amazing with no sticking!  This pan is very durable but not so heavy that it’s hard to lift, the handle has stayed cool each time I’ve used it, and it’s super easy to clean because the food just comes right off! I have been careful to not cook past medium heat (although maybe it would be fine and I am just paranoid), and I always let it cool before washing. It says the pan is dishwasher safe, but I’m not chancing it and have been hand washing this pan.  Pretty amazing that it’s oven safe to 700 degrees! Wow! I’m really glad I found this pan because cooking had been a super frustrating experience with everything sticking all of the time, and now it’s much more enjoyable experience!"
"This pan is great for making omelets. It is the perfect size for three eggs and the fixings of a balanced breakfast. Of course, it works great for sauteing any number of things you might want in your meal. I love the nature of this nonstick pan, and the weight of it lets you know you have quality."
"A wonderful deep frying pan. MSMK has this high-quality deep non-stick pan for just about anything you want to cook. Eggs, rice, corn, tacos, sauces, chicken, and on and on. This is such an awesome pan that is large enough to hold quite a bit of food and deep enough to handle some light deep frying. The pan is solid feeling and seems to be well constructed, but I am no engineer. It is non-stick, but not a ceramic pan. One really great feature is the induction bottom. If you have an induction stove, you can use this on there as well. For basic care, I would hand wash this, as most food comes right off, and it's so simple to clean. Also, if you have the option, hang it on a hook as it will chip easily if you mix it in with other pans, as mine got a nick on the edge already. I won't knock it any stars for that as I tend to stack my pots and pans (no room for everything). For the price, you are getting a great skillet, deep frying pan."
"I really like these MSMK pots and pans. They are heavy, conduct heat well, and are of good quality. It has been difficult finding pots and pans that go in the oven on high heat without melting the handles and these are good up to 700 degrees. The pans have nice long, strong handles. The lids fit well and have a steam vent hole in them to prevent the hot steam and water from oozing out from under the edges of the lid. The only thing I don’t like about them is the handles of the lids tend to get warm after sitting on the hot burner for a while. I have to remember not to burn myself when taking the lid off, so I reduced my review by one star for that. Otherwise, they are perfect and I love them!"
"I was in need of a 11-12 inch scratch-resistant skillet, so I decided to give the MSMK Nonstick Frying Pan with lid a try.  Typically, when I get a skillet, there is no cover, so the fact that this frying pan does come with a lid is a pus!  I'm not too familiar with the brand, but I do like the fact that it's a heavy duty frying pan with 4mm stainless steel bottom. Had no problems heating this pan up and cooking on it.  At under $90, the skillet is something I do like. If it fails to go on more than a year or so, I will definitely update this review. But for now, so far so good and used it quite a bit during the holidays!"
"Pros - they look really nice and clean easy. They're definitely non stick. And they cook evenly. Cons - While cooking eggs, the handle started to warm, so I think it would get hot after a certain amount of time. The pans are quite heavy, so they're not good for someone in search of something light weight. And the instructions on how to handle and care for them are fairly particular; including to not use them on high heat. So maybe not the best for people who like to do things quick and easy, but likely really good for people who don't mind taking their time and being methodical."
"Great to work with, everything cookes beautfly, and the best part is a wonderful quality and not heavy at all. This is a must on your home or restaurant kitchen."
This omelette pan is awesome. It cooks food evenly. It is super easy to clean. I love that the lid has a hole to get rid of excess steam. I’m a huge fan!
"This is an excellent pan - looks good and is very easy to clean - even with some burning. It's reasonably heavy, but to so much that it is difficult to use around the kitchen. The price point is higher than some of the other choices - but it also comes with a lid - which many of these pans do not have. On balance, it is an expensive pan for an ""off-brand"" product. However, it works well, is high quality, and the non-stick is excellent."
"Perfect size. Made French toast and eggs, cooked evenly and cleaned easily. Definitely recommend."
Very pleased with pot. Easy to clean and nothing stuck to it
This is an excellent frying pan. It heats up and cooks evenly. It doesn't stick on the pan even if you use a little bit of oil. The best part is you can even put it in the oven if you need to finish cooking your food. it's super easy to clean and it's scratch resistant. This is a great gift for any family that loves cooking or simply wants to eat more healthily.
"We're very happy with this pan. The heat distribution seems pretty good. Both the inside and the outside are relatively easy to clean. The coating seems to be sturdy enough for regular use, although we are certainly avoiding metal implements or harsh scrubbing. Mostly things can just be sponged off, though, especially if you soak it a little first."
Tried my new Frying Pan out and I am very happy with the performance. The Omelette turned out great and the Pan was easy to clean. I like the fact that it comes with a lid and the sides are the perfect hight and it feels sturdy in my hand.
Nice pan. Lightweight. Non stick does a good job. Be aware that these are dishwasher safe but it is not recommended in an effort to preserve the coating. Our high end pan that cost three times as much has the same recommendation.
"My perfect pan. Heavy-bottomed for even weight distribution and heating, but not hard to lift and manage. Nonstick works great, and clean-up is easy. It's the pan I'm always looking for, but never finding. I found it!"
"Great to work with, everything cookes beautfly, and the best part is a wonderful quality and not heavy at all. This is a must on your home or restaurant kitchen."
"with a robust lid as well, this is commerical quality non stick is superb, nothing sticks an the handle is excellent, u can get a grip on it... the size is just right for me... hard to find much wrong with this pan, very happy!"
Has been easy to clean and cook with. No problems cooking in this pan so far.
"The packaging was very upscale and secure. The pan is solid and performs perfectly on my induction top. I've only used it twice, but so far so good. I'll put an update in six months or a year if there's any change."
"Exactly what I hoped for, timely delivery and quality product We use this pan and cover on a daily basis for our breakfast, holding up better than the one we replaced. Easy to clean."
Nice little egg pan. Doesn’t tolerate high heat. Like for burgers. But it serves my purpose! IT IS rather expensive though.
Make sure you read the care instructions or you will ruin your pan !!!!
"OK, if you are reading this your are wondering how anything this expensive could really be worth it. So here is my initial take on my first experience with owning Hestan. I love cooking, do a lot, and I've probably had 20 or more brands of cookware over the last 25 years, some cheaper, some expensive. When it comes to non-stick cookware we found it actually best to buy cheaper / name brands such as Farberware or Good Cook - and after 2 years when the surface starts to come apart, buy a new one. All non-stick surfaces fail, period. I've bee looking to upgrade my stainless to a new multi-ply and after reading about Hestan Nanobond Titanium I decided to try. Right out of the box you think ""Wow - that's one beautiful pan! I'm not sure I want to even use it!"" It has a unique silver beauty that changes with the light from very light to shades of dark. The inside surface is really, really slick, much like the non-stick; certainly naturally slicker than regular high grade stainless. So I put this all purpose pan to the full bore torture test of searing at high temps, sauces, some confectionary stuff, various sautees, stir fry, broiling, etc, etc. I was totally impressed with how this pan cooks: heats quickly, cooks evenly, much easier to control on my gas range, cleans really really easily. I did burn some leftovers in the pan on purpose. And it still cleaned easily on any comparative basis. I used metal cooking utensils most of the time. It is not non-stick but with a touch of oil, gets fairly close; certainly slicker than regular stainless. After repeated use and abuse the inside had some minor discoloration, as well as the outside bottom. Not horrible, but noticeable. So I then used the special cleaner sample that came with the pan and with almost no effort the pan returned to it's original luster - perfect. If I returned the pan probably no one would know I cooked with it every day for 10 days. Not a spot or a mark. Perfect. Wow. I've also recently tried a couple other high end brand stainless and while impressed..... I'd go for the Hestan given any choice if cost was not an issue. Hestan is about 30% more expensive vs. what I'm already looking at. Long term durability??? Well, guess we'll have to see, as I'm keeping this one... returning the others. Will I be buying the full 10 piece set (Hestan has it on special for $1,599 right now vs ~$2k); dammit... probably!"
"I've been looking for a larger all in one for awhile and I wanted to upgrade, thought this was it. As I cook ALL the time. I decided that since I wanted to get the best I could find I looked at this one, given the price I expected this to be perfect. I'm disappointed.  The looks:  Honestly the pan looks amazing. The polish and finish are top notch.  How it handles:  Heavy. It's a bit unwieldy if I'm honest. I've really needed some time to get the balance right and often times I have to use two hands to deal with it (I'm 185 and fit) The handle is slightly too thin so it wants to move left and right when you have it half full of whatever you're cooking. Holding with one hand takes practice with this pan.  How it cooks:  Feels like any other stainless pan if I'm honest. The heat seems uniform as I would expect for a pan in this price range. The fond comes off nicely but tends to stick like crazy so it's hard to see if you're getting it right or burning.  My gripe:  For the price I'm expecting a perfect pan. This was my 2nd one. The 1st one had a stain I couldn't remove with soap and water so I returned it. I used to be able to slide an egg right off (with right heat and butter) but recently it has developed splotches that have allowed all manner of food to stick. The stains have been challenging to remove. I've used vinegar and it seems to work pretty well but these last few times I couldn't remove through normal means. I believe they want to use their proprietary cleaner to it all cleaned, that's annoying. In conclusion, great looking pan but mediocre performance given the price."
"As a real user, I don't recommend this product. I really don't know this is non stick pan. It is wasting money My cast iron pan is much better than this."
"It is pricey, but its a very nice looking pan that can be used for a lot of dishes. Easy to clean, sears meat nicely, and it is not real heavy so easy to maneuver on the stove. I have All Clad and Demeyere which I love, but this is my favorite all in one pan!"
"I know, I know - another 5-star review from a Vine reviewer. In this case, it's well-earned, and I don't give 5 stars very often (check my reviews). This pan is among the best I've ever tried in the 20+ years I've been testing kitchenware. I've actually already purchased more pieces in this line for when I need more than one pan to cook dinner.  1. Great size for one or two people. I cook 5-7 days/week for myself and my husband, and this pan really does replace pretty much everything for us. Previously, I used a 2-quart saucepan, 3.5-quart saute pan (straight sides), and/or a 12-inch skillet for pretty much every meal - this one does all those jobs in spades. Stir-fry, soup, spaghetti sauce, vegetables, eggs -- it all works. I've bought the 8.5 inch skillet and 2 quart saute pan to supplement, but I can get away with only using this pan when I cook from one-pan cookbooks. 2. What people say about clean-up is true. I've never found stainless steel especially difficult to clean unless I did something truly disastrous, so I figured this would be about the same. No. Not even remotely. I can practically use my fingers to clean off anything on this pan, once it's cooled in the sink. Anything really stuck on can be attacked with steel wool, according to the instructions, but I've yet to have the need. 3. Comfortable to use. The handle is at a good angle for me, and doesn't seem to heat up as quickly as other pans. The shape of this pan makes it easier to carry and pour than the 3.5 quart saute pan, too. 4. Good heat distribution. I haven't noticed any hot spots using my gas range. The instructions recommend heating your oil on medium to medium-high, and paying close attention, since this pan heats faster than stainless. I've found this to be true, which has meant I have to adjust my mis en place a bit - I usually leave some of it for when the pan is heating, but I can't with this baby. 5. Lid fits securely - but of course it gets hots. No problems with steam escaping that I've seen, better than many pots I've used. 6. Looks great. I keep my pans in a drawer, so I really don't care how they look, but for those who like beautiful cookware, this is it. Definitely dry immediately after you wash, though, because it'll get water spots if you leave it to air dry. These wipe up easily, too, though. The company included a sample of their cleaner to refresh your pan if it lose its pretty finish, but I've yet to need it. Note that they say you can also just use a cut half of a lemon if you notice any blue-ing of the finish from cooking. Kinda handy to know!  Overall, I'm genuinely thrilled with this pan, and kind of amazed how much better I like it than my All-Clad, Calphalon, and Breville cookware. Definitely recommended."
"Besides being beautiful, the Hestan NanoBond Titanium All-In-One Pan has a good heft to it which usually indicates quality. My gourmet chef Wife calls it a joy to use. The handle stays cool although you would not want to put your hand too far up the handle because there is a point where the heat begins. It does seem to cook evenly. It usually cleans up well but it looks best when using a fine grade scouring powder that is designed for pots and pans. The lid is a perfect fit. The handle on top of the lid gets a bit warm so you might want to use a pot holder to lift it. They are easy to pour out the contents when transferring those contents to another pan or dish."
"I have learned to cook with stainless steel and I love my Viking set of stainless. We've tried lots of different cookware in our quest for the perfect pan for my husband's various Gordon Ramsey recipes. You know, the kind that rely heavily on the quality of a pan for success.  Very little learning curve as long as you understand this metal conducts faster than stainless or cast iron. This pan is lightweight but insanely effective, and I love using it. Heats up faster than stainless and the heat distribution is even and consistent.  It's gorgeous, for those of you who like to hang your pans up on display. Clean-up is easier than stainless and I just can't believe how good it looks after a couple months of heavy, consistent use."
"This is my second piece of Hestan cookware, and it's just as good as the first. This is not your typical heavy cookware like copper. This is more lightweight and it has an amazing finish that resists sticking, and it's dishwasher safe. Having used this for many weeks, sometimes more than once a day I can say that the Hestan NanoBond cookware is some of the best I have ever owned."
this pan is something to behold. Wow. It is just gorgeous. It also cooks and cleans really well. I have absolutely no complaints about it and love it.
I love this pan! With just about a tablespoon of oil I cooked my meat. I soaked my meat with a lot of minced garlic and soy sauce and brown sugar and nothing stuck to the pan. Clean up was easy. I did notice a film after washing the pan so I put a little lemon juice in and washed the pan. It's back to its original clean and shine! The price is a bit steep but I intend to use this several times a week so the time I save cleaning the pan makes up for the price.
"As someone who has bought, used and discarded their fair share of pans throughout the past 5 yrs, I can honestly say these are the best pans I've owned EVER! I was looking for andonized pans over a year ago - told my husband what I wanted but he stayed with family who owned ceramic pans so that's what I got for Christmas last year. I detested those things! Everything stuck to them, they were impossible to clean and within a few months, there were marks on them that I couldn't clean. The year before, I had fallen for the commercials on those copper pans. Out of all I bought, I loved the deep, square one and that was it! I sooo hated the small one that my husband made eggs in - both of these 2 I mention? Eggs would stick to them so bad, I would have to soak them for hours. And the rivets? OHHH the rivets! I had food in those rivets like crazy. My mom did listen to me and for Christmas bought me a set of Andonized pans, just from another company. They were great BUT they didn't have coated rivets. So when I had enough of all this, I stumbled across these and gave them a shot. Oh how I wish these had been bought years ago. They are a cinch to clean - no matter what it is. From eggs to steak to burned food lol Doesn't matter - I have not have 1 single thing that I could not simply wipe off and clean with no problem! The rivets? I'm in LOVE with these rivets! They're coated so there is no food sticking to them!!! Things cook evenly - I've had no problems with uneven cooking. So I hand wash them. Big deal. I'd do this for the rest of my days to keep these pans, believe me! Buy these, you won't regret it!"
"I have had many nonstick pans over the many years and have never liked them. I have always been a stainless steel girl but I am now a convert!  I was kind of forced into buying a nonstick pan and that's how this all started. I bought some frozen Tai Pei potstickers (they're really good for a frozen product!) and tried cooking them for the first time in one of my regular pans but sadly, while they tasted good, they lived up to their name and stuck to the pan. Liking them as I did, I decided to buy a nonstick pan and purchased one of these T-Fal hard anodized pans and absolutely loved it! That led me to buying this two-pan set so now I have 3 of them. Now I want saucepans too. Too bad I didn't just buy the whole cook set but I never dreamed I would like these so much.  I've had nonstick pans in the past where things still stuck to them and they just weren't as hearty and well built as these pans. I've cooked several different things in them now with great success that would have been a problem in my other pans, including the potstickers which no longer stick. The clean up is a snap and they nest well with themselves and my other stainless pans. The handles are also very comfortable and easy to use. I have complete control when picking up even a heavily filled pan. I've had high end pans with handles that were absolutely horrible in terms of control. There's no need for an oven mitt or anything, they remain cool.  Whether you love nonstick pans or are like I was, a real hater of them, give these a try! They are fabulous!"
"Scammed by copper pan commercials, we wasted our money. We have also tried several other pans over the years that just always sucked.  We are vegan so we eat a lot of tofu, which has ALWAYS stuck in our previous pans. Not these! Even pancakes just slide right off. So much stress has been avoided in my kitchen since this purchase. :P"
"I waited a year to review these pans because a lot of time, pans ""revolutionary"" coatings easily chip and performance fades as they are used. The Good: After a year, the non-stick coatings are over 99% like new except where obvious abuse by silverware or other metal contact has scratched. That said, it takes a lot to damage the coating. Non-stick - NOTHING is 100% non-stick. That said, with correct temp and a little lubrication from your favorite oil, you can consistently cook eggs without a spatula. I can heat up sticky leftovers and remove the majority of the residue with a simple light soapy brushing in the sink. The Bad: The heat identifier isn't that visible. Oveall - these pans have met and exceeded my expectations and we use them daily because of their ease to use and clean. They are thick so they will not warp with constant use. It takes a lot to get them hot enough to burn your food. I have a12 yo child at home who is experimenting with cooking. She has not destroyed them yet."

"I have a nice set of cookware of all sorts. I wanted some nonstick skillets for things like eggs, sticky sauces etc. I had seen T-fal at places like Walmart. Weii.......these are not those type pans at all. These hard anodized skillets are a different thing entirely. They are a pro-grade item without the high price. They are flat, they are sturdy, they look nice. Cleaning is a breeze. I have used them now for months, they are still as good as the day I bought them. I do take care of them correctly, in return they do the job for me every time."
"Bought these because I was concerned about the surfaces degrading on our older non-stick pans. I had no idea how well these would cook! Love the even heat distribution and the indicator when the cookware is fully heated! This cookware just fries things so well! They make me look like a better cook than I am! Frankly, we are enjoying dishes I didn't bother to cook regularly before because they always seemed to stick. Will see how well these wear over time, and I do plan to put them in the dishwasher which might affect their longevity, but at present I'm truly excited to cook with these. The small skillet is perfect for a number of tasks, such as eggs, as the sides are fairly deep."
"The same 10"" pan I bought in the past was by far my favorite non stick hands down! Has a great side edge that makes flipping food super easy. Surface has held up really well even though I have to use a small amount of oil after awhile. However, even though these pans have that edge, the bottoms are not even remotely flat. The 8"" is high in the middle and the 10"" is warped the the side (tested with water before putting on stove) . My previous 10"" is totally flat. Only difference is the rivets were not coated by non stick material on older one. Also, just to test the non stick, I washed the 8"" and fried an egg with no oil for the first cook. Usually I can get at least a few months of complete non stickability. This time both eggs bonded to the bottom and had to cleaned off. Not good for the trial run... I think they are going back and maybe I can find something else with that edge I like. I tried the Pro series in a 12"" but had the same problem with the center being higher than the sides making liquids flow to the outer rim. If I have to use oil, may try to find something ceramic or stainless. I have a green pan that works great with a minute amount of oil but the sides are much lower so harder to do the quick flipping motion that works so well with fast cooking."
"These are the pans you want. Stop shopping and buy them. Flawless. Perfect size for my Kenmore stove, they cover the burners precisely, no extraneous heat escaping. Perfect, frankly. I use them ALL the time. Just set that stove to medium and don't worry about a thing. Easy to use, easy to clean. Steep sides also makes stirring a bit easier, you'd have to TRY to spill the food you're cooking. They feel and look sturdy as iron. The heat does seem to distribute nicely across the pan surface. What else is there to say? Can't be beat, IMO. (If you've had lower grade T-Fal stuff in the past, don't judge these based on those.)"
"I bought these same pans a year and a half ago for my kitchen and I use them almost every day. I bought these for a friend, and I hope he finds them a great addition to his kitchen, as well. They are so easy to clean and the heat distribution makes cooking a lot better! I find the smaller skillet very helpful in cooking for one. I wish they came with lids"
"Before cooking with the pans, we seasoned them with Canola Oil. Yes, you CAN season titanium pans and many websites recommend doing so. After that, we added 6 fresh egg and began stirring with a plastic spatula. A very minimal amount of the eggs stuck to the sides of the pan where it was somewhat difficult to scrape with the spatula. Once cooked, almost all of the eggs easily slid out of the pan onto our plates. The small amount of eggs remaining in the pan were able to be totally removed with very light scrubbing using a non-scratch cleaning sponge with plastic mesh. Pan looks as good as new and ready to cook our next meal."
"I just got a new electric smooth top range so I wanted some new, unwarped skillets to use on it. America's Test Kitchen tested a similar T-fal pan and said it was great so I bought these. They weren't the exact same pan that ATK reviewed but were a little heavier and cheaper, too.  Anyway, I LOVE them! I am careful with my nonstick pans. I hand wash them, avoid overheating them, and don't use metal utensils on them. This pan has been great. T-fal says it's okay to use metal utensils on them but I don't. My pan has been used almost daily since I bought it and it still releases eggs just fine and it is so easy to clean up. It's heavy, no doubt, but heats up extremely evenly for fantastic cooking.  I use the larger pan much more often than the smaller pan. If you just want to buy one I would recommend you get the larger one.  I liked them so much I bought a set for my son, too, and he loves them just as much as I do."
I debated between several different pans for a while and finally settled on these due to all the positive reviews. I'm so glad I did. These pans clean so easily and seem to heat much better than other pans that I've had. I only wash by hand and I do not use metal utensils but I treat all of my cookware this way so I can't say if they scratch easily but i would definitely buy these again. Well worth every penny and they are actually much less expensive than a lot of the pans that I checked.
"Bought these based on reviews and glad we did. They are somewhat lightweight but they work great, and are well made. The teflon ( which if I'm right ,is actually hard anodize on aluminum) is very much non stick. Food cooks good and the pans clean up easy. One review I read made a lot of sense. You can pay a lot for a pan, but the thickness of the coating is all pretty much the same, .002 of an inch. It can be less on a real cheap pan, but it can not be more. You will get the same lifetime out of the coating from an relatively inexpensive pan as you will from a real expensive pan. So if you can find something decently well made you might be saving a few bucks and get the same lifetime out of the product. These might not be the absolute best on the market, but we love them and are happy every time we use them. What more do you want from a pan."
"I had Calphalon which were much heavier with better heat distribution, and way more expensive. They started having issues with nonstick layer after about two years of use. Decided to try these ones and was pleasantly surprised. T-fal is good if you don't go with cheapest option they have."
"This is Amazing! Non-Stick that actually is non-stick.  The directions say to use a small amount of oil, and they mean like a teaspoon. Best used over medium heat. The pan has a red circle in the center when the spokes disappear, the pan is hot. Crack a couple of eggs in it and in a minute or so, give the pan a shake and they slide all over the pan. With a snap of the wrist and you can flip them over, then they slide out of the pan. Clean up with a paper towel and wash when cool.  I deliberately burned a slice of cheese in the pan, and it slipped out with a little push with a plastic spatula."
"For 50 years I searched for good quick-release cooking surface, reasonably scratch resistant, cool handles, even heat distribution at a reasonable price. After one year of regular use...this is still IT, as good as new. No more dating other cookware for me...those relationships always end rough too soon. The bonus is that this line is also beautiful and easy to keep clean, and my wife is not jealous."
"I used these pans at a friends house and had to have them. Got them, used them, and they are the best. Fried great and cleaned up great. I read a few of the one star ratings. LOL is all I can say about that .I wonder who these people are. I use different types of fry pans. Non stick teflon type, Stainless steel, and cast iron. They all have their place in the kitchen. When you need non stick fry pans, these worked great. I am very satisfies with my purchase. From my experience so far, they are non stick and slick as silk."
"I'm on my third set of these pans. The pans are great but they only last about a year or so if you use them daily. We try not to over heat them, but eventually the coating will wear out. I don't know of any other nonstick pan that lasts forever, so I assume all other coatings wear out too. I highly recommend them."
"I am happy with the purchase.. Do not use a cooking spray, not good for the coating. I use a drop or two or oil or butter depending on what I am cooking. Not really needed but I like to do it. Very easy to clean. They cook well using medium heat."
"This is the best set of inexpensive frying pans I've found. I like the riveted handles with silicone covers, and the hard-anodized finish is more durable than enameled or powder coated finishes. If you use a tiny dot of coconut oil or similar, nothing will stick to the T-Fal Titanium nonstick coating. You can just wipe the pan clean with a paper towel after it cools – no need to wash it. The T-Fal red center dot is handy for seeing when the pan is at the correct temperature for cooking. This is very well-made cookware at a bargain price."
"second set, first set coating finally wearing out. will buy again."
"Love these low-maintenance pans! We already had the 12"" and we liked it so much we just got the 10"" and 8"". They seem durable, the non-stick surface is great, and the best thing is you can throw them in the dishwasher. Because who likes hand washing pots and pans, amirite!? (Yes, I'm a guy.)"
These pans are great and should last as long as the old set. We bought the entire set 2 yrs. ago and couldn't be happier. The 8 and 10 inch are used almost daily and are in ruff shape. Thankfully these come separate so we didn't fork over another 200 bucks since these are most used pans in the bunch.
So far I have obly used them two times. Both time I have had NO sticking issues. I brought some nice looking aluminum cookware and those pans stick ALL DAY LONG
Got 8 and 10 inch fry pans to replace Calphalon which lasted a long time but have been losing their coating. New Calphalon are 2X more expensive than these T-Fal. They feel (weight & balance) and fry just fine and I have had great prior experience with t-Fal pots. So far - so good
"These are perfectly shaped, easy to handle and clean, and they cook perfectly. They say you can run them through the diswasher, but past experience with tFal suggests otherwise."
I use these pans every day. They work amazing and they hardly stick! Just a little oil or butter is needed.
"I had a T-fal pan a while ago and really like it, so when I saw those pans, decided to purchase them.....glad I did! I got rid of all other flying pans, all I need are those T-fal pans ;) Tjey don't stick and easy to clean. The small one is perfect for making an individual omlet!"
"I love my pans. They have the perfect size and depth. They are super easy to clean. I normally clean them with my hands and soap so I don't mess with the coating and it's super easy. I love that even the screws are coated because I bought a different brand and the screws were not coated, so the food sticks there."
"I have been cooking with a stainless steel pan for a year or so and everything stuck to it like glue without fail. Last night I got this pan and cooked some salmon. Normally when I cook salmon the skin sticks to the pan, ruining one of my favorite parts of the dish. Last night, I had no trouble whatsoever flipping my salmon and nothing stuck to the pan at all. It was like a dream!"
"These are tough, absolutely non-stock and the easiest pans in my kitchen to clean. I had a thermospot pan years ago and gave it away before the Teflon ever scratched off. I don't use these for much but a grilled cheese has never been crustier or easier to clean up and my delicate nuts get toasted without burning or sticking. I would prefer a heavier pan (just a preference) but my Mom who has Carpal Tunnel loves their lightweight. This particular anodized pan is a bit heavier than some of their others. If you cook for a big family, I would suggest buying the 13.5"" skillet with helper handle in addition to this set."
"I was disgusted with he price and short life span of the newest ceramic, non stick pans. I got about 6-10 months out of them. Even though I re-applied the oil and baked them per instructions after a couple months, they still had to be tossed out. So, I tried the T Fal brand and I am completely satisfied with it. Just FYI, discard pan if the finish starts coming off. I have had one T Fal non stick skillet that I've have for about 4 years or more and it's still fine but I don't put it in the dishwasher; wash it in hot soapy water instead. This will extend the life of the pans."
"These pans are well made, heavy, but not too heavy. The handles are cool and have a nice grip. Distributes heat evenly We are careful with ours, having purchased five of various sizes. Always allow to cool before cleaning them. And do not heat over medium heat. If you need high heat, grab your cast iron."
What I liked most about these frying pans was the heat distribution when you fry an egg or fry potatoes..you can actually see the heat cooking your food evenly all around the pan..I love that they are so easy to clean too!
"I love T-Fal but be careful that you aren't buying a ""cheaper"" T-Fal. I bought this set from Walmart and it was NOT of the same quality. I use these 2 pans every day and they never seem to wear. Love my purchase."
"I bought these pans two years ago. I use them every day and they still look and work like the day I bought them. If you know how to take care of pans properly, they will last a very long time. If I ever need pans again, I will certainly buy these again... no question!"
"These are the very best non-stick pans I have ever used. I rubbed them good with oil all over as soon as I got them and put on top of the stove eye for 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then rubbed them down with paper towels until they were smooth. I immediately scrambled six eggs, which turned out nice and fluffy and we had egg sandwiches with mayo. Ummmhmmmm delish. Not even a speck of egg stuck to the pan. You'll love these if you try them. They are deep on the sides also. Love love them."
"Easy to use, fast clean up."
I love the t fal skillets. They heat evenly and you don't need t have high heat. Cleans up really easy.
I love the way these pans cook. My food comes out delicious and evenly cooked and clean up is so easy. I cook with lower temperatures and get great results. My new favorites.
"Looks good, is easy to use and clean. A bit heavy (this is a good feature). Kind of expensive."
"I don't think, unless you are a moron, that you couldn't cook with ease and clean with ease. An ideal product that is even attractive on your stovetop :)"
"I LOVE these T-Fal TITANIUM pans. Look at my photos, see that bottom? These will not warp or buckle when they get hot & are being used. Wonderful non-stick, sturdy handle. These are far superior to any other T-Fal pans. It's in the construction, that bottom...I love that they are anodized. I got myself a set of the 8"" & 10"" and just sent a set to my mom. She was disgusted by the 2 cheap pans my sister had sent her for Christmas less than a year ago. She was thrilled to get these - she had used them when she was up visiting me over the summer & saw the great quality."
Always trusted TFal but on this model I found it to be even better than before; excellent quality and very good pan for any use; easy to clean for sure.
After two years of very heavy use it still looks good and is only now starting to stick to delicate things like over easy eggs. From now on I am only ordering T-fal pans.
"This pan is amazing! Nothing sticks at all! We don't even have to put oil or anything in the pan. I have never made scrambled eggs or pancakes without putting butter or oil in the pan before. But there is no need with this pan. And so therefore, cleaning is a breeze. It seems it will never wear out!"
They cook perfect!! So easy to clean Wish I had bought these years ago!!!
"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Super strong, very easy to cook with, and cleans without effort. The best pans I have ever owned."
"Why pay $100 or more for a frying pan. These work great and are super easy to clean. Eggs, steak, pork chops fish all cook fine."
"These pans aren't to heavy for me, and perform beautifully. Clean up is very easy. I have a cabinet full of pro cookware that is simply becoming to heavy for me to enjoy. These are my go-to pans now!"
"A year ago I bought the larger pan with the added handle. It was so good, with the pre-heat indicators, that I got the smaller versions. These are great and durable ."
"These sturdy pans are wonderful! The non-stick coating of my old pans was starting to peel and they needed to be replaced. So happy to have these titanium pans - they heat evenly, keep food from sticking,clean up easily and overall are a big improvement."
"Great pans, good value. I have some much more expensive stainless clad pans. these are much better."
I follow the directions on how to treat the pans before you use them and they work great there my go to pans for cooking great quality and prices.
"I originally purchased the same saute pan in a 5 quart size at Costco. I was very impressed with how easy it was to clean, and how evenly it cooked. Costco does not carry the smaller sizes, so naturally I turned to Amazon. I have owned this set of saute pans for 3 months, and at least one, if not both, are used daily. They still look brand new. It's important to note that the instructions say that you shouldn't use them on high heat for long periods of time, or plunge them into cold water while they are hot, as this will cause them to warp. The manufacturer also recommends that these not go in the dishwasher. That's not difficult, since clean up is a breeze."
Have bought several very expensive pans that say stick free and after one use they look 5 years old from stuff sticking these pans are by far the easiest to clean one rinse and they would be good to cook something else my wife tells me every time how awesome they are
I am so glad I bought these pans! I have been using these for a couple of month now and I haven’t had any issues. Food cooks quicker than most pans I have used in the past and it’s so easy to clean because I don’t need to use a lot of strength to scrub the pans. Highly recommend!
"Love these pans. Sturdy but not heavy, very easy to use and clean."
My favorite skillets! Use lower heat than you normally use. Don't use oven cleaner to remove stains on bottom! I ruined a set and had to reorder these. Lesson learned.
"I previously used stainless steel pans, and now that I use these they are a breeze to clean. I'm so happy with this purchase, and I have had no problems with them. Would recommend."
This is the second set I have purchased. I used the first pan for over a year and the only problem I ran into was a slight bowing of the bottom which made a seal to the glass cooktop less than efficient. The non stick surface is so good I purchased another for my sister! 'Nuf said?
Nothing sticks washes easily unlike other non atick i have used
I like the pans. The smaller one is my go-to egg pan. Both heat up quickly and the food cooks fine. That's all I can ask for.
"great pans, love to cook more than ever now. cleaning so so so easy."
"Let's be honest, these are non-stick pans, nothing really sticks to it, so wash it gently, don't scrub it too hard --- you don't need to scrub anyway. No extreme heat to fry things, no super hot directly thrown into ice water...just generally treat it well, it can last a looooooog time."
"Love these pans! They make cooking a pleasure! So nice to cook in, so easy to clean!"
"I have bought nearly every pot and pan T-Fal has, they are amazing. SO easy to clean, just rinse water and the mess is gone! How is that even possible? I've had mine for several years and they act brand new. I recommend getting the ones with the circles in the middle not the ones with the roughness inside."
"These are a game changer. Non-stick, absolutely. Really inexpensive. I tend to ding them up. But it’s ok. Get a new set every couple years."
"These are amazing. Non stick is an understatement. They are gliders, all food will come off no matter what. I tried straight egg whites and they wouldnt stick. They are super easy to use, make food easier to cook and taste, and get a semi wet paper towel and they are clean in 30 seconds."
"Have had lots of non-stick pans, and they all either stick or scratch right away, this one is different. First it is not cheap light weight. It is solid and has a good feel and the balance is great so it does not want to tip over like many we have tried. It has a textured bottom but works perfectly on our induction cook top. Because of its thickness it takes a little longer to heat up than cheaper pans, but it also cooks more evenly and has a larger surface area before the slope of the sides starts."
"Best cookware I've EVER used. Easy to cook in, easy to clean up, nothing sticks from cheeses to potatoes cooked w/o oil to every other thing I've cooked so far. WHERE has this Sensarte Cookware been all my life!  Highly recommend these, got all 4 pcs Amazon has which is all I need to cook anything I want to cook. The lid from 4.5 qt stockpot fits on this 9.5"" fry pan."
"I'm very happy with the pan. Good quality, solid, excellent non-stick cooking surface. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that this is the second Sensarte that I've purchase with a loose handle. In both cases the mounting screw was too long. I had to cut about 2-3 mm off the screw in order to tighten the handle securely. In addition, there were a lot of loose aluminum shavings under the handle, which should have been cleaned prior to assembly. Hopefully the company will read this and improve the assembly quality control. But this is a minor complaint. I'd definitely recommend this pan."
"I am now on my 3rd Sensarte product. I've had expensive name brands, infomercial brands, but NOTHING has performed to the level this brand has. At first I thought maybe it was just the 1st product I bought from them, but then I bought the griddle, and it too worked like nothing else I've cooked with. So now I bought this frying pan and it too is just as reliable, just as easy, I just can't even believe there is cookware this great for such a reasonable price! I love these so much I am buying them as gifts!  My only complaint is with the lid on the really big/deep pan, it dropped (on the floor) and shattered, whereas none of my other pans have had that happen. But I have a lid from a previous pan that fits just fine. Sensarte, either use a different material, build it better, or offer replacement lids please!"
"I cook eggs with this every morning. After buying it 6 months ago, I decided to write a review and let others know how satisfied I am with it. With the right heat eggs leave zero residue. I barely have to clean it after cooking. I use it on an induction stove and have scrambled eggs in about 75 seconds after cracking the egg and 90 seconds after turning on the stove. Does exactly what I’d hoped it would do."
"I love this skillet! Just a little dollop of oil before you start cooking leaves it non-stick. It is just the right size between my 10” and 12” skillets. The weight is good, heavier than aluminum and lighter than cast iron. Great buy from Amazon !!"
Received today my frying pan and made some breakfast with it!!! It is non stick and looks very durable!!! Also their customer service is amazing!! Definitely recommend!!!
"I liked the fact that this pan has an even ,non stick heat. Easy to clean after cooking. I cook pancakes ,toasted sandwiches omelets And all come out evenly cooked and easy to flip without breaking up. I would highly recommend this pan"
"Finally, a pan claiming to be stick proof is actually stick proof. Eggs slide out of pan with only a couple drops of oil to season the bottom. Very happy."
"So far the pan has been great. Heats evenly, cleans easily. Looks great, especially the wooden handle. Not for putting in the oven or dishwasher. Cleans easily by hand which others recommend and I am following that advice. Hopefully, this pan will last a few years."
"I have nothing bad to say about this pan. It’s perfect for eggs in the morning, nothing sticks and it’s super easy to clean! Cant beat the price either"
"This is the best frying pan I have ever had. It is sturdy like cast iron but non-stick as a bonus. I can sear meat, cook an egg, or saute' with no issues what so ever. I will be getting another one in the future."
"Love it so easy to clean. No matter what you cook, all you need to do is wipe with paper towel. Be sure to read instructions before you use."
I had been looking for a small skillet. It is cast iron so you have to clean it as with other cast iron. It fries evenly. I like this skillet.
Got this for making eggs and it is superb. Sister liked it so much she got one too
"I bought this to cook eggs on. It works perfectly! Also, for some reason, I noticed some other reviews saying something about using this in the oven... Really, why would you use this in the oven?.. baffling, anyways. This is a great STOVE top product. 11/10 would recommend!"
"It has a non stick coating. Great for any egg styles, I use it for most of my cooking."
No se pegan los alimentos y yo lo uso siempre
I am extremely happy with this pan. I’m going to buy the other pieces as well. I purchased one before committing to more and was looking forward a good nonstick pan that didn’t contain perfluoro alcolyl substances.
This pan is well designed and manufactured. I use it for a couple of months and it serves me very well.
"These pans are fantastic. They are easy to clean, non stick, and I really like the heft of the pan. Not flimsy like most teflon pans. Definitely going to purchase more."
I love this pan. Eggs just slide right on to the plate. Easy to wipe clean. I would definitely recommend.
"This skillet cooks things with very little oil. It wipes clean easily. Washes with warm soapy water. So far, I've had no issues. I've purchased different sizes and happy with them ALL."
I’m really happy w my purchase
Very nice and very non stick.
I’ve been using this pan for 6 months and really happy with it! Food doesn’t stick to it and cleaning it is a breeze.
Solid! Sides are higher so we can cook bacon without all the splatter. Great for omelettes. Great weight and good handle!
"I love this pan, I use it everyday. So easy to clean, nothing has stuck to it yet! Already bought more from this brand and will be slowly converting my whole collection."
As a Chef of 16yrs this is hands down on of the best quality pans I've purchased. I will buyer q bigger one also. It's just a perfect skillet for eggs 🥚!
Easy to clean No stick Perfect for eggs/omelettes.
I love it for sunny side eggs
"Good, easy to clean"
Great quality
Replacing all pans and pots with this brand. Very high quality and very durable.
"I use this daily for breakfast. Really easy to clean, heats evenly and not too heavy. Overall, nice pan"
So far is perfect. Love it.
One of the best pan I ever owned . Cleaning is a breeze and the nonstick awesome .
I can fry 4 eggs at a time. It’s a great size
This is a high quality skillet. Nice design. Easy to use and easy to clean.
"Bought as a gift for my boyfriend--it was a hit!! Fantastic product, easy to clean, he uses it every day!! I never review anything-I bought more than one from this company, and if you cook, this one is awesome!!"
"Easy to clean pan. Somewhat bulky but durable. Deep sides and thick walls. There’s no rivets at the solid wood handle so it’s super sleek. Strong and reliable, everyday use kind of pan. From sauces to cheeses, meats to fruits, nothing sticks."
"Perfect little skillet for making my morning omelet. I use two eggs plus toppings and it all fits perfectly. Very easy to clean. I don’t even wash it everyday. There’s no use since I’m going to be using it again the next morning. Just heat the skillet up a tad and wipe out with a paper towel and done! If you’re looking for a small skillet for a single meal, this skillet is for you!"
It cleans up well and has comfortable handle that is lightweight and does not get hot
excellent
Me encato puedo cocinar absolutamente todo y nada se quema ni se pega. Definitivamente la recomiendo
Actually one of my favorite pans now!
I love the sturdiness and ease of clean up.
This pan was exactly what I was looking for. I make eggs in it every morning and they don’t stick at all.
Everthing
My wife asked that I order the 14” after using it. We have tried many but none compare to this one.
"I didn't realize this was such a small pan (my mistake) so when it arrived I thought this would be a great frying pan....for Smurfs. It did come with a small dent in the metal on the handle, but it's purely cosmetic this is the only reason I'm giving it a 4. It does heat up quickly, and works fantastic for making omelets. I haven't tried cooking anything else in this pan yet. Clean up is quick and easy, and my omelet came out of the pan easily. If there are pans like this in a bigger size, I would definitely purchase them. The interior of the pan looks a lot like cast iron and the bottom of the pan is gorgeous and functional."
Love it
very good non stick pam
Great value for your money
good value
"I bought this last July. I cooked on this almost every day from egg, crepes and sautéed veggies. I love using this frying pan but I am not sure why it’s doing this. First, it was just a bubble then it came off. Sadly, I have to throw it away. I also have the Sensarte pot and it’s also doing the same thing. It starts as a bubble then the nonstick layer chipped-off. I don’t use any abrasive in cleaning this pan. I don’t use any stainless steel utensils in my non-stick either. I bought the other kind of nonstick pan that they have. I will post review after using it for a few months."
"Always disappointed that will stick sooner or later scratches in the paint closing the no stick to peel this plan is engineered quite differently it is the pleasure of cast iron with a fused aluminum bottom it's handled bolts to the outside of the pan not bolted through , on the inside second this makes for a complete smooth pan all the way around and much easier to keep clean as far as the no stick is concerned I have high hopes that it too will prove a well engineered , time will tell"
"I LOVE this pan. Great for eggs. Nice weight, and feel. Handle is great. Looks nice. The weight and material does mean it takes a bit to heat up, but it maintains temperature and cooks evenly. Truly non-stick, heavy duty, and easy to clean. We also have the larger skillet with lid that led us to purchase this one as well. This will last, and is worth every penny."
"I first purchased the 2 quart pot for my son as a Christmas gift. (Him being a bachelor, he doesn't really shop for household items.) I was impressed with the quality and heaviness of the pot while he was impressed with the easy clean up. Since he liked it so much I ended up buying the 1.5 quart, the 8 inch skillet and the 4.5 quart soup pot. They arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. This is a very handsome set for men who enjoy cooking because of the attractive wood-look handle. Love the glass lids as well."
"Loved it when I first started using the pan for my morning eggs and other food preparations that I enjoy making! I received the pan in July 2021 and it was very nice and easy to use until about a month ago. My induction cooktop started going on and off while using only this pan.I believe that's why I see the bottom of some newer pans look to be different now.Since the company specified it was induction compatible at the time of purchase, I would like a replacement with a newer version!!!"
"I was skeptical to purchase this because it was a little on the expensive side.. but after biting the bullet and spending the money I actually loved this pan and recommended it to several friends.. it was great for frying eggs and super easy to clean... but then the ""fabulous"" non stick coating started to bubble up and has now started peeling off so I can no longer use the pan for cooking anything. I am so disappointed! Keep in mind I only used silicone cookware and soap and water when cleaning since it didn't take much effort, food basically just rinsed off. So if you are ok with buying expensive things that won't last 6 months then go for it but I will not be recommending sensarte anymore. :("
I love this little skillet! I bought it specifically to make scrambled and sunny side up eggs. It does the job beautifully. With just a touch of oil eggs slide out of the pan. Clean up is a dream. Simply wipe with a paper towel or dish cloth. Be sure to use non-metal utensils and your skillet will be scratch free. Arrived looking as described. No dings or dents. 10 out of 10. Would recommend!
"This thing is fantastic. I've stopped in the middle of making breakfast to type up a review real quick. The high points are: (1) it heats evenly so you don't have to carefully arrange your food in some kind of ""safe zone"" (2) it doesn't have any little exposed bolts where the handle attaches that cause egg grime to accumulate and make you sad (3) it doesn't do that thing where you find out that there's a razor-thin coating of antistick material that just flakes off. A+, love this thing"
"This pan looks nothing like the larger 2 we ordered from you. The handle is different, the inside is solid black, not dark gray with white speckles, and even the bottom is different. I'm sure it will perform the same but if you're going to offer different sizes you should at least have them all match."
The bevel is a little steep so flipping is awkward. but all I do is make French omelets in it so it is absolutely PERFECT.
"This is great non-stick cookware. I had to use a little drop of oil for the first use, but after that, I haven't really needed to add it. This pan has cooked evenly so far and is super easy to clean. I highly recommend this product!"
"Easy to clean and definitely non-stick. We use this for crepes and they slide right out. We have the larger fry pan and skillet from Sensarte and have been careful to wash only by hand. They have shown no signs of losing the non-stick surface and work great, even for eggs! Follow the manufacturers instructions on cleaning and care. These pans are definitely worth paying a bit more for!"
I really like this pan although it’s not exactly “nonstick.” It’s very balanced weight distribution and solid state feel makes it a pleasure to cook with. A couple of drops of oil is plenty to get the nonstick performance.
I tried few nonstick before. They all started to get burn on the middle. This one i have been using for about 5 months and works great and easy to clean. Highly recommended and you wont regret.
"Cooking surface has a rough texture and is not what I expected, after cooking an egg it was impossible to flip over."
"I love this little pan. Sturdy, heats quickly, I did use a little butter, but I could tell, it was a non stick coating. Cooked my 2 egg omelet perfectly, the lid fits like a glove. And the pan is not to heavy, but not flimsey either. Well worth the price and then some. If I take good care of this pan, via the instructions for med/high heat, etc. I think this pan will last a long time. It's exactly what I was looking for! Thank you Michelangelo for creating a very nice pan!"
"The best I’ve seen and used....but you must NOT put it on any higher than MEDIUM...I really don’t know if this is ABSOLUTELY necessary, but it works so perfectly, it’s worth the few extra minutes it takes to heat. Just loved sliding my egg out like you see on TV. Since it is so easy to clean, I can only assume it’s scratch resistant. WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
"Bought this two months ago, washed by hand all the time, and overnight it just “broke”. The surface is sticky and takes forever to clean. This is not a good product. I’m returning this defecting product to seller and expecting money back"
Do not buy this product. Everything gets stuck to it and its NOT FlAT!
As a single person I have purchased several small fry pans but none came with a lid so I would have to use a larger lid to simmer or sauté foods or melt cheese . This pan clean up easily and is truly non stick. I am very happy with my purchase!
I needed a smaller pan for omelet making and heating single serve meals. This is just right for that. It's non stick coating is very efficient and the pan is of quality workmanship. I would definitely recommend and will be purchasing other pans as needed.
"This is an outstanding fry pan, nothing sticks to it. It seems to cook the food pretty fast. Love it"
"Really nice fry pan. I am very pleased with the quality and the fact that the pan includes a glass lid. Exceptional bargain! I enjoy cooking with the pan and enjoy the non-stick surface. Eggs just slide out of the pan. It is important to note that cooking instructions should be followed by using lower heat settings. Example: I have a gas stove and normally use a 4 - 6 setting for eggs. Using the Michelangelo pan, I found the setting of 2 was just perfect. Eggs were done nicely and they were not burned around the edges."
This pan is horrible! I have used this a few times and it burns and is impossible to clean!
Did not like this pan and returned it. We bought it for scrambled eggs. Had to use so much oil to avoid sticking and still ended up with sticking problems.
"I have three other non stick pans that my eggs always stick to unless I use butter.  This one actually works without oil or butter.  It says to put food in a cold pan and then turn the heat on. It also says not to wash it hot. Also, don’t use any metal spatulas etc.  Maybe I wrecked my other pans. It did say that those pans can be fixed by soaking in hot water and soap overnight. So they also gave good advice on how to fix the ones that I have. I plan on buying the larger one also.  Love it."
Holy cow!!! Made eggs for breakfast this morning and WOW!! I used a tiny bit of butter and wiped the pan clean with a paper towel. I cannot wait to use it again!
It was a great non-stick pan for about three weeks. It is no longer non-stick.
"Haven't had this very long; was looking for an option for my ""nonstick"" small saute/fry pan. So far, it is the best ""non-stick"" pan I've ever owned,. AND ... it has a lid (very much a plus). I've used it perhaps 20 times since purchase. Unlike my older, light-weight non-stick pans, it's heavy enough, and has a heat-spreading bottom, so it doesn't develop hot spots. It's very easy to clean; I just wipe it clean of any residue with a paper towel, then wash it in the dishwasher (no need for scrubbing). So far, the non-stick finish is flawless; no scratches or nicks. I AM careful; am using silicone spatulas, etc, and as I said above, I've had no need to apply any kind of force or use an abrasive/scratchy brush or pad to clean it, so I am not sure how it will stand up to heavier cleaning if the need arises. I also haven't tried cooking without a little oil or fat (e.g., scrambled eggs); suspect there might be more of a tendency to stick or burn under those circumstances. Will update if there are any problems in the future, but so far, so good -- highly recommend."
"The pan is cheeply made. The handle gets hot and dependind on what your cooking, it will burn you. The non stick surface is poor and after a few days everything sticks. If you add oil of any kind to make up for the poor non-stick, it sticks worce because the oil bonds to the non stick. ☹️"
"I don't have a dishwasher - I'm it! So, a fast, easy clean up is important to me. Even though the surface is durable I use a non-abrasive sponge. I buy a name brand sponge, the new kind with the little rivets on one side and even though plastic base, do not put too much pressure when cleaning.  Really, Michelangelo cookware doesn't need to much to clean, since food doesn't stick much. A small smidgen of egg or something might stick, might require a light scrub. With all non-stick cookware, regardless of brand I would keep the pressure light. I've owned the dark grey teflon and have scoured off the finish by applying too much pressure. I'm not about to find out how Michelangelo does under pressure!  I have bought separate Michelangelo pieces of cookware, including the wok, for electric cooking. No complaints thus far. Added note, I use coconut oil for frying and flavor."
Got this as a gift to use with an induction cooker. It worked great for both induction cooker and gas stovetop.
"I really like this pan. Easy to clean. Great for small portions, for two eggs, etc I only use it on low heat as I read it will help prolong its life. Also says not to put it under water to wash when it is still hot from cooking, so I just let it sit for a while until it cools down before I hand wash it. Sometimes all I need to do is wipe it clean with a paper towel, depending what I cooked. I'm super happy with this pan and we use it almost everyday."
"This is one of the best pans I’ve ever used. I’m not one to spend more than about $20 on a pan since I don’t cook a lot, but I was finding myself having to replace pans more frequently and my food never seemed to cook right when I finally got tired of eating fast food. This pan surprisingly makes me want to cook because I know what I’m not going to have to worry about taking the extra steps to ensure the food is cooked thoroughly. It’s also been washed in my crappy apartment dishwasher multiple times now and doesn’t have a single scratch anywhere. I’ll probably buy this in the other sizes too!"
"I love this pan. It heats evenly, nothing has stuck to it, it washes up easily, & I haven't scratched it yet. I think I'm going to buy more of these so I'll have a set."
"The pan feels very nice, super easy to clean. However, I have used it 2 times to cook eggs. I didn't have any stick issues or anything but the 2nd time I pulled it out of my dishwasher, I noticed a chip in the finish. I am not hard on my pans, I didn't use metal - only silicon spatula. Not sure how well this pan is going to hold up.  Almost a year later.... Other than the initial chip, the finish has maintained. However, the pan sticks a lot more than it used to. Surface is not quite as slick as it was when new. I only cook scrambled eggs with a tiny bit of oil in this pan. My eggs now leave a thin layer at the bottom that it stuck. It doesn't burn (yet) but makes cleaning a real ordeal. Shopping for a replacement now..."
"People whom write reviews on pots and pans on scratches etc... I have see people mistreat such items in the sink handwashing that leads to damage. Due to items rubbed on them in water and not respecting what they have with proper care. How they put them away, that leads to damage. Stacking items in them, all that rubbing and mistreatment WILL lead to issues. Proper care will keep improper matters from occurring. *People whom respect and care for their possessions, will prosper. Those whom do not, will complain. Go through the reviews and you can easily find those whom do not and those whom do of proper care/respect, to what they bought. *Responsibility, leads to prospering. Complainers, lack this."
"Great pan, easy to clean. Soak it in warm/hot water (after it cools down) for 10 minutes or so and wipe it clean. Also, the handle does not get hot! Don't believe these other reviews. The handle has been cool to the touch every single time I've used it. I also have the 1qt saucepan from them and that handle also stays cool.  Don't turn the heat up too high and burn the pan. If you DO burn the pan like I did with a salmon dish, warm water and lightly scrub with a brillo pad and the tough burn stains come right off, leaving the pan looking new again."
"Love this pan! I use a rubber spatula to avoid scratching it and so far its completely scratch less. The pan also heats up quickly and the handle feels very durable. Nothing has stuck to it yet either, but I never cook without using butter or oil to be safe. I would recommend it! With proper care it can last a long time. I also love the fact it comes with a lid."
I myself personally have not yet used the pan. My little sister was visiting with her child and needed a separate pan to cook food for her little one dude to sever food allergies. I let her borrow this pan I just purchased and she loved it. It was perfect for cooking the smaller meals for her toddler. She loved it so much she asked me to send her a link so she could buy her own! As far as I can tell there is no scratching from the constant cooking she did in it for a week and all the food seemed to come out properly
"Update: 6/13/21: The pan became unusable several weeks ago. Nonstick was completely gone. I'm still giving it 4 stars as we did get around 300 uses out of it and while it lasted, it worked pretty well. It was primarily being used to cook vegan egg and compared to an older nonstick pan we tried, the taste with this Michelangelo pan seems to be better. Ordering another one as it serves our specific need.  Original review: Been using it almost daily since buying it around 10 weeks ago. It's worked out very well. We've only been handwashing it after it cools down. Surface looks great. No chips or sign of wear."
"So far, so good. I just got this pan a few days ago and used it for the first time yesterday to make an omelette. The eggs/cheese did NOT stick to the pan. I did spray some veggie oil, but next time I'll try it without any oil to see if it's still nonstick.  I like this pan thus far. I'll use it a few more times, then probably will purchase the pots and other pans. I'll update if there are any changes to how the pan works."
"I love these pans. I bought two of these to solve a problem - my husband frying sausage or bacon every morning, with a piece of aluminum foil over top. I had to find a pan for his purpose that would prevent grease from splattering all over the stove, and these do the trick. I can find no negatives with this pan."
"I've been using this pan almost every morning since August 2020 to cook fried eggs. The nonstick coating has held up beautifully. We only use nonstick-safe spatulas and spoons with it, and hand wash immediately after use; if you use metal utensils on any nonstick pan or put it in the dishwasher you're gonna have a bad experience. I love that the pan is coated in ceramic, rather than other non-stick coatings that contain PFOAs & PTFEs."
"I like that a lid was included. However, there was very little instructions with it, such as does it need seasoning with oil or some other cooking substance? Will the top coating wear off with use and not be a non-stick finish? I will not put in dishwasher as it is easy to clean at this point. I know a dishwasher will eventually destroy the coating and it will not be non-stick at that point. I like the choice of colors. I am satisfied with the product and would order another size sometime in the future."
"Since he is the big egg eater I will go with his overwhelming approval here. It fits all the important features - omelet slides right out, clean up a breeze, believes lid really improves it. At first glance it appears small. For a big family it would be, but for his beloved 2 egg/cheese/hot pepper omelets it is perfect. He raves about it every single time he makes one (which is many times a week). So a big recommend on this product."
"This is a ceramic non stick pan. What makes it non stick it the incredible smoothness of the surface. There is nothing for food to grip so it doesn't stick. As it get old it will start to accumulate things that attach to the surface, on a cast iron pan that will be seasoning. On a ceramic pan that will be something to make it sticky. WASH the pan without scratching it. It will be a great pan that lasts a long time."
"Easy clean up, it’s good to read the info sheet that comes with it. I’m used to putting soapy water in it after cooking, not in this one. Cleans easy and fast, the food cooks evenly and fast. Very good skillet, I will buy this one again when this one gets old. The omelets I’ve cooked are so good, I want to be able to cook in this skillet everyday. Think I mentioned that the heat distribution is spot on and perfect!"
"I've been using this for months and the nonstick still functions perfectly. There's a lot of reviews of people saying it doesn't work after one use... I'd guess they aren't taking care of it right? Don't put it in the dishwasher, don't put the heat above medium, don't scratch it a ton (avoid metal spatulas and stuff). The same goes with most nonstick pans.  Also some people mentioned the bottom isn't perfectly flat and heated oil will form a ring, that's true. Doesn't really bother me, but if you don't want that I guess look for another."
"Currently, this pan lives up to the claims. It distributes heat evenly, cleans up easily. The handle does not get hot. Is working fine so far, but I've only been using it a couple months. We'll see how it holds up, long-term. UPDATE: It is now a little over 2 years since I bought this, and I just ordered a replacement set of Gotham Steel, as this item has developed pits and sticky spots. It still works, but I have to stir more often to keep the food from sticking. Overall, I feel like I got good use from it!"
"I like the nonstick copper color..and, as always with nonstick pans, I use non-metallic utinsels..so far no scratches, and the cleaning is fast..nothing sticks on it..including burned cheese. Exactly the right size for a three egg omelet, and I can flip a couple of eggs over just by a flip of the wrist..the way I used to do it with commercial egg pans. I've got this pan and a couple of saucepans..they've become my favorites in the kitchen."
"I love my new 8” pan with lid! I haven’t had it very long so have only used it for eggs and chicken breast but what a difference having a lid makes. I cooked my chicken breast with spices in vinegar. It cooked quickly and evenly with the lid on but made a huge mess in the pan. However, cleanup was supper easy with hot water, dish detergent and a sponge! Plus I can finally make an omelet without it sticking to the pan."
"I LOVE this skillet!! Bought it with small weeknight meals in mind but I end up using it to cook almost everything - toast, eggs bacon, grilled cheese, stir fry, you name it. It cleans up between foods with just the wipe of a paper towel. I put bacon in it, shower and come back and the bacon is cooked perfectly crispy and not burned. Makes my life soooo much easier."
Follow instructions that came with it. Always cook on medium or a little bit lower. Perfect for one person. I use just a slight squirt of olive oil spray first. Let cool before washing. Everything slides out of pan. Great for egg omelets. Highly recommend this product. Vast improvement over Teflon. Well manufactured and lid fits perfectly. Advertising by the company is true unlike some other products. Was debating going to the 10 inch but the 8 inch is perfect.
"I am not rating the durability because I just recently bought this skillet and so far have only used it twice. Each time it worked wonderfully and cleaned up easily. Hopefully, by following the manufacturer's instructions carefully, it will last a long time"
"This pan heats evenly. I make a vegetable hash every morning with about 4-7 different vegetables. I find this is just the right size for one person. It cleans up easier than any pan I have ever had. I have also scrambled eggs and veggie sausage together in it and it did an excellent job--no sticking at all. I am satisfied with this pan. Just be sure to keep it on moderate heat, not hot."
We have a Glass top stove and we have been using pans that are not completely flat on the bottom. It takes a long time to heat the entire pan. These Michelangelo pans have a solid flat bottom that works well with the Glass stove. Even heating and quicker heating times. Very easy to clean. Overall a very nice pan. I have bought 2 different sizes so far.
"I haven't had this pan for very long, but I find I am using it frequently. I especially like having a lid. This makes it easy to cook eggs, reheat pizza, and just generally cook anything you might cook in a frying pan. I have had no problems with cleaning the pan. It seems to heat evenly, which is appreciated. I don't really know how durable it will turn out to be, but no reason to mark it down so far."
"The fact that it doesn't have a lot of the nasty chemicals a lot of other non-sticks have and how well it works has me impressed so far. Can't speak to durability (construction seems solid though), but omelets and over easy eggs are easy to make in this pan. Exactly what I wanted and the lid is very useful. Cleaning is easy even when I'm lazy from a late night snack and leave it for the next morning (hand washing this only)"
"I ordered this set after my wife attended a salad master presentation that made her concern about our old set of non-stick with teflon coating that now shows a lot of scratch. I only had it for a week but I have used it multiple times already and it does what it says. I made fried rice, omelet and pancake without using any oil. I have also fried fish tilapa, sunny side up egg and banana que on it. cleaning is just like cleaning our corel plates. I have left the caramelized sugar overnight when I made the banana que and the sugar did get hard and sticked to the pan. I just put some water with soap on the pan and leave it for about 10 minutes and all the hardened sugar just came of.If you are used to teflon or anodized pan, you will need to be careful when frying on this pan as the items seem to slide easily on this pan. My first sunny side up ended up in the stove top when I was take it out of the pan.I only have this for a week so I have nothing to say about the longevity but it looks and feels just like my old pans with different coating."
My biggest concern is how even is the heat distribution. I own a larger one by another mfg. and it has poor heat distribution. This one is fine and cleans up easy. I have used it about 6 times and am pleased with this purchase. Grilled cheese sandwich comes out perfect and the lids helps with melting the cheese. My next concern is how the finish holds up. Since it cleans so easy I feel the finish should last. Time will tell. As of now I am happy with this product.
"We only used it twice, so far so good...A little advice cook on low heat, your food will taste better and your pots will last longer..I really love this pot, highly recommends it, my daughter use nothing but this to cook her pancake and my veggie patties taste delicious some I use a teaspoon of cold pressed coconut oil."
Didn’t realize you need a special pan for induction. I bought a green pan and everything was burning and not cooking evenly. This is a perfect size. Big and deep enough for large sauce dishes but also good for sautéing. Lid is a must.
"I feel a little goofy writing a review of a frying pan, but honest to God, this thing is like magic! Absolutely nothing sticks to it and it's a dream to clean. It cooks my omelettes to perfection! The clear lid is an incredible bonus. Love this thing!!"
I love this pan! It's the perfect size for camping and fits perfectly on a single burner camp stove. It takes less fuel to cook and the heat distribution is even from side to side. There is virtually no clean up. Mist it with white vinegar and wipe it out with a paper towel. Presto! Its immediately ready to use again. The price is incredible so having 2 would be more beneficial especially if you have a 2 burner propane camp stove.
"I bought this pan a couple of years ago, and recently bought one for my son and daughter-in-law. It is a perfect size for cooking single servings of sunny-side up eggs. Put a little butter in the pan, add two eggs, cook until whites show, add a little pepper, then add a tablespoon of water to pan, and cover for about two minutes. The secret is the lid! There are not many small pans that have lids, no less with a steam vent. Also, perfect size for omelets, and scrambled eggs. It’s a very sturdy, easy to clean pan, with a perfectly fitting lid."
I like this much better than the Blue Diamond brand. So far it is truly non-stick. I had bought a Blue Diamond skillet and within a couple of weeks it started sticking. I hate it. But this one seems to be working great! I am going to order another one.
"High quality, effective, good cooking tool. The only problem is that they are quite shallow. The manufacturer really should release a version 1/2-inch - 1 inch deeper. It would be great to use such a pan in a skillet scenario. If one existed, I would standardize to it immediately."
Great pan. It is very easy to clean and the heat distribution is great. We have been using it daily for the past 3 months or so and we have not seen any scratch on it. Great quality.
I was worried after reading reviews but I must have gotten a different pan because I've had no issues with sticking or cleaning. I use it daily. I love the lid. Pan is the perfect size for my eggs. Very happy with my purchase.
"Have been using this pan for 6 weeks now and absolutely love it. The surface is so slick that when stirring something, bits actually escape over the edge :-) Eggs and Omelettes come out easily and cleaning is super easy. I had to rethink how to use it though. Only for things that don’t need high heat. So I do meat in a different pan. No heating up the pan empty for too long, no sharp objects (I bought new spatulas to be safe). Two downsides: If for some reason you need oil, it collects around the rim as the pan is not completely flat. And obviously, no stacking with other pans to avoid scratches."
"This is a perfect size for an older single person who only cooks small dishes. This is my second Michelangelo pan of this size, I much prefer this coating to the stone coating I had before. It is more durable and easier to clean. The lid is also heavy duty and fits perfectly. This is an excellent pan for the money"
Husband was looking for a fry pan to cook his eggs in and wanted a lid. This was it! He loves it. Perfect in every way. Cooked eggs perfect and clean up could not be easier. Definitely recommend!
"I bought this pan specifically to fry my eggs how I like them...fast, with a runny yolk, and a lacy edge.  This pan does it well. You may not need to add fat for you applications, but a small amount goes a long way to keep ANYTHING i've cooked from sticking in the slightest.  The lid is a great fit for the pan, but may not fit other pans in your collection.  Wonderful pan, would definitely buy again...but hopefully I won't have to!"
"I'm still learning how to use my new induction cooktop but this little pan has made the learning curve easier. I bought a set of All Clad pots and pans, which I love, but when my son came to visit he had a hard time frying his eggs without having to scrub the pan. I ordered this one and two days later he's singing my praises at breakfast time. I'm considering getting the larger one next."
"I purchased the smallest pan a few years ago and completely ruined it last week by turning on the heat and walking away from the kitchen. ***Do not underestimate the **little** amount of heat needed to cook whatever you have in this.*** This is NOT like a regular pan. If you do not overheat the pan, it works like a dream, easy to clean and the finish doesn't degrade. I had the smaller pan for a few years before last weeks disaster of my own making. I liked the use of the small pan so much, purchased a replacement and also bought the next size up. These are great pans and I love the look too."
I didn't select 5 stars for durability as I just had this pan for 1 week. I absolutely love them! I bought the small and the big one. Is great to cook in something that your eggs won't stick to the pan. It keeps the heat nicely and doesn't burn your butter.
"I have 3 sized of the Michaelangelo pans 8, 10 and 12 inch. They are great fry pans and the lids are really nice also when needed. They clean really easily are are light in weight. I got them for Christmas and am really enjoying them."
"we needed an 8"" pan w/lid and this one was the best choice, we thought it a bit expensive, but it turned out to be perfect & worth every cent. Handle is never too hot, cleans up easy, and cooks evenly - omelets, chicken, pork everything comes out evenly cooked looking delicious"
"I liked the light weight of this pan & the easy & efficient clean up .I've used the word efficient because I have other glass lids that always water stain after washing no matter what I use.this one has turned out perfectly clear every time I wash it.So far I have cooked chicken patty's, turkey burger's & an egg white omelet.I'm very happy with this item."
"I had it for few days, and made some eggs. It is truly a nice looking pan with a cover! Please follow the instructions that is for low and medium heat...patience. 10/2020, I cooked some eggs on the pan for my son, he told me the eggs so tasty. Hence I brought him the pan as a gift on the Prime day."
I literally threw away my other pans when I received this one❣️Cleans so easy❣️Food comes right out❣️Easy to clean❣️What else can I ask for♥️❣️I’m love with this pan❣️I’m a real person just so you kniw❣️First name Alexis♥️
The real surprise - the pan comes with a cover. Truly a blessing. The weight of the pan is excellent. Very happy with this purchase.
"This pan is perfect for eggs! (Scrambled or fried) Easy clean up, Price is reasonable. I think the key on these pans is to not to over heat them on the highest heat, however they are not as good on induction as cast iron or pots and pans that are specifically made for induction. The more magnetic the pan is the better it works with induction."
"This pan is great, i was using a old beat up pan that always got things stuck on it, and when i got this pan it just feels like it made everything easier, i cook chicken and eggs and salmon and nothing sticks to it, its satisfyingly easy to clean, the lid is awesome too so i dont get hot oil all over the place"
"First the size, I was initially concerned over the size due to the area of heating surface, but heat distribution on this pan is incredible. I really appreciate the high sides of the pan and the amount of food that can be cooked in this pan. I have made several meals with this with various items and it stands behind it's non-stick surface advertisement.  The handle is made of a quality rubber and does not get hot when used for long periods of time. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a quality, non-stick frying pan."
"So far have had this pan a few months after our previous name brand expensive non stick had several scratches and it creeped me out knowing who knows what was leaking into the food so I tossed it. So far this one is great, super easy to use and clean! Great value too"
"I was very apprehensive buying this pan when there were so many more to choose from, and much more expensive. This pan has been a life saver, and the easiest to clean of all my other pans. I always use wooden or silicone utensils on all my pans that are non-stick, and I believe I'll be using this one for a very long time. Very well made and not too heavy. Well worth the purchase!"
"This pan should NOT be this inexpensive! Wow! It’s AMAZING! The non-stick coating is perfect, the thickness is great, it’s a nice, large size, and it’s aesthetic as heck! Love it!!!"
"This is a great pan. I needed new pans, my non-stick pans were T-fal; very good to me for many many years, but worn out. I read many revews of many pans. Many reviews would rave on a pan, then others would say they suck. This pan had the best reviews, so I took a chance. Wow. I didn't realize how bad my pans were until I got this one! This pan is durable and heats evenly. I use it at least twice a day. Easy to clean, wipe with paper towel or a quick scrub with hot water, soft, brush, a dab of soap. Nothing sticks. I can use less oil when cooking. I like that the flat cooking surface is very large, I can cook a fried egg on one side and a scramble on the other. I can tell it's gonna be great for pancakes. Just make sure you read the instructions that come with it and season the pan before use to make the non-stick magic happen."
I have gone through 2 non stick skillets. I treat them with care and my last one didn't last but a few months. So I bought this one in hopes that it will last. I have so far not been disappointed. I seasoned it just like the instructions said and it has worked wonderfully. I used it daily and love it.
"This pan is great for the price. It has heat spots, but I can live with them. I’m happy with my purchase. Update: The handle is a bit flimsy. I started tossing some wontons in oil and could feel the handle move."
I love my new pan...and I will not take points away for not having a lid but I sure would love to know if there is a universal lid that fits this pan? The pan is just a bit wider than 12.5 so my universal lid isn't quite big enough. Thank you.
"There were so many to chose from but I finally settled on this (its from Amazon after all!) BOY, am I glad I did, nothing sticks to it! SO easy to clean! and it was reasonably priced. Glad I found it"
Great pan for the money. It's crazy what their asking for a fry pan these days. This pan is one quarter the money and does everything the $100 pan will do. It really is a no brainer when but a fry pan.
"This pan is really good for the price. The sides are a bit low, but that is ok."
Just used this pan last night and the omelette I made practically slid off into my plate. Easy to clean and seems durable. I would definitely purchase this pan again !!!
Like this pan a lot. It's large but could probably be a little deeper. Seems to heat evenly. Everyone likes using it and it cleans very easily. Good purchase.
Excellent pan with fantastic non stick properties. Great value!
Only owned for couple months but these pans are a value buy and cook/clean very well. Pleased with purchase
"Only had the pan for a couple weeks, but so far, so good. Nice not stick. Good weight. Cooks well"
Just bought it. Works great so far. Can't wait to see how long it lasts.
"This is a great skillet, cook a evenly, easy clean, holds a lot."
Fantastic skillet. Very pleased with purchase.
Don't hesitate from buying this pan Cooks evenly and I love the big size of the pan Great buy for an unbelievable price!!!
"This pan is great, only complaint is that it’s bigger than our burner so sometimes the heat distribution is off."
Seems to be on par with top rated OXO pan of the same size and specs
Like the no stick.
it seems dose not burning out so much air/gas like other similar pan.
"This pan really is non stick. It doesn't take much to clean it and I can finally make eggs again without regretting it. It's bigger than I expected, so it's a lot to fit in the sink or in the cabinets. However, it also fits three sandwiches in the pan, and is the same size as the largest burner on my stove. I have only used it a few times, but my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. I might look for more sizes of the same style."
Very nice pan it is truly non -stick.
I’m shocked at how great this pan is. I’ve had it for a few weeks and it hasn’t disappointed
I've used this pan many times now and there is no warping or problems of any kind. I loved it so much I went back and bought the two smaller sizes. They all heat evenly and clean up is a breeze. Very good pan at a great price.
First time in my life I've experienced eggs actually sliding out of a pan! Be sure to follow the seasoning instructions that come with the shipment.
Quality and value
I love this skillet. It’s large enough to hold up to 8 chicken thighs. It cooks evenly and food cooks through.
It is a nice pan but I did underestimate the size even though it said 12 inches. It is great for making a double batch of something.
"This is a nice xtra large pan. This is the biggest one that I own. We use the lid from our wok for it as it is huge and none of my other lids fit it including my universal lid. It has held up well in the dishwasher, transfers heat evenly and is capable of searing quite nicely. We have had it for about 6 months. Great product!"
Priced right and it works great.
"This is a solid pan that does want it's supposed to. I have no complaints. It is fairly light for the size, very non-stick and easy to clean. Heat distribution could be better, but it is also a standard aluminum construction pan. Does well for what it is. The bottom is a nice matte charcoal black color, and is holding up well to the abuse of being pulled and pushed across electric heating elements.  My biggest complaint is the packaging it arrived in. SO much unnecessary cardboard and plastic liners on and around the pan. The handle had a wrapper, then another wrapper over the whole pan, cardboard trays in various shapes to provide a chair for the pan, a support tray in the middle of the pan to support the lid of the box, etc. There has got to be a middle ground between unsafe storage and shipping conditions for the pan and this amount of wasteful packaging...."
"Have had the pan for a few weeks, seems alright so far. Gas stove, I've been avoiding turning the burner to the highest heat, since the instructions said it might damage the pan, and using a plastic spatula and handwashing only. Nonstick coating still perfect after daily use for a few weeks. Very easy to clean, just needs a few wipes with a sponge and a bit of soap.  Very large in diameter, almost like a shallow wok. Heats a bit unevenly because it's larger than my burner. Works alright for stir fry or regular frying in medium quantities, for large amounts I still use my regular wok."
"Love the pan bought the 3 piece set saw that they were good so went ahead and picked this one up aswell need to replace my calphalon ones very similar.these are perfect love the material,thickness and all good quality,good price."
"Bottom and sides are thin, but not too thin. Good heat distribution. Replaced a similar sized skillet, and I had forgotten what a good non-stick coating was like. Highly recommended as a basic for your kitchen."
"Nice fry pan and a great price. However the lack of a coordinating lid makes this one a nonstarter. The pan is a lick bigger than other pans —which would be great again if Amazon sold a lid to go with it, but since they don’t you will have no luck finding a lid from even a different brand that will fit. tldr, you use a lid often cooking? This isn’t the pan for you."
"What you cant tell from the pics is that the product is about half as heavy as something like the tramontina or the clipper brand. The coating is fine, but that lack of weight is going to negativtly effect how well you can use this. Do not recommend. Spend the extra $10 for another brand."
Glad I purchased it. Very easy to use and clean. Good quality
Perfect size. Durable. Dishwasher safe. Exactly what I wanted
"So far, we love this Pan. Not only is it easy to clean, but also it cooks everything we’ve made quite nicely."
We loved our last amazon basics pan and we love almost everything about this one. We did have a problem with the bottom finish melting onto our stove top. We hope we can scrape it off. We will return this one and let Amazon workshop this item a bit more and maybe try it again in the future. See pic.
Love this pan ! As a mother of 4 it definitely comes in handy ! Will buy again when this one gets old .
Amazing Amazon!! I am surprised that the quality is great and price is low!!
I'm really liking this skillet. Does not stick and easy clean-up!
I was skeptical at the low price...but boy have I ever been pleased! This is one of the best pan's I've bought. I'm going to start looking at other Amazon Basic products. I'm very impressed! Happy customer!
"Easy to clean, very effective nonstick coating. It seems like a more expensive pan."
My teenage son already scratched it! 😡 But I Still love and will purchase a new one.
Finally an actual non stick pan! This one is great and cook even and well. No sticking and great price.
Couldn't be happier. Easy to clean bottom
"These aren't light-weight pans. They are heavy and well-made. So far the coating has lasted and shows no scratches. Of course, I'm careful about using plastic utensils."
Easy cleaning heavy large size durable.
"Easy to maintain and it cooks perfectly. Much better than Tfal, and I thought that was good."
I’ve had it for a few months and it’s like new!
"It hold up well with high heats like steak, yet very easy to clean."
"Only used it a few times. Works as advertised, frying bacon cannot get any better."
"Good quality, cooks evenly, easy to clean. Glad I purchased it."
"Great pan, nonstick is great, and easy to clean. My only issue is that it's not a standard size so my normal lids don't fit on it."
"Very nice pan heats evenly , super non-stick, good weight, good price."
"It was great at first. Nothing stuck to it. But after having this pan for a few months it's no longer ""non-stick"". Have to use lots of elbow grease to remove stuck food in the sink. Will be throwing it away."
Good size and heating
The coating scratched off after the first use. Cooked pancakes and used a plastic spatula. I thought the coating on the pan would have been better.
I NEED A WHOLE SET !
"Been using for about 3 weeks and use it almost every day. Eggs, meat, bacon. Nothing sticks and it leans up great! I spent hundreds on that copper crap and this blows that away!"
"This pan is great! Large surface area, easy to clean and foods cook evenly!"
Great product
This pan is pretty big. I love the fact that it makes cooking easier for big families. Easy to clean also.
"Easy to use, non stick and very duarable. Im happy with the purchase"
"So far, this is a very nice pan. It remains to be seen how long the finish lasts but I have high hopes because the pan heats up very nicely at a low temperature. Another nice feature is that it is recommended that you preheat the pan for 2-3 minutes on low heat. As usual with nonstick pans, the directions say to use lower heat levels and that is not a problem because I got a great cook on a browned butter sauce I was making and never had to turn my electric burner higher than 1.5 out of 10 on the dial. And clean up was a snap! This is also a good-sized pan at 11+ inches in diameter and about 3.5 inches deep.  The handle has a soft touch, and it didn’t get hot for the time I was using it, but the directions do say it can get hot after a prolonged cooking time. The little helper handle is another story altogether. I touched it to lift the pan to pour out the contents and, yikes! That was hot! Remember to keep a potholder nearby and use it! The lid, which is not vented, fits on the pan nicely and the inside of the lid has those little bumps that allow moisture to return to what is being cooked. Because the pot handle feels like silicone, I thought I’d be able to put the pan in the oven and I checked the directions to see the maximum temperature and was surprised to read that I should never put this pan in the oven. That’s a bit of a bummer for me but not a dealbreaker.  Included is a wooden spatula that is safe for the pan’s finish, but the directions say silicone, my preference, can also be used. Speaking of directions, there’s a lot to read, and they are printed on a little card that is attached to the pan handle. I use reading glasses, but I had to go find a magnifying glass to read the tiny print. It is worth reading anyway so this pan can last a good long time."
"Goodful All-In-One Pan, Multilayer Nonstick, High-Performance Cast Construction, Multipurpose Design Replaces Multiple Pots and Pans, Dishwasher Safe Cookware, 11-Inch, 4.4-Quart Capacity, Terracotta is one of the most beautiful pans I've ever seen. It is sturdy and well-constructed, the handle stays cool, and it cooks food evenly. It holds a ton of food so it is perfect for large family meals. I love this pan, especially the color and design which is totally unique. It even comes with a substantial wooden spoon. Highly recommend."
"My only disappointment for this pan is its not oven safe, so I can't cook items that start on the cook top and finish in the oven under the broiler.  We have an induction cooktop and this pan works on it very well. It tends to be a little slower to heat up then cast iron, but it certainly isn't slow enough to be a deal killer.  The pan is extremely light weight given its size.  The non-stick coating is outstanding, I have cooked just about every nasty sticky thing I can think of in it. Particularly I made brown sugar sauce that almost always burns to the sides of my other pans and is a pain to get off. It came off this pan with just a quick wipe.  This is an excellent sauce pan with deep sides that does double duty as fry pan. Highly recommended."
"My pans were showing their wear. This came up and looked like a nice pan and it is!  11” multipurpose pan for many cooking needs. Great size and holds a lot. This pan comes in different colors but this Terracotta color is beautiful and has a rich, earthy tone. Not heavy at all to lift. There is rubber on the handle for easy gripping. Includes a Beechwood turner tool which is a nice addition.  I like the deepness of the pan which is great when your dishes have a sauce such as beef stroganoff. It hold a lot and I love the non-stick surface. I was able to cook the meat and sauce all in one pot. Cleaning it was easy as I quickly rinsed it out and scrubbed it lightly with a sponge and soap. Easy peazy. It does say you can put this entire pan and lid in the dishwasher. Just do not put the included spoon in the dishwasher. I have not tried this yet since it takes up so much room in the dishwasher I will probably always just hand wash it.  Great pan for many uses! Great to give as a gift or gift it to yourself!"
"This is a very efficient and functional pan. It's not only very nice looking, the quality is excellent. Truly non-stick it has cooked up pasta sauce beautifully and it has a nice deep design which allows me to put the pasta directly in the sauce without any problems. The handle is soft and does not get hot while cooking. Comes with a lid and a very nice wooden spoon. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone. This is now my go to pan in the house. Love the way it cooks my food!"
"I am coming into my own as my family’s personal chef and I look forward to using this pan for all my culinary needs. This pan reminds me of a lightweight cast-iron skillet, one in which I own, but I can’t seem to keep the cast-iron in workable condition, and I am excited that this pan allows me to use it as such without all the hassle of a cast-iron skillet. With limited cabinet space, I am excited to have one that does the work of several. I love the light weight rubber handle, sleek design, and the fact that it can go inside the oven as well as on the stove top for easy cooking. You get a wooden spoon as a treat. Cast-iron handles tend to get hot over the cooking period, I love that the rubbery feel of the handle controls the heat and I’m not gonna burn myself if I touch it, in addition to the helper handle on the side for easy maneuvering. One of the most thoughtful features is the indentation on the handle that allows your thumb to fall into place for comfortable handling. This skillet is compatible with glass, electric, gas, and induction stoves. It is dishwasher safe and since it’s nonstick should be easy to clean. I will update the review once I complete a meal in the skillet. So far I am extremely pleased with what I received."
"Oh this pan is wonderful. Let me start off by saying when I got this pan my husband looked at me and said “really another pan?” After the first time he used it now we fight over who gets to use it. Of course my favorite thing to cook on it is eggs, the nonstick surface works so well it makes sunny side up eggs or fried eggs a breeze. I do think it cooks a little cooler than normal pans so I haven’t really tried pan frying anything in it yet. But I have made so much in it from Curries to breakfast etc. The pan feels and cooks with great quality. I enjoy the free wooden spoon it came with. And the instructions are quite clear if you read them all on how to properly take care of the pan."
"I got this because my wife was looking for a pan this kind of size but deeper so she could mix sauces without losing a lot over the edge of a shallower pan.  She absolutely loves this pan. It's deep enough to make sauce without rolling out a much deeper pan, shallow enough to fry eggs and burgers and the like, and non-stick which makes it easy to clean. It even comes with a wooden spatula, which is a nice touch.  Thanks to getting this pan she's got rid of a couple of her older pans that were showing their age. This is her go-to pan for quite a few uses now."
"I've been seeing the trend for these ""all in one ""pans. That are supposed to replace multiple kitchen pans, some of them even go into the oven. This one does not go into the oven. Slight disappointment from the oven aside, I decided to put it to the test.  Out of the package it's quite impressive. Mine is a beautiful very pale purple/lilac color. It is very strong and sturdy. I am very impressed with how strong the cover is. The handle is slightly padded. Comfort & heat control. The inside is coated & looks to be a very strong durable coating.  At first I didn't feel like it would be big enough to do anything with. Anything significant. It's 4.4 quarts, I am happy to report that my assumption was quite wrong.  Last night after a gentle cleaning I am happy to say I put my beautiful purple pan to the test.  I decided to create a meal that would do everything in the pan.  I sautéed garlic, vegetables, chickpeas, I boiled rice/cooked rice, fried veggie burgers, etc.  And it was great because it was literally a quick wipe out in between, if that was even necessary.  The nonstick coating is a beautiful substance in this pan.  And what I like about the pan is that everything is made with quality. You don't feel like you're going to get pieces of ""nonstick coating"" in your food when it gets older, like other pans I have purchased  I was able to boil pasta for FOUR ppl in this!  Impressed.  It comes with a great Beechwood Turner/spatula which worked perfect for multiple steps.  Cleanup was a breeze as well.  Overall it IS a gorgeous, well made pan & it does replace multiple items."
"I absolutely love this all in one pan. Not only is it aesthetically beautiful, it is just the perfect size, depth, and weight to make a variety of recipes. On a recent camping trip, I brought this pan and made banana bread pancakes in it. I sprayed a light layer of coconut oil on it, and the pancakes slid right off once cooked. They cooked uniformly and the cleanup was a breeze. Back at home, I like to use it as a wok and make quick stir fry noodles and vegetables. I highly recommend this pan."
"I use this pan almost every day. It's the perfect size for all the one-pot meals I love to make. It's lightweight but cooks like a heavyweight pan. The nonstick is incredible, even melted cheese slides right out, so cleanup is quick and simple. It has deep sides and a lid that fits snugly, and is a beautiful terracotta. The handle is a soft rubber that fits comfortably in my hand. It says it's oven safe, but I haven't tried that."
"I'll start by saying that I have several pots and pans that include one cast iron, a set of relatively high end stainless steel, several traditional nonstick options, and yes I use Instant Pots, Sous Vide and other gadget like options for convenience. I just want people to generally know that I enjoy cooking; I like kitchen items... that I use. I don't consider myself a home chef so much as someone who likes to cook and is inspired enough to cook for other as a host.  Okay, with my mild credentials listed, let's talk about this every day pan. Now there are a lot of ways someone could describe a pan like this, and Goodful prefers to call it All-in-One, Always Pan or even multipurpose. Compared to other brands though, they used to call pans that are expected to be used often in a variety of ways to be called an Everday Pan that is nonstick. I have a couple of these, and their's shallower and heavier than this one, which is why I am going to step over here and explain why I kind of love this pan.  First it's deep. This can make people instantly think well then it's a pot, made to simmer and is too heavy to move much. Well it's large but not heavy, so you can actually pick it up and manipulate it with the the long handle and the shorter one... easily. It's pretty. I mean seriously as soon as I saw it, I wondered what other colors it came in because I want to add it to other kitchens! And yes, it comes out in a pretty box that fits exactly what my title says, it's giftable. Now I am not saying you should ditch jewelry and roses and fine products for this for your SO; I'm just saying it has that extra that if someone you care about and love enjoys receiving kitchen items, this one just feels... special when it comes to apperances.  Now outside appearances and on to use, I really like cooking in this. It looks fine to sit on the counter top and functions exactly as it says, useful for simmering, frying, just everyday use expect for a small amount of sauce which this is too big for. I like using nonstick, but really longevity is going to tell me how well this last. After cooking sticky (read has sugar in it), sauces and meals in here, it was very easy to clean. This is true for most nonstick options right up until they stop being nonstick. I am hugely hopeful this quality product will last longer than the other ones I've had. Only time will tell for sure, but I'm not kidding about wanting to gift this to someone. I have one in mind already, and am trying to figure out the appropriate color. This person is a HomeGoods kind of person, which has all these interesting shades, and I realize I am just not sure what color she enjoys most, but I think there will be one close to what she loves the most.  Great pan!"
"I literally have been cooking since I was 8, my parent encouraged their offspring to experiment, be bold and enjoy cooking. Later they owned a gourmet cookware store that I ran for a while and what I learned could fill several books.  This pan seemed to be o bit oversold in their description but I know and understand that subtle difference can make a huge difference in how well a pan is suited for cooking, so here goes, my opinion on how well this one is up to its promises.  WHAT I LOOK FOR  The first thing I look at is the bottom of any pan. I am the unfortunate owner of a brand new range that has a glass cooking surface. They are very trendy but rank at the bottom of my list for how well they cook. They are very sensitive to the kind of pan you uses, despite what the makers tell you. The bottom has to be perfectly flat and the exact diameter of the active area (the area that lights up) and one of the major drawbacks is unlike most other cooking surfaces, it is very difficult to center your pan right over the active area and keep it there while you swish the ingredients around. Glass tops also do not do well with stainless steel or other non-porous cookware, which is to say most of it in my kitchen. Advantage one with this pan is that the bottom has what I would call shallow air holes or semi perforations - small indentations that trap heat and distribute it to the cooking surface inside. I would think that would be an advantage no matter what kind of stove you use.  Second, and related to the above, is that this is an 11 inch pan, smaller than some and larger than others but for glass top elements it seems perfect. Unless you are cooking for a very large family this seems to be an ideal everyday pan.  Next, and the first thing many people look at, is the coating inside. These days we don’t have to worry about non-stick coatings peeling off and ending up in our stomachs. Most are very durable and live up to their name of being non-stick. I can’t see any major differences or advantages to this one other than I’ve started to get used to a white interior and this dark brown means I have to have more light on over my cooktop to see most foods inside the pan. Not a deal breaker but not my first choice. Also this one doesn’t feel as smooth to the touch but I don’ think that would affect it in terms of non-stick ability.  The cover is cast aluminum, which is kind of rare, most now are see-through glass. As a cook I believe an aluminum lid is capable of reflecting and returning more heat to the food being cooked. It would be my choice for anything that requires simmering, braising or other lid on cooking. Two things to note - one is that there is no ventilation hole in the lid. That is neither a pro nor a con, sometimes you want to let some steam vent out and sometimes you want a tightly sealed lid. The other thing is that the inside surface of the lid is dimpled, which helps it return condensation to the food in evenly spaced drips. It’s a minor advantage but appreciated when you lift the lid and all of the condensation doesn’t drain all over your stovetop.  Other than that are personal preference things like the silicone handle (but I have pans with all metal handles and have never burned myself), and the extra little grip opposite the handle. Unfortunately it really is little and not easy to grab with oven mitts on, which is the only way I would recommend using it because it gets VERY hot - never touch it without mitts on. Likewise with the knob on top, grab it wrong and you could have scorched knuckles.  LIVING UP TO PROMISES  Does this pan live up to its promises? Pretty much and although it seems like a lot to pay, cookware is very expensive these days so they are in the right ballpark. I have been grabbing it first from my selection of several similar fry pans and I like the slightly smaller size, the higher sides and the aluminum lid. It definitely could qualify as an all in one for someone’s first kitchen or those who don’t cook a lot. It’s definitely better than something you would find at a discount store, it’s very heavy.  YES OR NO  There is no way to open this the day you get it and declare it great or terrible, such reviews mean nothing. It takes several months of use to discover it it will warp or the coating with scratch or the handle will fall off. Hopefully none of these will happen so for now I am giving it five stars because it does what they say it will and I’m finding that this in-between size is far better suited to most everyday tasks than the more trendy larger pans being pushed in ads. I find I am picking it first from my cupboard for everyday cooking and that’s just what it’s made for. I like it."
"It's a nice thought and genius advertising slant to say that this one piece of cookware could replace your fry pan, sauté pan, saucepan, stockpot, non-stick pan, wok, skillet and braiser, but that's not the reality. You can indeed use this as a fry pan, sauté pan, saucepan, non-stick pan, skillet and braiser (stovetop only), though. The problem is with the limitations of aluminum coated cookware.  As a fry pan, this works well. It's deep enough for burgers, chops, and the like. Makes easy work of a big batch of scrambled eggs or French toast. Yes, this works as a fry pan.  As a deep fryer, this pan doesn't quite meet the goal. It's not deep enough to cover anything but small pieces of food. For something like frying chicken, the oil quantity isn't deep enough to even cover drumsticks. Smaller things such as chicken wings, fries, breaded mushrooms, etc.,do fine as this pan can be done, but larger items like bone-in chicken breasts will possibly require flipping to cover all sides. It can be done, but this isn't a deep fryer in the sense that you can use a dutch oven to fry foods because it's just not deep enough. Kind of yes, this will work as a deep fryer in a limited capacity.  As a sauté pan, saucepan, and skillet, this pan handles what you need it to do. It conducts heat well and heats pretty evenly. Sides are high enough to help prevent minor splatters when cooking pork chops, burgers, Hamburger Helper, so on and so forth. So yes, this works as all three of these pans.  As a braiser, this pan kind-of-sort-of works this way. It works for smaller roasts or chickens, and the lid fits tight enough to keep the moisture and heat in. If making smaller meals, then yes, this works as a braiser.  Now for the problems. While the soft grip, silicone handle is great when cooking on the stovetop because it doesn't get hot like a full metal handle would, it also means you can't put this pan in the oven to finish off your steaks, or under the broiler to melt cheese on the pasta dish you just finished.  As a stockpot, no, this isn't a stockpot by any stretch. It's not deep enough to make batches of soup, pots of pasta, or anything that needs a lot of liquid. This isn't made for boiling pasta or potatoes or a couple dozen pierogis. It's not deep enough to hold enough water plus whatever food you want to cook. Well, maybe if you are only making enough for one or two people, but for a family of four or for a large batch of macaroni for a picnic? Just not enough room.  As a wok, well, this isn't a wok. If you use a wok frequently, then you will understand WHY this isn't the same as a wok, even by a long shot. Having the dome-shape is important when cooking authentic Chinese food. It’s easier to stir and toss the food, easier to control the heat (with a gas stove - crucial for stir frying), easier heat the wok super hot which shorten cooking time which makes the food will taste better. A great wok will also last a lifetime (and then some) if properly maintained. This Goodful pan isn't going to last nearly that long. Starting with a pan like this is probably easier for cooks new to cooking foods typically cooked in a wok, but as skills are learned most cooks move up to a true wok as the food just tastes better when properly made. A wok can also be used to braise, deep fry, fry, sear, sauté, make popcorn, and it's deep enough to boil pasta and potatoes, and a well maintained wok is even non-stick.  Is this a good pan that can be used in multiple ways, yes. Is the be-all-end-all of pans? No. A wok can be used to replace the same various pans Goodful says this one does, but it will be around for a lot longer. A same sized cast iron pan can do the same things too, and it will last for decades if properly cared for. Stainless steel cookware will also usually outlive aluminum, though unlike cast iron it can't be seasoned to develop a nonstick cooking surface. Aluminum, especially coated like this one is, is easy to clean, at least until the coating becomes damaged which it eventually will, especially if washed in the dishwasher. Cleaning in the dishwasher versus hand washing will erode the coating a lot faster. Once the coating is damaged, it becomes advisable to not use aluminum cookware. Aluminum reacts poorly with acidic foods and alters the taste. Aluminum can also leach into foods when a pan's coating is scratched/damaged, and studies show this can lead to damage to bone cells and negative health problems for those with kidney issues. Aluminum might be great for heating up quickly, but it doesn't hold heat well and cannot be used with higher temperatures (above 464 degrees). For cooks who frequently use high heat for searing, browning, or oven work, aluminum cookware is not an option. Aluminum cookware like this pan is cheaper than stainless steel or cast iron, but the trade-off is a much shorter lifespan. It's just not as rugged and is much more prone to warping. Stainless and cast iron cookware both require continual upkeep and are usually more expensive than aluminum. Metal or sharp edged utensils shouldn't be used with coated aluminum cookware, while stainless steel and cast iron have no such restrictions. Aluminum is a better choice for those looking to reduce the amount of cooking oil used when pan frying foods. Aluminum is also typically the cheapest option for cookware, though with this pan coming in at $80, I'm no so sure about that. For the same price, you can buy a quality stainless steel or cast iron piece of the same size that, with a little more attention, will be a piece of cookware you very likely will never have to replace. So while I might like the nonstick surface and handle that doesn't get hot and how lightweight this pan is, for the price I would have to recommend that for a savvy consumer who loves to cook, you should really consider buying a stainless steel or cast iron option instead. It's not worth the price or few minor conveniences to buy cookware that will need to be replaced in a few years."
"I like it and plan to use it almost daily- but I wouldn’t use the word “love” about it. Mostly because at the end of the day it’s still an aluminum pan. It feels mega lightweight and flimsy to the touch when you handle after high end cookware. I’m used to costly cookware typically being made of stainless steel or enameled cast iron and this feels a lot less of a lifetime-long pot and more of a “perfect for right now” sort of pot/pan. The same “it’s so lightweight” complaint I have about it though would be the total selling point for my mom who can’t really lift and move around my heavy enameled cast iron cookware well- so it’s personal preference at the end of the day on the weight of it. I could see the lighter weight and versatility of it also being a huge seller for someone in an RV or vanlife type of situation where they don’t want the weight and want minimal cookware. It’s a beautiful light lavender color. The color of it brings me a lot of joy and looks so stylish and cute. The size is excellent for one pot meals. We built up a stir fry rice in it and also stir fry vegetables and it worked out excellent. The whole inside is mega nonstick and even sticky things like eggs just slide around and come right out and don’t leave a mess at ALL. You really don’t need much if any oils and butters to cook with it, which is great for cutting back on calories in your dishes. I like that it has the top- so if you want your veggies or whatever to get a few minutes of a steam on them you can easily just pop the lid on. The top non style handle and the side handle have a soft coating on them that feels nice to the touch. It’s great that it comes with a wooden spoon/spatula, as I wouldn’t want to ever use metal utensils on this so it doesn’t get scratched. The packaging is super good- it’s well protected in a decorated cardboard packed box. So most of the packaging can be recycled (except for the coated tags and plastic wrap around the pieces). It feels like a little event to open it though so it would be packed nice to gift or mail gift to somebody. Overall I’d recommend it."
"Review of the Goodful All-In-One Pan, Multilayer Nonstick, High-Performance Cast Construction, Multipurpose Design Replaces Multiple Pots and Pans, Dishwasher Safe Cookware, 11-Inch, 4.4-Quart Capacity, Crimson Red  Don’t forget to season the pan BEFORE you start to cook with it. We washed ours first then, after it dried, I took some olive oil and rubbed it into the pan with a paper towel before cooking.  I used this pan for a breakfast fry-up yesterday. I boiled my potatoes in another pot, but could have used this one. While they were boiling, I heated up some brown and serve sausages in this pan then took them out to drain and put in some olive oil and a pat of butter and fried the boiled potatoes in it. I like them good and brown and usually this would end in burned layer of oil, butter mixture, but not in this pan. I slid them to one side, added some more oil and butter and added my mixed up eggs to the pan to scramble. I used the wooden spatula that came with the pan to shove the potatoes around, stir the eggs, and mix the eggs with the potatoes, then I cut up the drained sausages and added them back in. This pan worked like a champ through all phases of this fried meal. The handle is insulated and does not get hot quickly (use caution, long cook times may allow handle to heat). See attached photo I am holding the handle while the sausages are cooking.  Cleanup was easy. After the pan cooled down, I rinsed it out with a Teflon scrubby and any residue just came right off, nonstick as advertised.  Pleased with the pan. I can see using it for braising meat, frying pork chops or chicken, then adding soups for casseroles (the soup usually is hard to get off my stainless steel pans. I think this one will work better) the large size is perfect for those activities because I make casseroles for two or three days.  Nice pan, good quality item."
"I do most of my cooking in a few sizes of cast iron skillets. This fits between the 10 and 12 inch, but the high sides make it super versatile for a lot of the types of meals I cook. Particularly 'one pot' meals, or ones that wind up in this one pot - like building a sauce and adding in pasta or a giant pile of spinach or kale. It has a ton of vertical space.  Big pro - it is WAY lighter than the 12 inch cast iron. And of course it is, aluminum is light. It's also very good at heating, and the alu here is very thick. It's quite a sturdy pan that I think will look great for years to come.  Pro - Seems to be very nonstick in the several times I've used it, while still being able to brown food nicely. Hopefully the coating remains this way and doesn't lose its capability in a short time like some of the 'green' pans I've used.  Pro - Induction capable! Aluminum doesn't work on induction, but they added a steel plate on the bottom of the pan for this purpose. It isn't shown in any photos - perhaps I'll add one to this review.  Cons - I don't know if this is oven safe at all. Doesn't say anywhere, and it has a slightly soft handle which makes me wonder how it would fare in the hot box. Not gonna risk it.  -The color might not be everyone's cup of tea. It certainly stands out amongst my black iron and stainless steel.  All in all, I've found myself reaching for this pan a lot these last couple of weeks and I LOVE my cast iron, so that is saying something. If you're looking for a big, easy to maneuver, high sided saute pan, this could be an excellent fit!"
"Now and then I need my bigger skillet and this does my 3lbs of hamburger meat and sauce with no problem. I really wanted this to match my current red set of pots and pans, but I must admit I like this better than the stainless steel one I was using. It seems like it was built to handle heavy duty tasks, but I really only use it to get my sauce ready when I make pasta dishes. Mainly lasagna. I get two casserole dishes from it. Enough for dinner and leftovers! I attribute the extra inch in depth for this being better than my previous one which is about the same size, just probably a quart less. It’s perfect for my pasta sauce needs. My only complaint is the mess I make getting rid of the grease when my hamburger meat is done. I’m cost effective and don’t waste paper towels, aluminum foil and other consumable ways of collecting it to save my pipes from unnecessary clogging. I recycle used peanut butter, mayo, butter jars and tubs leaving them in the freezer to pour the grease into. The smaller the opening, the more of a mess I seem to make. I don’t think I’d want a pour spout because that would have a negative impact on the skillets design. Perhaps someone will invent an attachment you can place along the edge to help with the messy draining because I do like the nice round look and the nice seal the lid makes with this skillet. I’m sure that will be helpful for some folks using this as a Dutch oven. I can tell this will end up being one of my favorite dishes!"
"This heavy duty all in one pan has been a blessing!  Upon arrival I was immediately impressed with how well it was packaged and upon opening the packaging I was so happy with how well this item is made.  It truly does so many multiple things in my kitchen that I have not used another pan in nearly one week now.  It's a lovely shade of light purple, a very flattering pretty color, the lid is heavy duty, I love the padded feelings to the handle, the nonstick coating is very heavy duty but isnt the old fashioned unhealthy version.  I used the pan just last night to boil elbow macaroni's, and sauté a variety of garlic and vegetables, then everything was combined in one pan to create a lovely meal.  It was very nice to quickly wipe the pan out, a quick washing with a soft sponge and soap, and I was good to go.  The quality and use of this pan gives you back the investment tenfold very quickly.  It comes with a nice wood turner/stirrer/spatula.  I've used it multiple times already. I was very leery that red sauce would stain it but so far so good. I like that this item is strong enough to flip over French toast, pancakes, even scrambled eggs, and there is no damage to the multi use wood spoon or the pan."
"I expected this pan to be much heavier than it is. It is 3"" deep! Much deeper than it looked in the product presentation - and that is a positive thing. The thermal distribution and uniformity of this pan are two areas of excellence as well. I understand that the constituent of the pan is aluminum but I've never seen of felt whatever substance that they coated the cooking surface with. Nothing stuck to it at all. Extremely easy to clean with soap, water and a cotton dish rag. I cooked breakfast and dinner on this pan yesterday and I absolutely love it! It is my new go-to. In all likelihood I'll just keep it on the stove top. With it's complimentary red color and streamlined artistic good looks it's a natural in my kitchen. As I mentioned before, the interior coating is really smooth. I looked at it under magnification and could not see any porosity, even where the interior (brown) coating transitions to the outer coating (red) there is no break in the surface. Fantastic but very uncommon to see. As a bonus, the wooden turner is quite functional with it's radiused edge and dished surface. They didn't leave out any of the important details. This pan far exceeded my expectations and has become a daily use item. Two thumbs up to the people at Goodful...they did it right!"
"Goodful All-In-One Pan, Multilayer Nonstick, High-Performance Cast Construction is a pretty lilac (!) pan with a snug-fitting lid. I have to admit that one of the aspects that I like about this pan is the lilac color (lilac?!)--weird cookware is just so interesting. I have some very oddly colored Le Creuset that I absolutely adore, because it makes a splash on the table.  Anyway, this pan is lighter than it looks like it will be. It's a sturdy, workhorse sort of pan; we use it for just about everything. I love the depth. It's deeper than many other saute pans of the same diameter, so I can make sauces in it, which I can't do with the other pans.  You can use this on an induction stovetop, which is a plus (my father insists he's going to get me a countertop induction cooktop; he adores his). It comes with a wooden spoon, as to keep the inside of the pan scratch-free.  This pan comes in a range of fun colors, and the price point is a bit lower than other premium brands. I have used Goodful in the past, and it's an excellent brand (that hasn't worn out yet after a number of years, so...). The pan is multi-use, colorful, non-stick, and practical. Highly recommended."
"This is a great all-in-one pan. It is a well-made pan and lid. I love that it is red (my favorite color). It also comes with a beechwood turner. The pan does need to be washed and seasoned before you use it the first time (only takes a few minutes). It does a wonderful job at conducting heat for cooking. The food comes out beautifully. I love that nothing sticks. It is breeze to clean up the pan. I like the soft touch handle that does not get hot. I am glad it has the helper handle which is needed with a pan this size. The helper handle, though, gets hot so be careful. I was surprised that this pan cannot be put in the oven. I find that disappointing. The directions that come with the pan are printed on a small card attached to the handle in extremely small print. It is very hard to read (I had to take off my glasses and hold the card near my nose to read it—there was squinting involved as well). I wish I had a magnifying glass on hand. I like this versatile pan. I can boil, saute, fry, deep fry, flambe, stew, and poach in this pan. I like how deep it is (helps keep the stove top clean when frying). If this pan was oven safe, it would be perfect. This pan does an excellent job."

"They don't lie. This is a truly versatile pan. I have used it for searing, sautéing, and boiling, and it is really handy to be able to do it all in one pan. For instance, I seared the meat for quesadillas, then wiped out the pan and used it to grill the filled tortillas. I also used it to boil some potatoes, then used the chopped potatoes in the same pan in an egg hash with the leftover quesadilla meat from the night before! Brilliant.  I love that the sides are so high. It allows for the fun ""shake to stir"" technique without too much risk of spillage. The handle mostly stays cool, although of course be careful of that. It is dishwasher safe but so nonstick I have just been wiping it out in the sink.  Another clever feature is that the handle can act as a built-in utensil rest. The included wooden spoon fits perfectly. I tested it on some of my own utensils, and it was hit and miss, but it worked well with my smaller rubber spatulas and flippers. This of course saves on clean up.  I had my 22-year-old also test this and gives it a strong two thumbs up. Bon Appetite!"
"There’s a really popular, expensive pan similar to this that I’ve wanted but the price is a lot higher than this one so I haven’t bought it. I love the style of this pan and the gorgeous color. But, I especially like the way this works! It washes easily, even after I cooked the sausage. It comes with a lid and a wood spatula/turner.  This pan is multipurpose and is made to replace: fry pan, sauté pan, saucepan, stockpot, non-stick pan, wok, skillet and braiser. It’s very well made. It’s a good weight, not too heavy or light. I have just stores it on my stovetop because I love the look of it.  It’s nonstick but make sure to read the tag that comes on it. It has instructions about the best uses and care. My only issue is the card is small so it’s hard to read. But I believe it stayed to start out heating it on low heat. You’ll just want to make sure to take care of it so it lasts. I feel like the pan will be durable but I’m not sure about the turner."
"Great for frying, stir frying, braising, sautéing, big enough to use as a Dutch oven and deep enough to use for soup. Nothing sticks to it. The heavier weight metal delivers consistent heat. Knobs on the interior of the lid work well to drip down flavor when making stews or braising."
"First of all, this pan is gorgeous and I basically want to keep it out on my stovetop all the time just to show off the pretty lilac color. But even better than that, it's so easy to cook on... And it's SO easy to clean. You don't need a lot of oil when you cook in this pan since it's incredibly non-stick. That also makes everything super easy to clean our of it. Cleaning literally takes seconds. The pan is super lightweight, which is nice for the most part, though it does make it feel a little less high-quality. That said, it also costs less than similar pans from similar brands.  I do recommend using this pan over low or medium heat and don't think it's great for high heat. If you want to sear a steak or something like that, I recommend cast iron instead. Overall, this is an awesome pan to add to my collection. The size is perfect as there's so much that can be done with it! I love the wooden spoon it comes with, too!"
"This is yet another inexpensive dupe for the Our Place Always Pan. While it's hardly a bargain basement price, it's still about 50% less than the original. If you've been curious to try the Always Pan, this is a great alternative. Honestly, I love this thing so much, I can't imagine the original could be any better.  Believe the hype.  This is non-stick (without the questionable Teflon coating), extremely lightweight (even though it looks like a cast iron La Creuset), super easy to clean and attractive. While it isn't really deep enough for soups and stews (like the Always Pan ads suggest), it's become my new go-to sauce pan for just about all my cooking needs from searing to sauteeing to pan frying. Plus it comes in a gorgeous selection of colors. I ordered a fire-engine red one for me and a pale blue one for my mother."
"First impressions: Much bigger in size than expected! Takes a lot of room. Heavy build, good solid construction.  I have used this multiple times now for different things and I'm pretty happy with its performance. It has a nice even distribution and no hot spots noticed. It cooks evenly and cleans very very easily. I do not have to use any force to clean, just detergent and warm water cleans it to perfection.  However I would like to know more about its build. Because at the end of the day this thing is totally Aluminum. There's no ceramic coating or anything like that. It does say its free of toxic materials and I'll take their word for it. But they also say its free of nanoparticles...but nanoparticles of what? Nobody knows. I feel like for a pan with a heavy price tag I hope it really is free of the nasties!"
This is a quality pan. The nonstick coating is excellent and makes cooking a breeze. I used it to saute green beans and smoked sausage and it worked great for that. It was easy to clean with soap and warm water. The price is economical and I love the color/finish.
"Goodful All-In-One Pan  11-Inch, 4.4-Quart Capacity, Blue Mist  The trend of all-in-one pans has become the latest trend in cookware. The Goodful All-In-One Pan replaces many pans in one pan such as a frying pan and a saute pan. The pan is lighter than using cast iron since it is made from cast aluminum.  It comes in an array of colors so you can pick your favorite color. I have blue in my home so I ordered the blue mist. The blue shade is okay in my opinion. It’s a little plain and 80s country blue instead of a newer shade like an aqua but it is still pretty.  The pan works great for almost any task that you can use it for. If it fits then this pan will cook it.  ⛵⚓Seas the Day⚓⛵"
"This is actually a fantastic all-in-one pan and exactly what I was looking for! Ever since I got an air fryer I admittedly do not use my stove as much as I used to, therefore I've been looking for a good all-in-one stovetop pan to free up some space.  I was pleasantly surprised with how non-stick this actually is! I made spaghetti sauce in it for my first meal and couldn't believe how everything rinsed right off when I was finished (and with no staining!). I also like how lightweight it is and how the handle doesn't seem to get hot while cooking.  Net-net, it's a great, sturdy pan and looks great too! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced all-in-one."

"This is my new Favourite pan. The color is gorgeous, nothing sticks, and it’s sooo easy to clean up. It’s a perfect size, on the larger end, but it’s seriously everything you need and worth the cost."
"This is a nice sized pan that could replace a very heavy cast iron Dutch oven or stir-fry wok, among other things, as it comes with a nice deep bottom and a heavy lid. It is not cast iron, but ""cast"" aluminum (whatever that is), and the food really truly does not stick. The pan also comes with a wooden spatula that will never mar the pan's non-stick finish.  It does not seem to be enameled, I'm not sure what the top layer coating on this piece is, but it is much lighter than cast iron, and much heavier than your average aluminum pan.  Nice color, too.  Two drawbacks: it is costly, and it is made in China."
"I've been wanting to downsize and get rid of my myriad mismatched frying pans and saucepans. I've fried eggs, made mac'n'cheese and chili in this pan so far. It works great for everything. It's big enough to hold a full batch of Bear Creek's Darn Good Chili, but still light enough that I don't feel like I'm always about to drop it. It's extremely easy to clean with a sponge.  The lid does fit tightly, so you can't use it to drain the water off pasta. It takes up the whole large burner on my stovetop and it seems to distribute the heat evenly. I haven't had an issue with the handle getting hot during use."
This has to be one of the best things I have cooked in
"This is probably the nicest piece of cookware I own. The color is so pretty, it heats up evenly, it's the perfect size, and it's easy to clean. The quality is excellent. Although it is dishwasher safe, I think it will last longer if you hand wash thoroughly, but so far it cleans up easily because of the non-stick surface. It is also recommended to use a lower heat setting, so because of this, it takes a bit longer to cook the food. Everything I've cooked in this has come out excellent though despite the longer cook time. I'm very pleased with this pan."
"This might be one of my favorite pot-pan I have in the kitchen. I love my cast iron but it’s heavy. This one is light and can do so many things. For my household this is the perfect size for any dish I make. I cook a lot of dishes with sauces, ingredients, braising etc. and …nothing sticks, heat distribution is on point, everything fits, cooks evenly. It has a good sturdy handle that does not get hot. I love the color! The only thing that may be different is that I couldn’t find info if I could put this in the oven. Either way, I still love it."
"Nothing sticks to this pan and it wipes clean or washes in seconds and the heat is nice and even. I use the wooden spoon that came with the pan to avoid scratching the nonstick surface. The color is beautiful. I cooked a Spanish rice dish (see photo) entirely in this pan and it worked so much better than my stainless steel pans. I had to cook onions, without oil, for five minutes and had no sticking/burning. The rice cooked up perfectly, too. This will be my ""go to"" pan without hesitation! I wish I could give more than 5 stars; highly recommend!"
"The design of the pan is so cute! Aside from it's good quality, it is also perfect for different kinds of food to cook. I am very satisfied."
I desperately needed a new pan and I am SO happy with this one. This really is an all you need pan (with the exception of not being oven safe). My old pan did not evenly cook and everything stuck to it and it was difficult to clean. This pan is extremely non stick and easy to clean. It heats up quickly and food cooks evenly in it. It is a great size for larger meals or to use as a pot. I also love that it comes in a few different colors. I highly recommend this pan. It is very durable and will be a keeper for a long time.
"This is an impressive piece of cookware. It is an extremely versatile pan. You can fry in it, you can simmer in it, you can sauté in it, and it holds a lot because it’s pretty good size.  I love the color that I got it looks just like the photos. I have to say that this is most definitely worth the price. It’s very easy to wash you can choose to put it in your dishwasher or easily hand wash it.  This pan is a must have for your kitchen.  I hope this review as helpful."
"This pan is generously sized and very good looking. It's a beautiful color. It has a well-fitting lid and the straight sides traditional for a saute pan. It's big enough for fryiong chicken, for a fricasee, or a one-pan skillet dinner.  It's surprisingly lightweight, but feels sturdy and solidly made. It heats quickly and evenly. The nonstick coating is very effective.  I'm amazed that it can go in the dishwasher -- that's a real plus! It comes with a wooden spatula which should be hand washed."
Very nice pan with nonstick coating. I love the red color and that it is a really great size for multiple different meals. It is a little heavier than other pans I have and the top is a metal that is really loud when moved or placed down. My one dislike is that the smaller handle on the side is not heat proof. It will get really hot and my previous pans were not like this so I've almost burned my hand a few times. Overall a good pan that I hope the nonstick will continue to work for a good amount of time.
"This pan is so pretty and I love the lilac color. It's very well constructed and a good size to be used for many purposes. It's also not that heavy despite how big it looks so it can be lifted easily even by elders. The only problem is that is the pan is so pretty that my mom now wraps it up and put it away because she does not want to make the bottom dirty from cooking. Maybe one day I'll finally be able to convince her to bring it out to use it for now, it's a pretty pan to look at."
"This is a very efficient and functional pan. It's not only very nice looking, the quality is excellent. Truly non-stick it has cooked up pasta sauce beautifully and it has a nice deep design which allows me to put the pasta directly in the sauce without any problems. The handle is soft and does not get hot while cooking. Comes with a lid and a very nice wooden spoon. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone. This is now my go to pan in the house. Love the way it cooks my food!"
"So far I’ve made fried rice, eggs, one pot pasta, and cooked chicken and sausage in this pan. Not a single bit has stuck even though I like to take minimal oil while cooking! Also cleaning the pot has been super easy, both because nothing has stuck to it in the first place, and because the pan is pretty lightweight. I like the fun colors and have been enjoying this pan. It doesn’t feel top quality like the few Staub pieces I have, but for the price it seems like a good value!"

"When I saw this Goodful All-in-One Pan, I was immediately reminded of the Always Pan although there are some differences in design. The terracotta exterior finish looks beautiful on the stovetop; unfortunately, there are a few spots on the lid edges where the coating is missing.  Cast aluminum is lighter than cast iron and multi-ply stainless steel so this pan is not as heavy as some of my other cookware and would be suitable for those with weaker wrists. The lid has dots inside, which allow condensed water to drip back into the pan. As for the durable nonstick claims, I have had other ceramic finish pots that eventually started sticking so I will have to wait and see how long the non-stick lasts."
"Multipurpose pans are similar to asian woks when it comes to the versatility of cooking methods. You can stir fry, steam, slow cook, deep oil frying, or boiling a large pot of soup, it can do it all. My primary purpose of using this pan is to make stir fry and slow cooking certain stew type proteins and vegetables. It's actually quite good when it comes to stir frying because of how fast it heats up, and how the heat is evenly distributed."
"I was surprised by the lightness of this pan! It looks like it's going to be heavy like cast iron, but it is very light. It is smaller than the large skillet I normally use but it is deeper so it appears to hold about the same amount. It browned my ground beef better than my skillet normally does, and there was no problem with sticking. I love the color, and also the wooden spatula that came with it. I expect this to be my new go-to pan."

Well made pan. Makes a nice gift. Great non stock surface. Seems very durable.
"This is a large, attractive pan with a tight fitting lid that worked perfectly to produce a pan of chicken with rice. Some things to consider about this pan, the instructions that came with the pan were so small, that I needed a magnifying glass to read them. The pan is not oven safe, stovetop only and should not be used with metal utensils. The pan should be lightly oiled to maintain the non stick surface. The pan can be used on gas,electric, glass top, and induction surfaces. When you need a pan to prepare a large quantity of food this may Be the pan to scramble a dozen or more eggs"
"This pan is worth the price. The nonstick coating works well and is easy to clean with a warm soapy sponge. The finish is great and I like that the handle does not get hot. I used it to make eggs that turned out well. It is not too heavy, but is solid enough to cook anything. It can be used for stir fry, fried rice, and any other saute recipe. I love the color and quality of this pan."

"This all-in-one pan is great if you don't cook much or don't have much room to store a bunch of cookware. It works well and cleans up fine in the dishwasher. I don't cook anything fancy and this pan works for me. I love the red color. It looks nice on my cooktop. It fits in my kitchen cabinets, which is where I store it when not in use."
"This is a very unique color for pans. I get tired of the black or red that you usually see. This is very pretty. It's very practical, too. You can do all that it says. The handle is strong and the weight is easy to hold. You can lift to shake or flip good easily. It's super easy to clean. For the money, this is a great value."
"We like to make tuna steaks and pork chops Fra diavalo in our frying pan, but it was too shallow and splattered everywhere. This is a much deeper pan (with a cover) and helps contain the splatter. It’s non stick and makes cleanup easy. I wish I had gotten this pan months ago , it would have saved me from cleaning up the spatter"
This is stylish and a useful multipurpose pan. This All-In-One Pan can sizzle and fry multiple dishes. I like the Nonstick pan. The Cast Construction seems well made. I like that it is Dishwasher Safe but I still prefer to hand wash it. *Thanks for reading my review & hope it helps make your decision easier*
"I got this as a gift for my sister, it seems like a very nice pan and will be useful for so many things due to its size. Haven’t gifted it yet so I’m not sure how well it is with being non stick but I’ll report back. The quality and size of it is great. I also love the blue."
"This pan is all you ever need in the kitchen! It's beautiful and multi-purpose. You can make everything in this pan, from chicken to pasta, it's worth the cost and comes in so many pretty colors!"
The pan is deep and holds lots of food. Lightweight and easy to clean. Cooked a marinara dish to see how it handles the red sauce and clean up was not problem. It did not stain or change colors.
"This is an excellent skillet - it looks heavy however, it is not at all. Washes very well and has a lid that fits perfect and comes with an wooden spatula. Very well made and an excellent price"
"Lightweight, delicate and beautiful, very high-end. It can be used as both a work and a frying pan. It has a good non-stick effect. If there are not many people, it is enough to have this one."
The BEST pan. I use it several times a day. Cleans wonderfully. Truly nonstick. Heats up fast and even cooking. I absolutely love this pan it’s all I’ve been using.
This is an awesome pan. Great size. Very sturdy but lightweight. Easy to clean. The included spatula is very nice. It cooks evenly. The color is beautiful!
It’s so pretty I don’t even want to use it! The color is exactly what I was wanting. Very deep so that I can deep fry
"Look: These things work fine for what they are. Treat them properly and they will last you a few years as very non-stick then repurpose them for another few years as slightly less non-stick. NO non-stick pan will remain so forever. And if you want something a bit higher in quality, SPEND MORE MONEY. This is a freaking $15 pan, not a $90 Tfal or whatever. As for the negative reviews, you can tell by looking at their pictures that they have been abusing their pans, which is why they failed. If you have blackened food up the sides of the pan, you're abusing it. NEVER turn this thing up high and why would you? If you want to sear something, use a stainless steel or cast iron pan, NOT a skillet designed to fry an egg in.  When these ceramic pans go ""bad"" at least they don't shed cancer causing material like the old teflon pans did. Treat them gently and they do the job. I never even use soap on mine, I simply wipe it out with a towel while it's still warm and hang it on its hook. Done. NEVER put in the dishwasher. NEVER use a scrubby.  Sorry for the tone of the review but I don't tolerate people who bash on products that THEY ABUSED."
"I love, Love, LOVE these pans! I have multiple. Nothing sticks! They are a bit sensitive but as long as you dont scratch the coating or put them in the dishwasher they last years. I have bought 5 of various sizes and only 2 have died. 1 I was running through the dishwasher regularly so it only lasted a year or so. The second my husband accidentally turned on the wrong burner and burnt the empty pan. So aside from human mishaps they are great pans. Have and will continue to buy again!"
"I've been using this pan several times a week for over 7 months, and I've had no problems with it. I mostly cook scrambled eggs with added cheese and veggies, make tuna melts and other cheese sandwiches, heat refried beans, reheat leftover Chinese takeout, pasta, and other restaurant food... Plenty of opportunities for food to stick and burn, but I've never had this happen. You do need to keep the heat LOW and stir often. The pan cleans up instantly when hand-washed. Despite my imprudently stirring the heating food with a fork from time to time, I have no nicks in the finish, either. Treat the pan with reasonable care and it will do a beautiful job!  Update on 6/14/2021: I have had the pan for almost a year now and use it several times a week on the variety of foods I mentioned, and it's still in perfect shape. I bought another, larger one and it's proving to be of the same quality."
"I was gifted this pan a year ago and it was my absolute favorite small nonstick pan. Food slid out and clean up was so easy, you could pretty much just wipe it out. It was always hand washed and never put in the dishwasher. Then my husband burned butter in it while frying an egg. No matter how much soaking and dawn and scrubbing with the non-scratch sponge I did I couldn’t get it clean. So I used Bar Keepers Friend. It got the pan sparkling clean - and ruined the non-stick finish (not visible to the eye). The next time the pan was used was for scrambled eggs and It was a disaster. Clean up was a nightmare. The eggs would barely scrub off. Thought maybe it was a fluke and used it again to cook scrambled eggs. And again it was a headache to clean. I ended up just throwing it in the garbage. So, I bought a new pan and now know to warn my husband not to scorch butter and not to use Bar Keepers Friend to clean it. I did purchase the green pan renewal sponges to use if I ever have a tough clean up again (the sponges were sadly not able to revive the ruined pan). Just beware what you use to clean it if it’s anything other than Dawn."
"Unfortunately I just started using this pan...which I thought was adorable and matched my aqua kitchen... unfortunately I need to throw it out...because it is past the window to return it... The pan is NOT non-stick...as you can see by the picture, even though I followed the instructions... it sticks to everything... I feel like either I got a faulty pan, or it is just not a good pan."
"I didn't rate the durability because I just got this pan, but the non-stick surface works great (I always cook my eggs in butter or ghee butter) and I bought this smaller diameter pan because my 8 inch pan was a little too big for just two eggs. I especially chose this pan in order to make pairs of sunny side up eggs or eggs over medium. It's the perfect size for two eggs at a time, but I still use my 8 inch GreenPan ""Magneto"" for omelettes with lots of veggies because I need a little extra room. An important plus with both pans is that they don't have bolt-heads inside the bowl of the pan where the handle attaches. This makes them easier to clean because there are no obstructions inside the pan to allow a build up of gunk."
"I am delighted to find a non-stick pan with no dangerous chemicals. This pan is sturdy, attractive and easy to clean. I have been using it daily since it arrived. I have gotten rid of all my old skillets because this one is so much of an improvement. I plan to buy more in other sizes to restock my kitchen."
"Okay, I've had this for less than a day but felt compelled to write this brief review.  1. Weight: It was delivered in a package with another item and when I picked the box up I thought the pan wasn't included because the box was so light. Turns out it was; it's just super-lightweight. 2. Non-stick: I read and followed the instructions, particularly ""don't use cooking spray"" (I used butter and olive oil) and don't use high heat (I didn't exceed ""4"" on the stovetop).  I cooked a one-egg omelet with cheese and sauted tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions. Never have I had a pan that is as non-stick as this one. Super easy to flip the omelet and slide it out onto the plate.  Highly recommend. May update this later after additional use. For now, blown away."
"Edit: I’ve used this pan almost every morning to cook eggs and it is still in pristine condition. If you take good care of it and follow care instructions, this is a super great pan. Photos are after 20+ times using the pan.  I’m really impressed with this pan! It’s the perfect size for cooking eggs (easily fits 2) or really any other food that requires low/medium heat. Given, I haven’t used this pan many times yet, it seems solid. I’ll edit my review if things change, but I assume that if I follow the detailed care instructions that came with the pan, I’ll have a great and stylish kitchen tool for many years to come."
"First just let me say...Ya got to know how to measure a frying pan, LOL (which I did not). That being said...this skillet is a GOOD product. It's EASY to clean, I cook WITHOUT oil or sprays and NOTHING has stuck or burned yet. It is A LOT SMALLER than I thought, But is a TRUE 7 INCHES. Yes I would recommend this product ...just make sure ya know HOW to measure a frying pan, LOL."
"This is my third small green pan. It’s perfect for 2 scrambled eggs, HOWEVER, keep the heat low. I have a gas stove and I keep it at 4 or below. I use a tiny bit of butter more for flavor then I wipe it out with paper towels when I’m done. I mistakenly burned my first one. Live and learn!"
"Cute. Feels light at first, but that is because it is balanced. Used this to replace a handle-heavy pan that wouldn’t sit on the burner right. Heat distributes evenly, even with my cursed electric range. Super non stick and easy to clean. Burnt cheese (my cooking skills could probably use a bit of work) is no problem - it just slides right off. Remember not to use metal utensils and this pan will last along time."
"Eggs and other things slide right out after cooking, without any fat added to the pan. Can even make a toasted cheese or other sandwich in it without greasing it. Rinses out easily. Hopefully it doesn’t loose its nonstick surface, as most other coated pans do. It’s pretty too. I enjoy using it."
"I love everything about this series of pans. It is important, however, for LONGTERM durability and continued safe/cooking ease, to follow their suggestions for using MEDIUM heat mostly and rinsing/washing with warm soapy water after cooking. Subtext - don't leave it sitting on a burner or in sink with food residue for overnight."
"Never thought I'd write a review for a pan, but it's perfect! Most of them are too big when you only want to cook an egg or two. This one is the perfect size, plus the non-stick surface is wonderfully slick. It heats up quickly and evenly, and it's easy to clean. Cute too! My new favorite pan."
I’ve never bought a ceramic finished pan b4 but wanted to try one because it’s safer to use than standard non-stick pans. I am not disappointed. Eggs slide right out of the pan after cooking without using a utensil to kind of help it along as I had to use with the standard non-stick pan. Nice slick finish easy to cook and remove your food? What more can I ask for. Great pan!
Just the right size for a simple omelette for one. I use a little olive oil in my pan cook over low for a nice fluffy omelette. Eggs do not stick. Easy to clean up. My college son will be receiving one for his house soon. Hand wash to maintain the finish. Don't use Pam type sprays to maintain the pan.
Great everday pan and cleans up easily. There are no bolt heads on the inside of the pan to collect food that’s hard to remove. Genius. Been using nearly daily for months and looks good. About half and half hand wash and dishwasher.
I needed a small non-stick pan for omelettes and making things like one grilled cheese sandwich. The ceramic pan world has been a blessing to those of us who cook a lot. This little pan has already earned its keep in our home. And the color makes it easy to find in the cabinet. Well worth the money. Highly recommend.
"This is a GREAT little pan. Greenpans are the best!!! This one is small... two eggs, scrambled, one grilled cheese... not a family sized pan. But works for what i need in my rv. I love it!!!! CLEANS UP LIKE A DREAM!!!!!"
"I got this 7 inch pan because I wanted a pan specifically for cooking eggs. I've had this for a couple of weeks and have used it everyday. Granted I've only cooked eggs in it. It heats up great. Perfect size for two eggs. A little small for omelets but does work if you're not overloading the eggs. Cleanup is easy, just wipe it out with a paper towel."
This frying pan is perfect in every way! NOTHING sticks to it! And it's so easy to clean. I bought the smallest one for eggs but I'm going to buy the larger ones as well. Only wish it had a lid.
"I absolutely love these pans, I cook everyday and these pans hold up to that kind of work. I do not use any kind of metal utensil on these pans as it will scratch the coating."
"I am WoW’d by this skillet !! I admit, I am a culinary snob. I possess the top of the line set. This skillet blows them out of the water. I just bought it for the size for scrambled eggs. The ease , the even cooking , clean-up and the price, has put this little gem, as my fav! Considering the others, in the product line."
"Everyday use. Have purchased many skillets/pans in my day, but this is the best pan ever. So easy to clean, wish I would have come across these pans years ago. Have also a 10"" ceramic pan just like this one. It too is best ever."
I love my new GreenPan! I’ve only had it a short time but what I’ve cooked in it did not stick and cooked evenly. I would recommend this pan!
My 78 year old father was using a pan from 1960. I’m not lying. His old pan had absolutely no more “non stick” on it. I pulled up some pans on Amazon and he chose this one. He liked the color. He says it great! It’s nice to bring some happiness into his life via a pan.
"I have only used it once so I will see how it goes. I love the look and color. Blend nicely with some of my ""thing"" on the counter like my bread box and spatula."
"Solid little egg slayer. You can't really flip the egg for an egg over easy because the sides are too steep (note to pan makers, make low round edge pans to flip eggs) but you can do a hack on the eggs to achieve an egg over easy with out flipping.  Good to warm ham, turkey, or roast beef for a sandwich.  Not good for conking burglars. Too light."
"I’m loving this little pan! I use it for fried eggs, sautéing veggies, etc. it’s cleans up easy and snuggles between pots or lids. A keeper!"
Perfect size for small breakfast one or two people great for eggs easy to clean no stick great product great price
"I would add that you should not store anything inside the pan. The pan is small, so I have no reason to stack another pan inside it. Works great!"
This is a Christmas present for him since his old pan is shot. He uses a pan this size every moning to fry his 4 eggs! I will let you know how he likes this new pan! 😏
Just great for eggs any time because it just wipes out. Not a heavy pan and love the color.
Perfect for morning breakfast of scrambled eggs. Nothing sticks. I use a wooden spurtle spatula. Hand washing is recommended.
"We got this to replace a little skillet that had seen its better days. This pan is awesome. Works well, cooks evenly and is a snap to clean. We will have this one for years!"
Perfect for a burger are a 2 egg omelette. Easy to clean and pleasant to look at. Don't know about your ability as I've only had it a week
This size is great for cooking about 4 eggs. It’s light weight and easy to clean. The only downfall is it recommends hand washing only.
"I love this pan, and so does my 7yo. it's sturdy, nonstick, and super easy to clean. just the right size for an omelette, and cute enough that the kiddo wants to learn to cook her own omelettes now"
Works great! It fits a couple eggs or has enough space for one grilled cheese sandwich. Easy to clean
"Nothing every burns (which is slightly annoying when you actually want to sear something or prepare a bit overdone), very easy to clean, overall pretty amazing."
Small enough for eggs or a pancake. Lightweight! Cleans easy!
"easy to handle, easy to clean perfect for a quick breakfast"
"I didn't believe this pan was so easy to cook in and clean, too. But it is! That's why I kept putting off buying it. Then in a moment of weakness, I did order it, and boy, am I glad I did!"
This pan is the perfect size for one burger or one egg.
"This pan is Simply Amazing. It truly is non-stick and easy to clean. Cook's food evenly. And I can rest assured that my family is safe from toxic chemicals and materials. Will be looking to see if they sell other sizes, would love to create a set."
Bought this pan to enable me to easily flip my eggs-over-easy. It does the job well. Has a nice weight to the pan. Love it.
great for eggs - or a sauce ... cleans with a wipe
Last year I ordered Green pans as well as some cheaper ceramic pans. The others did not hold up nearly as well as this one some more from you.
I like ceramic pans for eggs as I do eat a lot of them. I generally limit my choice of pans for breakfast to either ceramic or diamond so these work great for me.
"I have gone through many of them. I do use a tiny fit of oil, and it works great, soooooo easy to clean up."
"Easy to clean, great color. I can use lower heat with great results. Love the environmental impact and no noxious gases! Beautiful colors, too!"
Pan is great if you cook on low to medium heat with olive oil sprayed in pan. This will make the pan non-stick. DO NOT try to cook on HIGH heat as it will ruin the pan.
I used this small pan for a single omelet and it was perfect. Perfect size and just the right amount of heat distribution.
Nice pan. Nothing sticks. I hope it lasts.
This pan is just what I was looking for!
"Love it. Fries eggs like a dream and all slides out. Cleans easy. The colour is so very pretty. Now looking to buy an 8"" one."
"This pan is attractive and colorful, also does not stick and cleans easily. I love it."
i really like this pan. i have had no issues with it and have been using for 2 weeks. I would recommend! It cleans easy and has great non stick surface.
These are the easiest to clean pots and pans we have ever use. My parents used to eat out every meal until the pandemic came along. My mom is getting to be such a master cook with these pans.
Great pan. Ceramic surface has no rivets making it easy to clean. Also has a very comfortable handle.
I liked it and it’s east to clean
We just got it and used it for the first time and it worked great. Glad I ordered it.
This pan has been. Even burned on cheese came right off. And I love the color. Definitely worth the money.
This is a five star scillet!
"We have the smallest size of this pan. It is nicely made, distributes heat well, and is very nonstick if you use a bit of butter or oil."
The size is perfect for many of the small amounts I cook. Excellent for eggs and especially omelettes. It is easy to clean and very pretty.
I learned it cooks best on lower heat. I’ve burned my previous pans. Nonstick healthy surface is a plus.
Bought pan for daughter ! She loved it and it worked well !
Perfect little fry pan for a couple of eggs or grilled cheese 🧀 ect.
"I missed my mom’s Asian cuisines and I was never able to make one by myself. Wfh really push me to get in the kitchen and start picking up on cooking. Most cooking pans I have are too heavy and shallow for food tossing while frying. This wok seems to be designed for that. It is light weight and have a half sphere shape bowl for me to toss and catch while frying, which made me look professional, and somehow I feel my cooking can taste like my mom’s. I also like the stainless steel utensils included in the kit. They are of very good quality."
""
What an amazing set. Sturdy and durable made of Carbon steel so no pieces will end up in your food. Highly recommend gonna be amazing for stir frys.
"I've been cooking with this almost daily since I bought it over a month ago. It works extremely well for me and cleaning it is simple and quick. This wok is thin enough that you can get a super high heat easily. I use peanut oil and put the gas up to ""high"" and keep the food moving around the wok to prevent any burning. About 4 minutes and everything is cooked through and ready to eat. So far so good. The included utensils are perfectly fine with this wok though there are better options out there. For the price it is great they even included the utensils at all. I recommend a bamboo steaming basket asap to go with this."
"I had been looking for these kind of woks for so long and then I finally came across this one. At first I thought it might not be very strong for the price. However, after using it for almost a week, I can say that this wok is literally the one like the chefs use. I would recommend seasoning the wok after every use to avoid any kind of black residue coming out."
"Being a total new to wok cooking, I researched for months and yes there are better ones, but for the price this one is outstanding, follow the seasoning directions and it is a snap to clean. It cooks evenly and the lid is a wonderful addition I would buy this again"
smaller then i thought but like the utensils that came with it. really like the lid. i wouldnt put it in the dishwasher and like all woks it seems like it scratches some when you clean the bottom inside. overall i give it a B+. still searching for that A+
"I love, love, love this wok. I have cooked Brussels sprouts, chicken with vegetables and whole mushrooms and each and every time they have come out perfectly. The Brussels sprouts appear to have been roasted. Cooking with the wok also shortens cooking time."
"Very impressed with this wok, so much so that we stopped using most of my cooking pans. Practical in every aspect. The wooden lid and metal utensil truly complete this product. Highly recommended!"
"So easy to cook with, I’m really loving this Wok. I’m eating pescatarian for health reasons and this is helping with the cooking. Everyone is loving the food cooked in it."
It is just a lightweight cheap aluminum wok. Returned it without using it but it probably works fine just won’t last long. The hammer marks are fake if its not obvious in the pics already
"I watch the video on how to season the wok. I did exactly what the video said to do and I used it for the first time tonight to make pepper steak and onions. Soon as I threw the meat into the pan it was Wham! Bam thank you ma’am all my meat stuck to the pan. I was so upset because of course it affected the flavor up my food. The thing is it only stuck to the very bottom of the pan I moved it around to the sides and it slid right off. I have no idea why it stuck to the bottom because I rub that oil all over that pan, Rinse it with hot water, dried it with a paper towel, heated it up again, added more oil, rub the oil all over it, wiped off the excess oil and I let it sit for 24 hours. Like I said I heated up Added my oil added my meat and everything stuck to it"
The lid is too small for the pan. The lid is also fragile and seems like it will break easily.
"We are very happy with this product. The lid looks cool but not that practical. That the only downside. We do enjoy the wok quiet a bit. We use it all the time. It has really helped us it healthier meals for nutrition and weight loss. We also use it to fry eggs, to make spaghetti sauce and pancakes to name just a few. It really is a good product for the price. The extra tools make it even better. It cleans easy."
Burned the pan first use. Value was good can't say seasoning it would help as the husband just fried things with no oil and ruined it. Will update as soon as replacement arrives
"I bought this pan because on the review it’s good for frying and sautéing, I followed the instructions how to seasoned the pan and after 24 hrs soaked in oil and washed it leave a like kinda metal yellowish stain in it, haven’t even a chance to use it. 😡"
"We thought this would be a good wok but after receiving it we realized that it was super thin and easy to bend out of shape. We loved all of the items that came with it l, especially the wooden lid but the top didn’t really fit appropriately. Cooks ok for now but we could tell that it won’t last long."
"I love this skillet! I have made many meals in here so far! The only reason why I’m giving it a 4 star is because by the 2nd use I noticed some rust on the inside. I cleaned with vinegar and it came off but ever since then, i have to pre season it with a little bit of olive oil after I use and clean it."
"After about 1.5 weeks of usage the black coating chipped off completely in the center and the wok has become ultra rust prone. Complete waste of money. Trust me, do not buy."
"It's a rust bucket like many say but in addition, there's some type of black coating that keeps coming off with the food and has a bad taste, especially noticeable with white rice noodles. One star is too generous"
"It works, and that's great, but it rusts on a dime! It's supposedly not cast iron, but it acts exactly like it...DO NOT put this in the dishwasher!! Treat it like a cast iron pan."
"Wish I had read the reviews before buying. Rusts extremely easy. Ie. Boil water, and it rusts. Sautee vegetables (because water) it will rust. After cleaning and drying, dont forget to add oil or it will rust."
We got this item and followed all the directions. We seasoned it and never put it in the dishwasher. We used it a couple of times and it was hard to clean. It’s not a non stick pan so everything burns to the bottom if you don’t keep stirring. After taking awhile to clean not using anything abrasive we seasoned it and it still rusted. It didn’t even last a month. The positive is the utensils it came with. Those held up better then the wok. If you’re looking for a long lasting durable wok look elsewhere.
"The pan is very pretty, but even after following instructions on how to ""season"" the pan the first use resulted in the rice sticking. I washed as instructed and the pan already shows signs of rust. The lid is also useless as the heat causes the wood to swell and lose the proper shape. Would not recommend."
The handle was impossible to attach. The lid didn’t fit well. I returned it.
"Threw away after two tries. Everything sticks, doesn’t clean well at all. Junk"
It's ok. I should have purchased a bigger wok and more durable. Cheaply made.
Food would stick and is not supposed to.
"Cheaply made item that does not work, I was excited about this item but after a few uses it wore down very quickly."
I used just ones. And the paint come up Not durability at all.
"The wok came with the handle detached. You can not put it on, as its broken."
"I’m just not satisfied, I can’t cook right it gets sticky"
Very poor cheap product. I used it twice and The metal was rusted. I don’t recommend it.
I used this product for my regular cooking for noodles such as “pancit”. I’ve always loved Wok until I ordered and used this. After my second use I started noticing the bottom part of the wok were easily getting corroded. The black paint was coming off and rust was showing. I haven’t used it ever since.
"To anyone concerned about rusting after seeing the pictures, I guarantee they weren't cleaned properly. Carbon steel needs to be treated more like cast iron. There are tips above, but if you don't know how to care for it, there are several sites you can Google to get some detailed instructions."
Absolutely love this wok! Very good quality and the style is awesome. So much better than one I bought from Walmart . Very satisfied and impressed with this purchase.
Great product for the price! Loved the light weight and all the extra accessories!
How big it is
Love it. Easy to clean and use
So I bought this awhile ago and just got around to using it. It came without the bolt to hold the handle in place. Husband has been to several hardware stores but can't seem to find the correct size. It's now too late to return this item. Everything else is great about the wok just upset that the handle won't stay on. I have attached a pic.
Video Player is loading.
Very bad quality
"I returned this. All the food burnt on the bottom, even thought I stirred it all the time. Half the utensils I would never use. Was disappointed ."
"I like how the wok is made, nonstick and honeycomb grooved with no chemicals. The inclusion of a lid and accessories is a big plus and value for your money."
Had to assemble handle (easy peasy). So far it's great!
Great product
Very poor quality. The bottom of the pot is yellow the first time I use it. I can't wash it off. I can't fry things at all. The bottom is rusty
It horrible! I only used my wok 3 times and it rusted!
No directions on how to attach handle. ☺️
"I had a problem with my wok initially, but customer service was very responsive in helping to resolve the issue."

My husband destroyed my daughters wok with metal utensils and bacon. I bought her this and she loves it. The lid is perfectttttt.
"I started to look for a Chinese wok couple weeks ago in Amazon, but I couldn't find any wok is cheaper than this. This wok can also be used on the electric stove and the thermal conductivity is very good! So I highly recommand."
Love this wok. Also like that ut came with a lid and tools for cooking.
The wok looks good. I can hold it with one hand. But the lid looks not of good quality.
"When I asked my daughter what she wanted for dinner, she said sesame chicken.... so I immediately started looking for a Wok as I knew this would work best for the dish. I found this one on Amazon and was able to get it in a few hours. I not only used it to fry up the chicken, but made the sauce and noodles in it as well! The accessories were a great add here and used several of them which does not affect the pan and are also lightweight! Important to note, this pan get hot very fast and can lead to smoking... need to ensure the heat you use is appropriate and not set too high as to burn your food. I can't wait to use this pan again for other things... Would definitely recommend!"
"Great for quick cooking, easy to wash, and very very light. I love the utensils that come with it but am a little afraid to use the spatula like one because of the edges. Hopefully the edges won’t scratch up the wok! The handle was relatively use to out together although I had to work a bit to line up the holes correctly. But I really can’t complain. Great product for the price."
"I am so surprised,the wok is better than I expected,looks like expensive ones.and so many gifts are good quality than expected too."
Love love love
"Finally a wok pan that I can toss ca little bit. All my other pans are so heavy and have a flat bottom, I can barely hold them with one hand. But this one works like wonder! Plus i really needed all this Chinese spatulas Lolol This wok has a bit of a flat bottom but still deep and round enough to allow me toss food around. If you Asian you’d know tossing is so important in cooking!!! Lol yea love this new wok, especially with this price, can’t beat it !"
This is an incredible show but I definitely don’t recommend it for young kids. The first time I watched it I was eight and I had nightmares for months. I watched it again when I was thirteen and it gave me chills it was so good. Not for kids. Tweenagers will love it.
"I am unsure why so many people ""panned"" this movie. A lack of imagination I suppose. This is not Barrie's story, it is a prequel if you will. It has humor and imagination and I loved it."
Excellent movie showing the beginning of the story before Peter and Captain Hook become enemies. I'm not too sure about the more modern type of songs they sing but all in all a very good movie.
Wonderful family movie and for adults it was so great we watched it 5 times once the action gets started it does not stop and what a wonderful twist
"Action, adventure, bright colors and costumes. It might be a little scary for young kids, but that depends on the kid. Mine are 5 & 8 they didn't have any problem."
"Out of 21 kids that spent the night for my daughter's birthday, over half picked pan to watch over all of the rest of the movies available as of may 22, 2016."
"James M. Barrie was the author of the original Peter Pan who wrote plays and produced the same in theatres. One main theme was boys and girls - sometimes adults - leaving the real world and going to Neverland. In 2015, a new DVD version debut of Peter Pan appeared. This new version was based on war orphans being kidnapped for mining labor and taken from World War II England during a Nazi bombing raid on flying mast ships that outran British spitfire aircraft?! Peter Pan is played by Levi Miller who is a 12 year old incredibly precocious boy actor augmented by the adult cast members Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund and Rooney Mara. A common theme in movies is people who are caught in the grips of war remain stable by momentary escapes into phantasy, and return to realities. This version is superb and worthy of a 5-Gold-Star-Rating for individual and family viewing."
An awesome spin on a classic movie!
Fantastic flick for kids and adults! All those questions from my childhood of how Peter Pan came to be were finally answered!
Best Peter Pan movie yet.
"Good movie, would recommend."
pleased
My son and I both enjoyed this.
I was well entertained
So fun!
Terrific.
Loved this movie.
Exciting and fun. I bought it because my kids loved it so much. I wonder if anyone who writes these poor reviews even have children.great movie.
"I know I am going against the grain here, but I thought this is be a great movie. As a 3d buff...I loved it. And if I was 12 years old again I really love it. It was just a fun filled, action packed, glorious movie. It had absolutely wonderful action scenes especially in 3D. Peter Pan before Neverland , I thought the story line quite believable for a fairy tale LOL . I could only wish for the sequel...which will never happen."
"Oh, this was a great musical. I've watched it 3 times already."
"This was a very nice prequel to J.M. Barre's work. It provides us with a plausible background for Peter Pan and makes for a good film. But it can be very frightening to younger children, unlike Barre's play, and ""Hook"", the sequel starring the late Robin Williams. I'm not sure what audience the producers were seeking, but I'm not sure they hit any of them. While it contains little in the way of offensive language, the terror of hideous monsters is very real. But not the slasher horror films that draw teenagers with the overt violence.  The only known star is Hugh Jackman who plays Blackbeard, the pirate. The rest were relative unknowns to me, but were all accomplished in their performances. I'm not sure that Jackman was ideal for the role, just as he was not ideal for his role in Les Miserables, the movie based upon the musical.  For these two reasons, I gave it four stars because I have to admit that I liked the film. I'll watch it again.  SPOILER Alert!  These are magical ships who can sail through the sky with no problems. Blackbeard takes orphaned boys from earth to work in the mines in Neverland, seeking to find the crystals of Pixem (pixie dust) for power. The pixies have gone underground and are protected by Tiger Lillie's tribe, who fight off the pirates. Pan meets up with James Hook, who, in this prequel is an Indiana Jones ""good guy"" throughout the film. Peter is strong willed, and a hero in waiting. He doesn't know what his heritage is, but eventually finds out that he is the son of a prince and a pixie mother.  The film opens with a very agile young woman leaving the infant Peter on the steps of the orphanage. The place is run by nuns who are anything but kind and gentle and caring. Peter is rebellious and along with nibs, cause all sorts of mischief, eventually finding the head nun's stash of coins and food, despite this being placed in World War II England.  It is from this orphanage that Blackbeard nabs the boys for work in his mines. Rather than go any further, some of the scenes reminded me of the film adaptation of the musical Oliver and I expected the orphan boys to break out singing Food, Glorious Food. They didn't but easily could have.  Hook is an interesting character. As I mentioned, he is an Indiana Jones type of character and the film bears some resemblance to the films. Altogether, an interesting film that kept us watching. Well paced."
Surprisingly good! My 6 and 3 year old were enthralled the entire movie.
Great movie for the kids
"This movie does not resemble anything JM Barrie wrote in the least. Some of the character names are the same, but it's nowhere near the same story. Yes, it's a ""prequel"" to the Peter Pan we know and love, but Barrie wrote a prequel to Peter's story as well. Tinkerbell spirits him away to Neverland after he ""runs away"" in his pram because he hears his mother discussing his future working in an office (Peter did NOT want to work in an office!). This story is more interesting than the one I just watched. I am curious as to why the Great Ormond Street Hospital would give the thumbs up for this film. Do they need the money that badly or has Barrie been dead a sufficient amount of years that they no longer care about maintaining the legacy of his stories? One reason I didn't give it 1 star was due to the performances of Hugh Jackman and Levi Miller. The other reason was because I got a 75 percent off coupon and rented it for a buck instead of four. If you're a fan of Pan and a completist, wait till there's a sale on if you really have to watch it. Otherwise skip it. You can get a much better skewed Pan story from season 3A of Once Upon a Time."
"A slightly different twist on an old favorite. This movie focuses on the back story of how Peter came into Neverland and how he met Captain James Hook. There are some similarities to the movie Hook but really this movie is its own story. Hugh Jackman clearly had fun playing the villain in the movie and the cast were all well suited to their roles. The actress in the role of Tiger-Lilly has been the point of some controversy, but if you can get past the fact that she is clearly not Native American, as audiences have no doubt come to expect, and take the acting itself for what it is then she does a good job in the role. Definitely not the best movie in the world but still a good addition to any good family movie collection."
"Whomever chose to have Hook as John Wanye is an idiot, including the actor. I AM........ JOHN HOOK. wtc?!? Well the kid and Jackman really make this film. I just can't handle Hook being ......urgh, let's just say, total crap. I blame the director.  Other than that. It's pretty enjoyable. I don't think that I wasted money on the rental. I ""kinda"" liked it.  I would have liked it more if the soundtrack was completely original. There was ABSOLUTELY NO NEED to have Nirvana nor the Ramones in this film..... I really don't understand why they did that. It cheapened the film. (though, they did do the tracks well in a new tempo and style)  It's ok, for an origin story. It did focus a ton on character in the first third, then went crazy after that.  Seriously dissapointed with Hook. I cannot stress that enough....  But at the end, I'm just an average Joe, ranting about like Joes do."
"I ignored the bad reviews. I like cheesy movies, and I love Peter Pan. I figured, how bad could it be?  To the number of reviewers who said things like, ""This is not the Peter Pan I know,"" I would argue that this is an original work and, as such, is required to bring its own interpretation to the characters and the story. That being said, it is still responsible for the choices that it makes for those characters and story...most of which make absolutely no sense.  Why is Hook an American cowboy? He is given no backstory whatsoever, which seems an odd choice for a prequel which is ostensibly introducing the character. In addition to that, his accent is so cartoonish that at first I assumed the actor must actually be foreign (no, he was apparently born in Minnesota), and his outrageous over-acting makes me want to throw something at the TV every time he opens his mouth.  Why change the real world setting from Victorian times to World War II? It's an interesting choice, but other than giving the pirate ship a chance to have a brief and gratuitous air battle with the Luftwaffe, it seems to hold no purpose. SO MUCH could have been done with that idea, and instead it's a total throwaway.  WHY DO THE SLAVES SING ""SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT""?? It was jarringly out of place, and the only hint at an explanation is Blackbeard's line shortly thereafter about Neverland ""spanning all places and all times"" or something like that. Like so many other things in this movie, it could have been a good idea, but was poorly executed and instead just felt random.  The movie is visually stunning, and young Levi Miller is definitely a talent to watch. Hugh Jackman chews up the scenery entertainingly. These facts bumped my review up to 2 stars. The movie has few other redeeming qualities. It's filled with interesting concepts, but no overall narrative structure to actually develop those concepts into a real perspective. It's difficult to imagine how the serious little orphan in search of his mother and the self-confidence to fulfill his destiny will become the carefree boy who refuses to grow up.  If you're looking for a prequel to Peter Pan, check out Nick Willing's 2011 ""Neverland"" TV miniseries. It too takes the position that Hook and Pan were friends before they were enemies, but unlike this movie, it actually shows the disintegration of that friendship as well, and truly sets the stage for the story that we all know and love. This one just falls flat."
"Badly directed- but entertaining. It felt like the director did not believe in the reality of the world he was creating and he was mostly about creating interesting imagery- the anachronistic musical number when the boys are bought to the city of the pirates is just painfully out of place. Hugh committed to the musical number but it was hard to see an actor of his merit doing something so awful. But he and all the actors were good in their roles. The Caucasian 30 something Tiger Lilly was weird- as was the MTV styled village of the multi-ethnic ""natives""- always felt like a set and costumes rather than a place that existed in a believable world. There is much that is visually wonderful and the boy at the center is excellent. I hope he has a good career ahead of him as he is good. But the directing/storytelling is truly atrocious."
perfect
I have no idea why the critics were so harsh. Our family adores it!
"Did you have to make the nuns soooo bad??? Otherwise, it was a really great adventure for the whole family. The performances were great. I had not heard of this movie so I thought is would have second rate effects, but it was top notch. And wholesome (with some PG violence). Hugh Jackman was amazing. I don't know what the negative reviews are about. It was clever, imaginative, surprising, funny, interesting, visually stunning and creative. A great ride!"
"The story has some interesting moments, some interesting CGI, way too much uninteresting CGI, a character we are supposed to grow to like because he is charismatic (that is always the issue with charisma, isn't it? It can't be turned on if it is not there), a young man playing Pan who while not being overly adorable still wore on my nerves just a little too heavily and dear merciful gods of Australia we get Hugh Jackman pounding through this thing like a tsunami. I think the director must have told him to not even come close to any behavior that could be considered briefly sane. I got the distinct feeling if Blackbeard was the headliner his opening act should have been Pennywise from IT. Shriekingly creepifying."
We ordered this with online redeemable points and thought it would be watched more but it is passed up more often than not.  Fun story. But not a repeat watcher.
I liked this version of peter pan in 3D..... it took me to watch a few times to like it.. not the movies fault just needed to be sitting down with out people bugging me. Alot of Action in it. it reminds me of Oliver twist type show. ALOT of 3D going on this movie.. that's a plus.
"My 9 year old son completely loved this movie. I enjoyed it as well but...there's about 10 sub-stories in this movie and it doesn't come close to closing up half of them. Hugh Jackman is good. I found the guy playing Hook a little distracting, something about the way he talked was distracting. The effects are well put together. I'd like to have seen the plot trimmed up a bit and spend a bit more time getting us to know/like Pan more."
"Had to have it in my collection! The main reason for the star subtraction is for Amazon not the movie!!!I just wish that Amazine would let me custom arrange my Video Library instead of only offering by date purchased or alphabetical order. I would prefer to arrange by genre, episode, number in franchise so that I could group my movies together instead of having a hodge podge to sort through!"
Great
"Extremely good movie, VERY well put together. I've gotta be honest, after watching the animated Peter Pan, Finding Neverland, Peter Pan (2003) & Hook I thought another Peter Pan movie was a stupid idea. I fought & fought not to watch it but, as it turned out, anytime we can sit & watch something as a family then I'll sit through anything. To my surprise, this version was very well thought out & put together beautifully, graphics are amazing! I recommend at LEAST renting it, the kids loved it!"
"Omg What more can I say then Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard ................AWESOME! I loved his evil character portrayal! This movie tells you how and why Peter Pan becomes the boy he has. The movie basically gives you the back story on how peter became Peter Pan. I thought the movie was quite entertaining. The whole family sat down and watched this over the kids Christmas break and we all enjoyed the movie. While I would not say it is a 5-star movie, it was still a funny and great family movie!"
"As an adult, I felt confused for about half of the movie. I could only imagine how children could figure out the plot/storyline on their own. The exposition is intriguing and the rising actions are exhilarating ... but a meaning behind the events and linking certain circustances was not easily grasped. Its a movie for children, and although I'm sure most children will just like it for its colors and action, but it should have meaning and substance for all viewers at all times."
"SOME SPOILERS::This isn't a bad movie, its just not a great movie. My boys 5 and 10 both enjoyed it. I found the changes to the story and the characters' basic personalities to be a bit contrived and kind of ruining the charm of the original story. Also why they decided WWII as compared to shall we say a much earlier war based on the fact that this is a pre-qual to events happening in the very early 1900s or late 1890s I don't know what they were thinking. I'm happy I didn't buy this movie and probably wont until its in the five dollar bin.  My main problems with this movie came right down to basic writing and some acting issues. first let me say Hugh Jackman was great fun and he appeared to be having great fun, there is nothing more enjoyable than watching a movie where people are having fun. Now comes my issue with the Black Beard character, Black Beard had a crazy mass of black hair and a giant black beard that he would have flints laced into that he would light so they would smoke and he would appear more menacing. a man prancing around in a bustle made of black feathers is not only not intimidating but its asinine and from long before the time of pirates such as Blackbeard, Blackbeard as an edition to the story isn't the part i mind its changing him to be moderately ridiculous in looks and mildly in demeanor which bother me. He is the predecessor to the original hook except rather than handsome and ice cold as originally described by Barry he looks like a Emo Goth old man. And while the character was cruel he wasn't icy cold. he was manipulative he was just cruel.  this brings us to Hook. I don't know what happened here, I don't know at what point they thought continuing with a accent that was off and not great from the start was better than an English James Hook but some one did. I don't know why they changed Hook's character at all honestly. he was always a Sailor according to Barry, a well educated, charming, handsome, manipulative, cold, cruel, cowardly, terrifying presence. I don't know why the writer / director chose to veer away from that. I can understand working they way up to cold, cruel and terrifying I really can, we saw a peek of the manipulative, Educated and Charming not so much. Handsome well if the actor hadn't been struggling so hard with the accent and there for making his mouth and eyes do very strange and unnatural movements i'm sure that would have been there. Over all this character was by far the most disappointing to lovers of the Original Pan story, hell I like Hook from Jake and the Neverland Pirates by far more than this.  Peter, well he's a kid so i'm a lot less judgmental. he's a kid after all and hes learning. Not the best Pan I've seen. I'll take Jeremy Sumpter's lisp over this kid any day though. Still he did well. with exception of the time period its not a bad orgin story for him. The idea of his mother leaving him at an orphanage not bad, the idea that he is some kind of Messiah for Neverland, ok sure. The part where he is a boy afraid of heights but can fly, i'm a little more meh on that. He also doesnt seem quite mischievous enough for Peter Pan. he seems also very aware of consequences although Pan in the original stories doesnt. He has no grasp of such adult ideas of consequence or if he has its a very childish (like a four year olds grasp) this kid's character was very aware of consequences which made him fearful. Sadly the orgin story kind of took away some of that carefree mischief from Peter. Still not a totally unlikable character and although I wasn't a fan of the kid, he did alright. after all they say even the worst actor can look wonderful with the right director, writing and costars. This kid sadly had bad writing, apparently a meh director and his costars outside of Jackman where also Meh.  Tiger lily's character was another meh thing in this movie. I thought Mara did well, but really her character didn't do much for me. She was thrown in more so as a love interest for Hook than as a truly needed character to the plot. Honestly, they could have picked the Chief, or hell Tinker Bell to fill the role Tiger Lilly played and it would have had the same effect. Hell they could have picked a younger woman since traditionally speaking Tiger Lilly and Peter aren't that far apart in age. Hell they could have picked a kid that ethnically and age wise fit the role and still no difference would have been made. But people would be creeped out by a 30 some odd year old man with a truly creepy accent Hitting on a 13 year old. Again Mara did well just the love interest was unneeded and her character was interchangable.  I guess maybe that is my problem with this movie is nothing about it wasn't interchangable. I loved the Peter Pan movie from 2003. Jason Issac was exactly what one would imagine for Hook, Jeremy Sumpter ok not English and had a bit of a lisp but still completely embodied the ideal of Peter Pan. Hell even the Hook movie, Dustin Hoffman wonderful, Robin Williams, may he rest in peace, wonderful wonderful sequel. There was a movie on sify a few years ago, another orgin story which by far was better than this and a much lower budget, the acting was better, the storyline was better. Still not keeping all the way with the original but you could see how Hook became Hook and Peter became Peter Pan. I love the idea for a prequal just this movie didn't do well with me. I saw another viewer mention this movie set up for a sequel. I would hope if they do so choose to do this that they would worry less about names and effects and worry more about the characters and the story. I would seriously consider some recasting."
"Originally viewed this movie with a friend (her DVD). Thoroughly enjoyed it so purchased this DVD at a good price for my own library. I can easily recommend this prequel to the familiar classic story. The computer graphics and great acting were wonderful, capturing the magic and adventure of this story. I'm sure it will be a great favorite. Especially enjoyed Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard and the other actors did a great job too."
My 10 year old son really enjoyed it as did his friend. I enjoyed it too although the adult acting was not worthy of any awards. I laughed at how bad it was a few times. But the Pan character was well done and I think boys and girls would enjoy this. I did enjoy it. There are a few scary scenes (nothing major) but my son managed and he gets frightened easily. Good for family movie night or kid sleepover.
"My kids really enjoyed this. A slightly different take on the Peter Pan story. Personally, as an adult, it did not completely keep my attention, but that may just be me as I am rather tired of Peter Pan retellings. However, my kids really liked this and how it told the younger years and Peter's history, as well as young James Hook and Blackbeard. The kids tell me this was a good one, and so we are rating it 4-stars!"
"PAN got panned and that's a shame. If this action-adventure came out in the early 1980's it might have been heralded as a blockbuster crafted by Spielberg or Lukas . So what went wrong?  As yet another iteration of Sir Barre's Peter Pan, this film is a mess. Even if it were a great Peter Pan, I believe it is safe to say that movie audiences had no appetite for another Peter Pan in the winter of 2015. As a prequel to the Peter Pan story, there are still great possibilities here, but hey-- without strong word of mouth, would you run to see a Peter Pan prequel? Where does this leave us?  Simple--FORGET ABOUT PETER PAN. PAN is fabulously entertaining pop corn fare featuring adorable characters,cinematic creativity, execution, editing, direction and mind-blowing visuals.  Aye, there be plenty to irk the cynic in ye.  From the very first minute of screen time, PAN is introduced as a story about ""how best friends can become mortal enemies"". The whimsical voice-over makes it apparent we're talking about Peter Pan and Captain Hook. A pretty good premise--only PAN has nothing at all to do with conflicted advisories, friends, or good and evil for that matter. The audience is all set up for a morality play the likes of Moses and Ramases --but that premise/plot never happens or unfolds--not even a hint!  If you can get past the misleading premise, and come to grips with James Hook portrayed as a Han Solo and Peter Pan as a juvenile Luke Skywalker, then you'll have a ball with PAN. Oh yes--Tiger Lilly is played as a Princess Leia who urges Pan to ""use the Force"". to discover his destiny. Yikes! Sound ridiculous? Well then, try this on for size--if you never saw Star Wars or heard of Peter Pan (hell, there's even a lot of Indiana Jones thrown in for good measure) you'd come away saying, ""What an incredible Motion Picture!"" Don't get me wrong--this is not some befuddled mish-moosh of archetypes. The damn thing works! It is fun and charming; a jolly good adventure roller-coaster ride --all accented by great music scoring , sound and set design, marvelous cinematography, and gee--if you haven't figured it out yet, I love this film!  So, if you are inclined to be a cynical film critic type out for blood, there is much here to sink your teeth into. HOWEVER, if you can only sit back and marvel at the spectacle, laughs, thrills and chills of this first-class motion picture entertainment, you may discover where the magic is these days. Go ahead and rent it!"
"Bad costume design, shallow character development, poor acting. Basically all CG eye candy and a formulaic predictable plot. Tolerable but disappointing. I give it 3 stars because younger kids that have been raised on this sort of garbage will probably like it. Its not the worst."
"I looked forward with anticipation for this movie. As a little boy my Mom used to read to me the fantastic tales from PETER AND WENDY, the original title and and early publication the the works, I loved NEVERLAND, another pre-history of Peter and the Lost Boys, but I feared this film may have been a flop. There has been a fury of expensive movies lately that had bombed such as EX0DUS. However, I liked this one; I found it extremely well produced, excellent cast (especially Peter) and outstanding special effects. Some of the effects almost overwhelm the viewer, Note: I don't know what happened to the rest of my reviews, but take my word for it; if you like fastasys and great special effects, you will like this one, though the visiuals you may find are a bit overwhelming! FiveStars and I got mine from Amazon.  and I saw it in 2D not 3D though I have the 3D Dvd here; I did not see it in the theater. This was much darker than I thought it would be: I thought it would be more cartoony than NEVERLAND, but it was about the same. Not really a childrens movie, this seemed more for people like me who grew up with the original story. It is very violent at times, but at the end the good guys win (for the moment). We meet most of the familiar cast such as Smee and Hook. Here, Hook was well cast as a rather INDIANA JONES look a like and act a like. Brave at times, interested at times only in his own interests. And had the hots for Tiger Lilly! Neverland here is well portayed with very serrealistic settings (filmed in Vietnam I read) as well as the big Warner Bros Studios north of London. Some beautiful photography spliced in with an outstanding musical background. This was made at the same place JUPITER ASCENDING was done. I liked that movie very much also. Some similar weirdness here and there and I lumped these two movies in ""unusual category"" along with TOMORROWLAND and INTERSTELLER (which s**ked) but never the less I really liked PAN & JUPITER and recommend them both, especially PAN. FIVE STARS for excellent cast (especially Peter), super music, great special effects and steady entertainment (few lulls!). And a creepy Blackbeard! Kind of an odd movie but very entertaining. Enjoy!"
"The movie starts out a little bit vague, but within a few minutes, things start to fall in place. Without giving out any spoilers, I will say that. My wife and I watched this in 3D on our person TV (not at the theaters) and we both enjoyed it very much. It is a little bit different twist on the story that we read when growing up, but it is a good twist. I wonder if there is a sequel in the works. It would fill the gap as of how the story played out and the stories we read when I was a kid.  The acting was very good. A lot of CGI, but well worth the effort. The 3D was superb. Every little detail was excellent of the quality of the video. We watched it as night in a dark room about 6 ft away from the 65 inch Sony TV. You could see everything, even the thin little hairs on the actors were in clear view.  The price is a bit high, but taking in consideration as to how well this movie was put on blu-ray, we are not complaining (much). Would we recommend our friends you watch this in 3D? Yes. Would we buy a sequel? If it is as good as this one, we would."
"It's 4/18/20 and the first time I've seen this movie. I'm a cynical old fart and Amidst the Covid 19 pandemic I was literally taken away from all it's threats by this film. I became my childhood self while watching and believed in every moment of good versus evil. And to dream we can...instead of we can't. I didn't want it to end. Script, story line, cinematography, cast and direction all exemplary. No sequels please. This movie stands (by it's self)...alone."
"Pan was severely mis-marketed in my eyes. It was marketed I remember to children but this rendition of Pan is more suitable for the adults taking kids to see it then anything. Pan glosses over the WWII backdrop it's placed in with an early and late scene that involves the Blitzkrieg over England, a fact of life I don't believe many in the American audience truly know much about. Some recent British TV and films have started to include it in there work, like Brits are now comfortable talking about it some 70 plus years later. Aside from the Blitz, Peter is in an orphanage, abandoned by his mother with parkour-like abilities (you'll see in the opening of the film) and light on her feet. Peter notices more children have gone missing and with the help of his best friend they stay up late one night to find out what's going on. Peter and his best bud stay up late and go on the hunt of the evil nuns who run the orphanage. They find Peter's letter that his mother wrote him which he has never seen. He cannot read it due to what seems to be dyslexia (another point of interest that is more a detail of storyline then I believe people figured out) but his friend goes on about why his mother left him those years ago. Peter has renewed hope of seeing her. As the two boys go through the treasure trove of goods being horded for rationing by the nuns, they run into whose been taking the children, pirates who come down and snatch them from the roof of the orphanage. Peter is grabbed as well as his friend but the boy escapes the clutches of one pirate, while Peter stays behind on the ship.  As Peter, the other boys and the pirates enter a netherworld, neither here on Earth but more of a scene of a ripple in space time, where the planets and stars are all around. This would be a good time to smoke a bowl or take a trip on LSD. The audience is then treated to Neverland, where bubbles of water hold schools of fish and marine life and a giant island floating in the clouds. Then the film becomes a half musical, something the trailers never got into. To the tune of Nirvana with floating pirate ships and an open pit quarry, we meet Captain (before he is one) Hook, Black Beard (Hugh Jackman) and Mr. Smee among others. Peter is interested of what they are mining for? The answer is pixum or pixie dust that is in large quantities (or at least used to be on the island) that in a Jurassic Park like way is now fossilized. What pixum is used for is only hinted at as well until a scene with Blackbeard in his Captains Quarters showing his true age and then the effects pixum has. Pixum is really a fountain of youth like substance when inhaled it keeps you forever young. Lets just say Michael Jackson would've loved this film. I imagine he must've liked Dorian Grey too... We learn Hook only wants to escape and when Peter is said to be a liar and a thief, Blackbeard tries him and throws him off Queen Anne's Revenge. Peter then briefly flies or well floats, and when Peter realizes this to be the case, this is when he doesn't believe he is doing it whereby he falls to the ground and is knocked out unconscious. Peter awakes and is questioned by Blackbeard, asked if he has ever flew before? The answer is obviously no but we learn a bit about the man Blackbeard was and some of the story behind Neverland. Peter is put in the prison cell just for safe keeping. Hook and Peter escape however and with Mr. Smee in tow, they get out by hijacking another pirate ship.  Once free of the mines, they have a hard landing in the jungle and stumble upon Princess Tiger Lily and her island people. Peter, Hook and Smee are taken prisoner. Hook himself is then set to fight against the chieftain's warrior. His skills are legit and he was very impressive. Peter is found to have a necklace with what is called the ""Pan."" Hook is saved as the Chieftain stops the fight and tells us what the Pan is. Legend has that whomever wears the Pan, will save Neverland from Blackbeard. We also learn here more of Peter's mother and how Peter was always meant to return. More action ensues when Blackbeard and his many crews search for Peter, Hook and Smee. Smee then sells Hook and Peter's location out to Capt. Blackbeard himself. Now I felt that the almost sexual tension between Rooney Mara and Garrett Hedlund (Hook) unbearable and some serious off-camera hook-ups (no pun intended) was definitely going on. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's just two actors skillfully pulling off ""hard to get love"" but my gut doesn't think so. During the battle of Blackbeard and his goons versus the Princess and her tribe ends in a playful bloodbath if I can put it that way. If this were a PG-13 or R rated film, there'd be blood everywhere. It felt a lot like how some video games get away with a Teen rating when obviously blood and gore is present in your mind but it's not seen. Instead of the blood and bullets, we see colorful explosions of smoke whenever a tribal member is killed. That's right kids, war is just like the Indian celebration of Holi... So beyond the creative spin on what a gun battle is like and the white-washing of Tiger Lily (good job Hollywood...) the natives are a pretty good cast of characters until they're basically wiped out in a 5 minute fight.  Peter, Hook and Tiger Lily however escape with their lives. They go further on into the jungle and come across the crocodiles, mermaids (who are also Victoria Secret Clone Angels) and a new ship, The Jolly Roger which Hook tidies up for himself to get off the island and go back to where he was originally from... America's pioneering West? That's my take at least. Beyond this Hook leaves Tiger Lily and Peter only to come to their rescue when Peter, Tiger Lily and Blackbeard open the door to the fairy world. In a Han Solo rip-off (which is exactly how the relationship between Princess Leia and Han plays out in Star Wars - Tiger Lily and Hook have the same relationship) Hook comes back with the Jolly Roger (insert Millennium Falcon) and saves the day against Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge (insert Death Star and Darth Vader). Before that takes place however there's a Nazi flame thrower scene where Blackbeard and his crew burn the fairies to ashes. A play on the WWII timeline I imagine. After Blackbeard is gone for good, with Peter saving the day we're led back to the London Orphanage whereby Peter takes more boys back to Neverland. There's also a wink wink wait for it, Pan 2 nod but with the poor box office turnout that Pan did, I don't see it happening any time soon. Most likely another Peter Pan reboot will happen in the future. My mind to Hollywood, stop with the Peter Pan reboots and just go with an original storyline! We can always wish for something right? In the end Pan was definitely better for the adult crowd, I'd pin it for those 15 - 30 years of age than anyone younger or older. A mis-managed and terribly marketed movie should be seen if you like semi-musicals and the Peter Pan universe."
"If you're a Jackman fan, and female, you may not like him in this role. He first appears wearing what looks like the top half of a woman's dress. It has a ruffled, layered, fish tail in back, and the collar, couldn't make it out. It was made up of circles, or feathers. And he wore an elaborate wig that was rolled up in the back, with exaggerated arched edges on the front and sides. The red stockings made his legs look spindly. I kept looking for him till I realized he was Blackbeard. About halfway through the movie, you discover what his goal and purpose is; to live forever, and stay young doing it. Just as he almost accomplishes this, he's defeated, and dies. The narcissistic pirate looks morosely into the camera as he and his demolished ship falls from a great height, disappearing into the depths of a ginormous cave. And Hollywood continues its hatred of religion and people of faith. The nuns who run the orphanage have some sort of deal with Blackbeard, to allow him to kidnap children in return for gold, treasure, and food. The nuns are fat, abusive, evil, and despicable. Why not have the orphanage proprietors be two spinsters, instead of Catholic nuns? Is no one else offended by this hateful cliché? Garrett is a talented actor, who's proven in Tron Legacy, he can carry a movie on his own. I'd like to see him in more great roles. His James Hook slides back and forth from bad to good, and makes it believable. It was a nice surprise that he and Tiger Lily are attracted to each other. Though his bad side peeps through, he has control over it for now, so that Tiger Lily begins showing her feelings by side glances, and micro expressions of love. When their hands touch on the ships wheel, Garrett's hand lingers for just a mili-second longer before pulling it away and stepping aside. Both actors did an excellent job here in an electric scene that told volumes. Parents will appreciate that there's no clutching or swapping spit, but the discerning will know what's going on. The boy as Pan, did an outstanding job. There's not many youngsters who are this talented, that can handle such a role, and working with big names. Naturally, at the end, you wonder if there might be a sequel. We hear Pan ask Hook if they'll be friends forever. Hook replies; ""Sure kid! What could possibly go wrong?"" Well, everything. I was drawn to the movie by the trailer, and rented it. Which I'm glad, cos I would've wasted money if I'd bought it. The special FX are super wow, the movie keeps a steady, fast pace. I can see that it'd be mesmerizing to children. As an adult, I didn't care for it. I think Jackman made a mistake in accepting this role; that's my opinion."
"Loved this movie. A departure from the traditional story but with a great message about friendship and believing in yourself. I admit, the all-white cast was a little off-putting. I've heard it said that Neverland only consists of children from England, but even that isn't a good excuse. So, I docked it a star for not being diverse. Otherwise, a fun family film that my boys loved."
"Wtf. This movie had such great potential. I was looking forward to seeing the progression of Captain Hook, from where he started to the Hook we all know and love. Never happened. From the mermaid lagoon until the end, the movie is so lame. Maybe they are setting up for a Pan 2? Idk, but this could have been a great movie about character development."
"This film was truly a top notch adventure with tons of action, amazing visuals and interesting characters. My daughters aged 7 and 9 liked it as much as I did. Our youngest gets scared at blood, anger, violence – and it amazed me that through this whole scary tale, even a scratch on Blackbeard's head that included a little blood, never triggered her ""flight"" reaction, so what a win-win there. All the while, this was an adventure engaging enough that I was thoroughly entertained. The use of modern music usually kills a period piece for me. I can't watch Moulin Rouge or the latest Great Gatsby, I mean ever. I can't enjoy that. But amazingly, when the entire population of pirates sang a Nirvana song (""I feel stupid and contagious, here we are now, entertain us"") and later when a Clash song was the backdrop, I was fine. The Nirvana thing broadsided me, to be sure, but I was so caught up in the movie I made a conscious decision not to blow the fun by crying foul. Filmmakers seem to think suspension of disbelief is no longer an issue. Yes, pierce the fourth wall occasionally if you are doing it well, but when you rip the space-time continuum by establishing the film is in the time of Nazi bombing runs over London and then have pirates sing a Nirvana song, you are messing with my ability to enjoy your art. But like I said, everything else was so good about this movie that I forgave the offence. Enjoy!"
"The opening dance number was rather strange. It seemed to be there to highlight Jackman's talents, more than to set a tone for the movie. Using a golden oldie was a sellout, rather than getting up an original number for the movie. It was strange because the rock n roll theme stopped there, and we were shot back to 1940's London. I remember Jackman's performance better than the other actors, he showed some nuance and delicacy with his performance, unlike the bludgeoning of the guy who played Hook. Nothing like transplanting the character of Indiana Jones into a Peter Pan movie. It says something, that I can't remember the names of any of the other actors in the movie. If the performances had been 'that good', I would have remembered them. I am sure younger children will enjoy it, and forgive a lot of bad acting, for the beautiful sets and good special effects. For an adult who loves Peter Pan, this is not the movie to recommend to them."
"Lots of special effects but I feel like they forget something....to write an interesting story to go with it. After watching what seemed like many hours, I finished the moving feeling detached from the characters. At the end I just felt sad...because the one happy thing they finished with was that Peter Pan and James Hook were friends....and we all know how well that goes."
"The film is wonderfully colored, the sets are perfect, truly a beautifully filmed movie. The story is a bit weak, with over the top performances by James Hook (Hedlund) character, it felt heavy handed and distracted from an otherwise nearly perfect film. Hugh Jackman's role was terrific, very enjoyable in every scene. Overall I came away with a renewed sense of wonderment, and this Peter Pan back-story feels natural and a fantastic reboot of a classic, leaving room for additional movies. This though feels a bit contrived, an obvious set-up for the next movie. I loathe when I movie plays as a set-up for the next in the series (if there is a next). luckily this movie didn't quite stoop to this level, it does become apparent later on in the film, I suppose as it should.  Add it to your list, a worthy though flawed work, highly enjoyable."
"the cast, the soundtrack and others about this movie i think is a good movie to watch with the kids or even with friends i find it funny when funny and just all around a great movie whatever age you are"
My daughter loves this movie. I think it's a cool version of Peter pan.
Not good for too many reasons to list.
"""This movie has good and bad reviews,"" there's abundant energy,the kid his acting was remarkable.Hugh Jackman is hateful and cruelty.So many like me,dislike that,ha,ha, we like him as a hero.Was quite different story of the previous ones,and was a little confused,I wanted to see the boy to flying more and the ships in the water,ha,ha, Thelma"
"It is ok for a kid. It reminded me of Moulin Rouge at the beginning with the singing, which worried me. I am not impressed by too many musicals. Just not into them. It was a little hard for me to not fast forward. A bit corny on the writing for me but it was made for kids, I hope. A bit to grand little for a kids movie, or trying to be grand, I shall say. Hook reminded me of Indiana Jones wanna be and did not like the way he spoke, seemed wrong somehow, I hope he is a better actor than that. I do not go by reviews and neither should anyone else, it is a matter of taste and should be decided for one's self. I am not a movie critic Take a chance and if anything, it is not the worst or the best. Make sure a kid (depending on age) sees it, they will like it I suppose. Did like the way they used fabric in the village, do not know why I mentioned it but I love fabric art. What was the colored smoke about? It seemed liked they hurried through the fantasy characters, like the mermaids, fairies, etc, because Peter Pan, Fairies and flying, it was slow in coming on, the things that make these types of movies interesting. They should have spent a bit more time and money on them and cut down on the dizzying ships scenes and the fighting."
"Great special effects, costumes, scenery, and cinematography Great acting & directing. Hugh Jackman stands out as the hardened greedy Blackbeard. Garrett Hedlund stands out & beguiles as Captain James Hook. Rooney Mara stands out as Tiger Lily. Levi Miller plays Pan with understated panache"
"It was a good movie but left me wanting more. Thenot again maybe that was the point. Either way it's a good origin story for the Peter Pan dynasty (I like the original myself, but hey). Amazon Prime is great no lost movies, no tears, no scratches, works everything and it's there like a good friend. It has decluttered and simplified my life."
Why can't anyone get a Pan movie right?? This was one of the worst movies EVER! ZERO STARS!! This movie is a mistake.
very happy thank you
"Good movie, I have a little sister who didn't see it but would have liked it so it is geared more towards a younger audience although I liked it. Lots if CGI effect unlike other Peter Pan movies I have seen. The CGI reminded me of the movie the Polar Express with Tom Hanks only this had real humans in it, plus Hugh Jackman was good."
It doesn't feel like Peter Pan. This movie did not capture the essence.
"It's a really fun Peter Pan story. Worth a watch, maybe 2 or 3, or 5 if you really enjoy it. The cast is vibrant and sometimes comically over-dramatic but I loved it and it has some dark moments and a lot of action. Watch for the action and the effects and just let your mind go for a ride, you don't need to do much thinking for this fun Peter Pan movie."
"My kids weren't immediately interested in seeing the movie, but after it got going it definitely captured their attention. We all want to see how the story continues and makes Peter and Hook enemies. The musical aspect of the movie wasn't expected, but it was that much more fun. It was definitely a great movie for the whole family."
"Cooking on cast iron is an art. I grew up with these as a child so I instinctively know what to do. Some aficionados here on Amazon pride themselves on seasoning their cookware with flax seed oil. My dad was a professional chef and we never did that when I was a kid so I don't do that now.  It's really simple. You never cook dry. This is old school cooking 101. You never pour a cake mix into a baking pan without buttering the pan. And you never put anything on a heated griddle unless you oil or butter it first. When I bought this I decided to try coconut oil and it works pretty well.  Another reviewer advised against vegetable oil and he's right in the sense that if you overheat vegetable oil on a griddle you will essentially create a glue that will cause things to begin to stick to the griddle. This isn't a problem if you're vigilant and avoid burning the vegetable oil. But the better advice is simply not to mess with it.  As has been mentioned by others, if you always treat the surface before cooking on it, you won't have any trouble with anything sticking to it EVER. I bought this to make pancakes and it's been nothing but joy. I also filled the entire pan with egg batter and made scrambled eggs and then mixed that in a mixing bowl with rice which I had made in the rice cooker to produce egg-fried rice. Worked great.  There's nothing like cooking on cast iron. It creates a self-contained uniform heat that produces wonderfully consistent results. On the other hand, when used without care, it produces burnt food that seemingly requires a jackhammer before you can remove it from the pan. If you're a patient person you'll do fine. If you think cooking goes faster by turning the burner on high, then this is not for you.  The best advice I can give is to ALWAYS keep it oiled. Until you get used to it, UNDER heat rather than overheat. If you overheat with a cheap oil, you now have glue and you have failed to ALWAYS keep it oiled (not glued). The natural result of producing glue will be food sticking to the pan. If you fail to remove ALL of the glue, you will CHRONICALLY experience food sticking.  Heat the griddle slowly. Run some cold water on your hand. Then flick the water onto the pan. When the water bubbles up and evaporates the surface is ready for cooking. If the water immediately steams off, the surface is too hot. Turn down the burner and wait. DO NOT PUT FOOD ON THE SURFACE until it cools down some. When it has cooled down, re-oil the surface. Do the flick test again and if the water bubbles and then evaporates, you're ready to cook.  Remember, cast iron stores and maintains heat. It doesn't get instantly hot. And turning the burner on high won't make things happen any faster. Don't go past medium. Give it a chance to store the heat.  If you turn the burner on high, here's what happens: The griddle begins storing LOTS of heat. But it still is warming up slowly. By the time you think that the cast iron is hot, it has STORED up a tremendous amount of heat. It's WAY too hot. At that point you turn down the heat. But it doesn't matter because the heat is STORED. At this point, the former vegetable oil is now turning into plastic. And it's at this point that the fool begins to cook. The food now begins bonding to the plastic. And any further cooking just enhances the bonding process.  The fool's conclusion: ""cast iron is no good.""  If you're an impatient person, this is not for you. If want to watch television and knit while you're cooking, this is not for you. However, if you enjoy cooking and you're looking for an item that will improve and enhance your results, this is definitely for you. Take your time. Begin slowly warming up the griddle in advance while you're mixing up ingredients so that you don't have to rush. I love this griddle and you will too! Just remember: Easy Does It."
"This is by far the most low maintenance pan I own. People don't believe it when I say it; because most people who don't believe it don't know how to cook. I am sorry if it sounds harsh; truth often is. Now that we have gotten that out of the way; I will try to be as helpful as possible below. As I am an Informations Major; apologies in advance; old habits are hard to break; I will try to put in more information about a cast iron griddle than you ever wanted to know; and more information than you will ever need to know.  ~~~~~~ Treatise on Lodge L9OG3 Cast Iron Round Griddle ~~~~~~  1) The Background on why when done properly, cast iron is very non-stick  I make the blanket statement that if you are spending more than 30 seconds cleaning this griddle; you have screwed up. I literally spend less than 10 seconds cleaning this griddle; I use this and the 10.25"" (L8SK3) Skillet so often that there is actually no place for them in my cupboard (on purpose), they live on the stove permanently.  Before we get to the cleaning; we need to get to the non-sticking. Let me explain how cast iron seasoning works, and why when done right it's more non-stick than teflon. Cast iron, as the name implies is ""cast"" into shape. They make a mold (usually out of sand) and then molten iron is poured into the cast. When it has cooled and formed; the mold is removed; and you have (in this case) your griddle. Because the iron is poured in liquid form; there are tiny bubbles and imperfections on the surface. Years ago; Lodge use to sandblast as a final stage to smooth out the surface; they do not do this anymore; but it does not make it any less non-stick. When you pour oil on the cast iron; as it is porous; some oil gets absorbed into the nooks and crannies of the cast iron surface. When you cook something with a fat in it; (or any hydro-carbon) and you overheat it; you essentially burn it. All the gunk burns off and what is left is near pure carbon (why a well seasoned cast iron is deep black). So when you season cast iron; that is what you are doing, you are putting some sort of fat onto it; letting it burn, and leaving only the carbon footprint on the surface. This black surface is called a Patina. Carbon bonds are pretty tough; and so a good Patina will essentially leave the surface of the cast iron with a very thin layer of pure carbon. In a horizontal lattice structure; the bond is strong horizontally; and forms a slippery surface. So before we begin even talking about cleaning; you have to have a good Patina on your griddle. Google ""how to season cast iron"" and you will come up with a thousand articles and a few thousand Youtube videos.  2) Making your griddle non-stick is the first part of easy cleaning  So you have done your homework; and you have seasoned your griddle. Good! Now here is the secret that nobody is going to tell you but me. Let's say you wanted to make pancakes on this griddle; here's what you do; and if you follow my instructions to the letter; I GUARANTEE you the most non-stick griddle you've ever used.  Let's talk oils:  You want something that can hold up to high heat. Extra Virgin Olive oil is a HORRIBLE choice. Do a search on ""smoke point of oil"" and take a look at the chart. If you are asking me for a recommendation as far as oil; it would go: Ghee (485F), Pig Lard (370F), Avocado Oil (520F). In that order. You want something that has no solids (so no butter, it burns) and something that has a high smokepoint. Most people use something like grapeseed oil, extra virgin olive oil etc.. and they all will gum up; making your griddle very sticky. Stick with the 3 oils I mentioned above; and you will be fine. (I personally use ghee if available when I cook meats; all other times I use Avocado Oil. If I'm deep frying though; I prefer Lard).  Now here's what you do (Seriously do EXACTLY as I say): You've decided you want pancakes; great. Take your oil or lard, and pour it on the COLD griddle. COLD. Take a paper towel, and rub it all around until its even; a thin light coating. Now go ahead and put the griddle on the stove; and fire it up; on low/medium low heat. With the back side of the same paper towel; as you start to see the griddle sweat oil (and it will) wipe it like you are buffing a car with car wax. Small circles; making sure there are no pools of oil anywhere. Once you think the griddle has stopped sweating; add a little bit of oil (I know, it sounds counter-intuitive as I just wiped oil off; but it's not) and cook your pancakes. They will be SUPER non-stick.  Here's why it works. Remember I said that the cast iron is porous? So when you rub oil on it COLD; the oil will not seep into the crevices. It will sit on top of those crevices. As the griddle gets heated however; the oil will become much lower in viscosity, and flow in and fill those porous surfaces. The excess is seen as ""oil sweat"". When the griddle is hot; and you've wiped it down well; what you don't see is a very thin layer oil on top of the surface, this is now your non-stick surface! When you add oil; it lubricates the griddle so when you pour pancake batter or something; it will be less likely to stick.  So you are wondering, how is this different than heating up the griddle then adding oil to it? You can answer this for yourself. Heat up a stainless steel pan if you have one. When it's hot; throw a few water drops on it; you will see the water drops dance around. Why? Because the pan is hot; and so when the water touches it; the bottom side vaporizes and causes a mini explosion, sending the droplet into the air. Now what if you had water in the pan and heated it? You'd see the water sizzle but not jump around.  When you heat the griddle; and then add oil; there is heat (and perhaps a little moisture) trapped in the porous surface; and trying to get oil into that surface will NOT happen. The nooks and crannies have hot air trapped in it; so oil can't penetrate into it. So you have a dry griddle with oil floating on top; and when you pour pancake mix; the oil actually PARTS and now you have pancake batter on a hot dry griddle. No wonder your pancakes stick! Doing it my way will super-non-stick your pan. Incidentally; you can do this to a stainless steel pan and get the same effect!  3) Stiff Nylon Brush and Hot water is your friend  If you have followed my instructions above; and have not turned the heat up so high or so long as to burn the griddle completely; and you are finished using it; then cleanup should be a 10 second affair, and not more. Because what you fail to realize until now; is that if you used the method above; you are SEASONING your griddle AS YOU ARE COOKING. So when you are done; the color will be a deeper black; and the griddle will be non-stick (more non-stick!). At this point; go ahead and get hot water running in the sink. When the water is hot; take your griddle over; and under hot running water; scrub vigorously with a stiff nylon brush for 10 seconds. You shouldn't use soap.. EVER! Soap will strip the Patina and possibly rust your pan! If you have done as I taught; your pan will be completely clean in 10 seconds. I know for a fact because I do this everyday. If there is a hard to clean spot; it means you haven't done as I said! Don't worry; pour a little bit of baking soda on that area; and scrub with the nylon brush. That's it! If you ran hot water while doing this; then turn off the water; shake the excess water off; and with a clean paper towel, wipe it dry. While the griddle is warm; go ahead and rub a little bit of oil ALL AROUND (that means bottoms and handles too!) making sure every surface is coated with a very thin layer of oil. Let it sit and rest. Next day; you can if you so choose; wipe off the excess oil as it too will sweat a little bit of oil.  That is it! We eat 20 meals a week at home, and this griddle is involved in at least 18 of them. Do you think I have time to scrub scrub scrub until my elbows creek? Of course not. If the food doesn't taste good cooked from it; then the pan is a fail; regardless of price. If it's not easy to clean; then the pan is a fail. If it doesn't last, it's a fail. If food from it is unhealthy; it's a fail. This pan scores and scores well in all these categories; but ESPECIALLY cleaning! People come over to eat; and see my cast iron skillets and they literally feel bad for me; thinking I'm going to be scrubbing until the cows come home; and are amazed that no pans I own take more than 10 seconds on my part to clean. Having owned cast iron; I can't imagine owning regular pans simply because of the cleaning involved!  4) Why Cast Iron  So we've talked about cleaning; but we haven't talked about why cast iron. If you take a google at the list of thermal conductivity, you will be surprised. Aluminium scores in the 200's, Copper scores a 385, Silver scores a 405, and stainless steel scores a 16. Granite scores a 2. Cast Iron scores a very low 55. So what we can conclude from this information is: There's a reason why a lot of chefs like copper bottom pans; it conducts thermal activity well. There is a reason why some of the stainless steel skillets add an aluminium sandwich core; to increase the thermal conductivity of the pan overall. With a score of 55 though; cast iron is not very thermally conductive. That means it's slow to heat up; but that also means however; once it heats up; it won't cool quickly. This is what you need essentially when you sear something, or if you want to gently heat something. (Tangent; from the chart; this is why a lot of people swear granite rock steak is the best on earth.)  Because cast iron heats slowly; you should really never use anything past a medium heat; heating it too quickly can cause it to crack. So low heat and more warm up time is the better way to go.  So what does all this mean if I'm cooking a steak? Well, it means if I throw a piece of cold meat (incidentally; you should NEVER put a piece of cold steak onto a hot grill or griddle; the meat should be room temp or slightly colder than room temp). It means that when you throw your piece of meat on the griddle; because of the ability of the cast iron the retain its heat; it will not ""dump"" all the heat into the steak quickly; and the pan itself get cold. This is also why if you cook a steak in an aluminum pan; it scorches. What happens is; when you heat an aluminum pan; and then put a piece of steak on it; with the great thermal conductivity of aluminum; all the heat leaves the pan quickly; so the pan is now cold. The fire underneath then is struggle to bring the pan back up to temp; and by it time it does; the steak has lost all it's moisture through evaporation and there is no searing or browning, you end up with a tough piece of dried steak.  Because cast iron does not dump all it's temp right away; when you put food on cast iron; the surface temperature does not drop dramatically. This means cast iron makes a great material for stir frying as well as deep frying pots. For our review of the griddle here; it means that when we pour cold pancake mix onto this griddle; the surface will not drop in temp dramatically; yielding you perfectly uniform pancakes. If you go to someone's house and they make you pancakes; and the center is very dark and the edges are very light; chances are they used a cheap pan. (My guess; an aluminum bottom with telfon top) This is because as the batter mix is poured into the pan; the pan ""was"" hot; when the batter touched; the pan dumped all its heat into the initial point of contact with the batter (in this case, batter runs outwards in a concentric circle) so by the time the batter spreads; the pan is already cold, so the flame will attempt to bring the pan back to temp; and thus burning the part that was hot already (the center) and leaving the edges undercooked. This is also why people think pancakes at pancake houses taste better than homemade; because they use a big griddle at the restaurant. Well, now you can do the same.  The other item two items that cast iron offers are something that has come in more of the limelight in the last few years than a few decades ago; and that's health. Cast Iron is made of 100% iron; and so if you have something leech into your food; it would be iron; an essential mineral. Granted it might color your food taste; as well as the actual color; but it is essentially healthy for you. The other item cast iron provides for you is the knowledge that it's a safe product. Compare that with some of the non-stick pans that will give you cancer when you eat it (hey buddy; those aren't pepper flakes, they are scraped up teflon!!) Or aluminum pots and pans; that will give you Alzheimer. No thank you!  5) Low and Slow  Because this griddle is round; and most heating (be it gas or electric) is round; you get very uniform heating. Couple that with the fact that cast iron is fairly uniform heating itself; and this makes for a good pan to heat something that you need heated evenly. I don't own a toaster; why would you if this makes toast that comes out much more uniform; and tastes 10x better? In most toasters; there are strips of wires (heating elements) that run horizontally. They get red hot; and that's is how your toast is toasted. You can see evidence of this by the burn streaks on your toast. When you heat your bread on this griddle however, you have uniform surface contact (assuming your bread is sliced uniformally) and thus you get very good crunch and very even crunch. Couple that with the fact that the bread is being heated on the entire surface all at once; instead of by a few red hot coils; and your toast actually toasts faster on this than in a toaster, and more uniform and more delicious. Put a little butter on it and sprinkle a little bit of garlic powder (or fresh garlic!) and you get garlic bread! Delicious!  This is also perfect for tortillas; which I do every morning. We usually freeze our tortillas; and so coupled with a meat press; I take a frozen tortilla out; put it on this griddle; and press it flat with the lodge meat press. I flip it over in a minute; and give it another minute; put some cheeze on it; a little avocado and whatever leftover meat from dinner; and presto! Taco breakfasts.  With the great even cooking surface; my wife likes to make egg tortillas; crack an egg and beat it; then pour into the skillet and then cover it with a piece of tortilla. The egg will stick to the tortilla and not the griddle! Flip it over; let it cook alittle bit; roll it up; breakfast egg rollers.  Reheating pizza is something I do often on this; I put the pizza on and then put a small piece of aluminum foil over it; have it on low heat; and let it heat low and slow. I cook hamburgers patties on this; and they always come out perfect.  Because of the shallow edges; it's not a good idea to cook anything that has a lot of ""juiciness"" to it; but anything bread related; this is it! Reheating bread is a cinch; as is heating sandwiches.  6) Accessories  I will recommend a few accessories that pairs quite well with this item. The first recommendation is the lodge meat press (LGP3). Like I said above; I use this to press everything from tortillas to hamburger patties. If you heat it first on the open stove top; you can then cook both sides together at once; like a panini without the grill marks. The second recommendation is a glass lid. I have 6 pots that are between 10.25~10.5"" in diameter. I found a very nice glass lid at the thrift store for $1. I changed the knob on it from the plastic to a metal one. This lid fits on all 6 of my pots! The glass allows you to look into the food without lifting the lid, while the lid is quite useful on the 10.25"" skillet; I use the lid on this griddle mainly to prevent slashes. My wife uses it when she reheats bread so the bread doesn't dry out so quickly. Remember, while you are heating up the griddle or skillet and you know you will be using the lid; then heat up the lid as well. My third recommendation is the silicone hot handle holders. They help.  7) Full Circle ~ Let us begin at the beginning  So we are back full circle; let me encourage you to buy this piece of kitchen equipment. The price and value in unbeatable, When you first buy this; and ONLY when it's new; I do encourage you to use hot soapy water and a stiff nylon brush to clean the pan thoroughly. It comes out of the factory with a thin film of wax so it doesn't rust, and so that requires a bit of soapy water to get off. Then go ahead and google and follow directions on how to season your pan properly; and season it; and you are ready for action! Most recommend your first official item cooked on this be bacon; and I agree! I do want to stress though what I said above; Ghee; Lard, or Avocado Oil as the three cooking oils of choice. Most vegetable based ones have a low flash point; meaning you will easily burn your oil which becomes carcinogenic, or else they will add a funky taste to your food. I have quite a few pieces of Lodge cookware and I fully intend to Will them to my grandkids. They are beautiful; durable, cooks beautifully; browns beautifully; makes food tastes much better, and the cost is near nothing for what it provides for you and your family. You owe it to yourself and your loved one; and your health and your loved one's health to buy one. If you do what I tell you to do above; you will have the nicest; most non-stick griddle in the world.  8) Bonus: How to save a rusty pan  So a lot of you for some reason have decided to put this in the item in the dishwasher... and now it's super rusty.. never fear, I'm here! How to save your rusty griddle. Go to Walmart; and buy a 2-Liter bottle of regular Coke. (not the sugar free or diet one; regular Coke). Plug your sink up; put the griddle in it; and pour and cover with coke. Set your timer for 5 minutes if it's kind of rusty; and 10 minutes if it's super rusty. When the timer beeps; grab your roll of aluminum foil; about 1 square foot. Now ball it up into a ball. Take your griddle out of the coke solution; 90% of the rust should be gone already. Dab and scrub with the aluminum foil until no more rust. Drain the sink; get the hot water running; and scrub with the stuff nylon brush under hot running water. Congrats, you now have a new griddle! Now season it as you would; and go about your life.  9) Super Bonus: When to clean your pan  There are 3 points in time when you should clean the pan:  1) Right after you cook; while the griddle is ridiculously hot. The food has not stuck onto the pan; and so it's a great time to clean. But ONLY if there is no food left on it.  2) If there are bits of food on the pan, I'd actually wait until the food is almost cool on the pan to scrape and wash the pan. The reason is this: Remember cast iron is low thermal conductivity? Well, when the food is stuck on there; ironically the cast iron continues to slowly cook the food even after you've turned off the heat. Because you aren't adding more heat; the air temp is now cooler than the temp of the pan; so as the moisture slowly leaves the food item because the cast iron is still heating it; the food will CURL UPWARDS because the air is cooler than the pan and that will be the direction of the shrinkage; as well as the pan is slowly burning the food's bottom. So when the food is almost cold; you will find that it isn't stuck so badly as it initially was; because it's dried a bit and now might ""flake"" a bit when you pick at it, so a hard plastic pan scraper will easily scrape it off. Scrape the large chunks off with the scraper; and then again; back to the stiff nylon brush under hot water.  3) The only time cast iron is super difficult to clean is if there was burn sugar involved. Three ways to attack this: while the griddle is hot; pour some warm water (not cold, you will crack the griddle) on it; let it bubble; and then scrape right away. Second way is to reheat the griddle; let it start almost burning again; and pour some warm water on it; let it bubble for a bit; and then scrape it right away. The Third method is a strange two-stage method. Scrub with a stiff nylon brush; under the hottest water you can. If the sugary parts scrape off; great! If not; don't fret. Stop scrubbing; and dry it with a paper towel. The pan should be warm to the touch still. Leave it on the stove top to cool off overnight; do not put it into a cupboard. The next morning; take a dry pot scraper; and scrape it. The sugary parts will flake and come off. When the pan was warm, it was again slowly drying out the sugars stuck on it. As the sugar dried; it hardened and so next morning; you can ""crack"" the sugar and remove it easily.  10) Notes, hints, and personals  I recall staying at a relative's house one time; and my wife usually has eggs for breakfast. So the only pan we could find was one of the wunderbrick non-sticks; and so she cooked an egg with it. It tasted so bad that she threw it out. While ingredients make obviously a big difference; a less obvious one is the pots and pans used to cook it. The ability to go from stove to oven without transferring the vessel used; is not to be looked upon lightly. The fact that it will outlast most other pots and pans should not be looked upon lightly either. Our health depends our ability to cook healthy foods and not eating out; and the right pots and pans is a big part of that. If it's difficult to use or produces inferior results; then you will not use it. We have become a people of instant gratification; instant this; instant that. But I have yet to eat at any restaurant; food equal to that which I cook at home. I have control over every aspect from procurement of ingredients to pots and pans used. A lot of people buy cookware because it looks pretty; that is their prerogative but the priority really should be, what does it do for your health? A piece of cookware that is pretty AND functional is great; but if not; I'll settle for functional over pretty any day. What's the point of having a pan that's pretty but burns all your food? What's the point of a pot that is easy clean up but gives you cancer?  Like I noted in the beginning; this was not a review; but a treatise. What we are talking about essentially isn't a piece of cookware; we are talking about quality of life. And a good quality of life begins with health. And health begins with healthy cooking. And healthy cooking begins with a piece of cookware that you are willing to use. One that will provide for you and your family delicious food day after day; week after week; month after month; year after year, generation after generation. I rarely give a product such a glowing endorsement; I have not been paid by anybody; and I bought mine with my hard earned money because I wanted the best for my family. Tortillas and farm fresh eggs for breakfast; this is the cookware we wake up to every morning. It has been an essential part of our lives and I couldn't imagine for the price of a few beers; a better way to build great health for you and your family."
"I bought this pan after reading a lot of reviews. Especially I read a lot of 1, 2 3 star reviews. I believed that most of these negative reviews are because of not proper use or impatience. Remember, cast iron skillets are tricky, They work better than most of the nonstick, provided they are seasoned well, and proper use. I have had success in using larger Lodge Cast iron skillets, so thought I'll give it a try.  I mainly bought this to prepare my all time favorite , nice crispier awesome dosas (Indian rice crepes). It was a hit in the first try itself. If you have difficulties like sticking, burning etc, be patient. Season it well by using multiple times, or baking it couple of times after oiling the skillet. I am using it almost every day to prepare my favorite breakfast. If you have any questions, how to seaon, sticking issues etc, please post it in the comment, I'll make sure to answer. I want to help you to enjoy this pan and the dosa :)  Update: I have been using this skillet for more than two years now. We use it almost every day. Can't complain, best $12 investment ever."
"This might be my all time favorite cast iron pan. I use this at least once a day at least 6 days a weaken average. Its my favorite for pancakes and fire perfectly on the largest burner on my glass top electric GE profile stove. I can very comfortably fit 3 pancakes using the 1/4-1/3 cup to measure the batter, and 4-5 fried eggs at a time with room to spare. *** the picture below shows what 6 scrambled eggs look like in the pan  For anyone NEW to cast iron, I would highly suggest visiting theculinaryfanatic dot com website as a one stop shop for pretty much all things cast iron. Jeffrey B Rogers does a great job making info straight forward, and posting lots of videos to walk his audience through everything from restoration, cleaning, seasoning, and maintaining cast iron. There is also a ""Cast Iron Cooking"" facebook group with almost 300k members which is really helpful. Just beware that the group's ""pinned post"", though DENSE with helpful info, is very long and can be overwhelming for those new to cast iron. The group administrators also have a habit of responding to most newcomers with ""read the FAQ""/""that can be found in the FAQ"", even if the post asks for some more in depth or subjective info or opinions than is offered in the pinned post. In their defense its huge group to manage. Either way the FB group is also an asset if you are new cast iron."
"I was anemic and had to use cast iron for first time. I was little reluctant as I thought it's gonna be hard as these are not non-stick. To my surprise, never once it got stuck provided, the girdle is properly seasoned. Now I can make paper thin dosas (South Indian crepes) and never have to worry about things getting stuck. Very happy with the purchase! Oh, I forgot! My iron levels are back to normal just after 2 months of using cast iron pots and pans."

"My ""crepe"" maker/baker came in yesterday and I was so excited to try it out for crepes. I grew up using Lodge cookware, but when the kids became teens with so many friends over all the time, I gave up because I couldn't throw them in the dishwasher. I got home with my new griddle and then hesitated because I wanted to make a crepe cake first, I finally settled to just try a few crepes since I had never made any and only eaten once. I had already gone through with washing and doing a little extra seasoning since most need more seasoning than when they arrive. I oiled with Wesson vegetable oil and put on low heat for a few minutes, let it cool, then wiped it down & then did a repeat about 3 times. I then thought I'd go ahead and see how it would work since they were trial and error anyway. I put my first one in and prayed for a non-stick.. WOW!! It worked!! I ended up practicing an about 6 or 7 with chocolate and did not have to use any more oil while cooking. That is the first time for that to ever happen with me!! Needless to say, I love my new Lodge ""crepe pan"", since that is all or nearly all that I will use this one for. Bread type items. I could not be happier with it's first performance! Lodge will last you past a lifetime if you take care of it. I am using the skillets and bakers that I grew up on and we'll say that they are over 50 years old. The only issue I've ever seen with the cookware in this time, was over 25 years ago when the outside bottom and lower edges became severely caked on, so bad that the name was barely readable. It was winter and we had a wood heater. My mother decided to throw one on the coals as they were getting low. A little later she pulls them out and they were burnt clean! Too bad we had to re-season, but we did not have to buy more cookware. Try that with other cookware and see what you end up with! :) You can't go wrong with these with the exception of acidic foods. NEVER put acidic in them until they have been well seasoned for a while and you have a thick build up of coating to protect. That is the only downside of these really, and it is not necessary to wash each time, cooking bread items, wipe crumbs and store. Unless you should burn or stick, then wash it."
"I bought it because of the reviews 😒 I thought I can't go wrong with over 4.5 stars and over 4,000 reviews 🤔 When I first open the package I rinsed the pan with warm water before using it. Then heated up tortillas and realized they had turn black? But they weren't burn? Washed it after use with cold water regular dish soap and black started to rub off. I realized that the black on my tortillas was this material 😡 After washing the pan I left it on the table to dry to return it and couple hours later it turn ORANGE and left a spot on my table! Yes ORANGE! Orange spots! HORRIBLE PRODUCT! I hope non of these materials are harmful!"

"VERY heavy. Lots of TLC required. Versatile. Multi-generational. Reasonably priced. Lodge seasoned CI-made in USA.  First of all, for those of you who care about country of origin, rest assured that Lodge seasoned cast iron is made in the USA (the enameled Lodge cast iron however, is made in China).  Before I delve into the review of this LCI, let me just warn my readers that CI is rather heavy! If you have arthritis or a weak arm and had, you may want to consider a lighter-weight cookware.  Now on to the “meat” (pun intended) portions of this review…  Cast iron is a forgiving but high maintenance mistress! She will forgive almost anything (even allowing her to rust!!!), but she does require a little TLC before, during, and after each use. The TLC she needs is:  1. Before using: season CI 1) Cast iron must be seasoned before any use; luckily, Lodge double seasons its cast iron so that customers may use the product right out of the box, but if you need to re-season the cast iron product, follow these steps: i) Scrub CI well in hot soapy water. ii) Dry thoroughly. iii) Spread a thin layer of oil (I like avocado oil, but vegetable or canola will suffice) over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts). iv) Place CI upside down on a middle oven rack and turn on the oven and allow to heat to 550°. (PLEASE refrain from placing the CI into an already heated oven; the CI heat gradually in the oven as the oven works its way up to 550 degrees F) (1) ***NOTE: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). v) Place foil on a lower rack to catch drips. vi) Once the oven temperature reaches 550 degrees, “bake” the CI for 50-90 minutes. vii) Turn off the oven and allow the CI to cool inside the oven. ***Reminder: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550). 2. During usage: use a “fatty food” the first time you use the CI implement. a. Personally, I love any excuse to fry bacon, so I always “break-in” my CI with bacon slices; however, there are many amongst you who are unable to partake in bacon for religious, moral and ethical, or environmental reasons. For those amongst you who cannot use bacon, cook a food that requires deep frying. b. Pre-heat the CI before using (every single time) or your food will stick and crumble i. NOTE: Although I ALWAYS pre-heat my CI for cooking, I rarely do so for cake-baking; for cake-baking I used a very liberal amount of my home-made pan release “goo” to fully coat the pan, and I pour the cake batter right into the pan; works every time! 3. After using: wash and re-season (NO, not the detailed steps mentioned above) a. After using the CI, and while it is still hot, wash using scorching (wear heat resistant gloves as to not burn your hands) water and salt (refrain from using chemical cleaners) i. NEVER wash in a dishwasher (OMG) b. Dry completely and thoroughly c. Spread a thin layer of oil over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts) and place the CI on the stove top to heat for about 10 minutes d. Store CI in a moisture free environment i. NEVER store food in CI ii. NEVER store CI in fridge or freezer  So that is the TLC required for a CI pan or pot, but there are still several things to keep in mind:  A. NOT everything should be cooked in cast iron! (1) Avoid cooking acidic foods in CI (yes, it is okay to finish the dish with a small squeeze of lemon (not when skillet is hot) or a few drops of vinegar, it is okay to add tomatoes and tomato paste to the dish you are cooking, but it is NEVER okay to stew tomato prolonged periods, deglaze with vinegar, or lemon juice to foods while they were still hot on the skillet) (2) Avoid (at least in the beginning when your cast iron is still getting TLC) sticky foods (fried eggs, omelets, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fried rice, crepes, etc.) as they will definitely stick to your CI; this is not to say that you will not eventually be able to fry eggs or make crepes on your CI, I do all the time, but you will need to have reused and reasoned you CI many times before it becomes fully non-stick. (3) Avoid cooking delicate fish (flounder, tilapia, etc.) In CI because the delicate fish will not tolerate the heat retained by the CI (an asset when searing steak) and will fall apart when flipped. (4) Avoid (particularly before your CI becomes super well-seasoned) using the same pan for savory and sweet as the CI does retain flavors; in other words, using the CI to bake a vanilla cake immediately the day after using it to make garlic chicken may make your vanilla a tad too garlicky! (5) Avoid using CI to cook foods that require lengthy periods of simmering, boiling, or steaming as the lengthy simmering, boiling, or steaming will strip your CI of its hard-earned seasoning.  Are you still reading? If after reading the previous portions of this review, you are concerned about the TLC necessary to maintain CI, then I really recommend you consider other cookware options. (Caphlan non-stick is a viable alternative); if on the other hand, you are still reading, then you are not dissuaded from investing in CI cookware, and I am glad of that!  There are numerous benefits to cooking and baking in CI: 1) Cast iron is extremely sturdy and is very difficult to ruin. (If you do ruin a CI pan, you can restore and reclaim it!). 2) Cast iron heats up evenly and retains heat incredibly well, which makes CI excellent for searing meat, baking corn bread, making pies, baking crusty bread, etc., and for keeping food warm as you serve it! 3) Cast iron is healthy; yes, that is true! During the cooking process a trace amount of iron is absorbed into the foods, and when the foods are consumed by you, you are getting some iron into your system (a healthy by-product of CI cooking). 4) Cast iron is quite versatile. You may use CI for almost everything (you make slow cook a lamb leg to perfect or make a three-layer birthday cake for your daughter in CI). Additionally, CI goes from cupboard, to stove-top, to oven, to camp-fire, and to dinner table! Talk about versatility! 5) Cast iron is of heirloom status; it lasts for generations! I personally have a huge collection, and I plan to bequest my CI to my daughter (it shall be written in my will-not kidding).  So, to re-cap: CI is a rather heavy type of cookware that offers great versatility, heats evenly, retains heat well, requires pre-seasoning and re-seasoning, and is multi-generational. And, of course, Lodge is an excellent CI brand. Lodge was founded in 1896 and is one of the very few remaining companies that still produce seasoned CI in the US (in the Lodge foundries in Tennessee). Lodge products are sturdy, versatile, heirloom-quality, and of course reasonably priced (as compared to the more expensive companies).  I have been using CI (especially Lodge) for two and one-half decades (yes, ¼ of a century) now, and I will NEVER use anything else! A purchase of Lodge CI cookware and bakeware is a very sound investment indeed!  **If you found this review of use, please “like” using the thumbs-up button below.

"When my old Wearever non-stick griddle (made in the USA, probably 30 years old) got too old, scratched and unreliable, I came to Amazon to get a replacement.  What I was met with for a griddle pan of the same size and construction led me to a dilemma: do I purchase a pan that will warp, heat unevenly and eventually end up in a garbage dump after only a few years? And do I really want to buy products that are made in China if I have an alternative?  All of these factors led me to the Lodge cast iron griddle. I have multiple other Lodge cast iron pans (yes, I realized too late in life their versatility, reliability and ease of use). Not wanting to buy what I call ""a piece of junk,"" I chose this griddle.  Bingo! It performs exactly as I hoped. I know how to care for cast iron cookware, so that was a snap for me. Heat is even, results are excellent. And this is made in the USA! A no-brainer for me.  I couldn't be happier - and if you're looking for a pan that will last, perform precisely as intended and be versatile enough to use on any heating surface (including your outdoor grill), this is it. Look no further."
"This is actually now the only Lodge pan that I own anymore. I've gone to antique ones that are much smoother, lighter, and in my opinion, better made. After 25 years of cooking with iron, I've become fairly particular when it comes to my cookware.  The reason that I've hung with this one over some of the antique griddles is simply that this one can't be beat. You don't move a griddle around when cooking with it so being heavier isn't a hindrance there. And because I'm often multitasking, I kind of like the idea that I don't have to hold the handle because it doesn't budge. It just sits there and does the things it's supposed to do.  Lodge comes with a seasoning on it and it's not too bad, but I can't leave well enough alone and have to bump things to my standards. That's why I have added 3 very thin coats of flaxseed oil to it and cooked each one at 490 degrees F for an hour. They tell you to reseason or add seasoning using vegetable oil, but don't do it. Your experience with your pan will be far less than satisfactory. If you don't have flaxseed oil, a bit of lard is a reasonable alternative. Both oils will heat up and harden to create a better finish than comes on it from the factory.  Maybe it's that or maybe just that I have learned how to cook with these things that allows me to avoid some of the other complaints that people have about things, that food can stick. I see people complain about pancakes, cheese, and particularly eggs, that these things become a bear. In my early days of cooking, I also encountered some of the same issues so I understand the frustration. But it just doesn't have to be, even with this rather rough surface Lodge pan. When I make eggs or pancakes, I literally just tilt the pan and slide them off onto the plate. In fact it is so slick that folding or turning eggs can be a little tricky because the surface is so slippery and they slide all around.  If you want to know the secret, keep reading.  First, understand that cooking is chemistry and physics at work. You don't have to understand the technical aspects of those principles to cook, but a few techniques based on those principles will come in handy. I won't go into the hows and whys, but try these ideas to get the best results:  1) Before you start, oil the surface of your pan with regular cooking oil (corn, veg, soy, canola, or whatever). Get it wet, but don't have puddles of oil to soak into your food. I put a few drops inside the pan, wipe it around with a paper towel, and remove all the excess oil.  2) Your pan needs to be hot before putting food on it. Not highest temperature red hot, but hot. Medium to medium high should be the proper setting. If the pan is too cold, food sticks. If the pan is too hot, it probably isn't even temperature all the way through and it will start to burn oil and food before stuff is cooked. This isn't your average teflon pan that you can heat up in 60-90 seconds. You should likely have 3-4 minutes before the pan is ready. If the pan is on medium and you start to see a whiff of smoke, your pan is hot enough.  3) Now pull out the butter - yes, butter! Your pan should be hot enough to make the butter melt and boil quickly, but not burn it. Apply butter quickly everywhere food will be cooking. By using two different oils, you get a separation that forms a barrier that stops food from sticking. When it comes to things like eggs, I also add a little sea salt to the pan at this time to season the bottom of the eggs.  4) Pour your batter or eggs onto the pan and LEAVE it alone. If you start stirring, you just stir your cooking oils up into the food instead of letting it stay on the pan where it belongs. You also prevent food from browning, which is a necessary step in the cooking process. Pancakes should be flipped just once, so wait until the edges are dry and the center is bubbly, then flip. Once eggs start to set, lift up the edges and allow the remaining liquid egg to drain down to the pan surface. Add any other ingredients you want to the eggs at this time, season, and then start folding the eggs as you would fold a blanket. As your food is finished, simply lift the pan and slide the food off onto the plate. Yes, it really is just that easy. Let the pan and the food do all the work, and save yourself a lot of clean up time. If you are doing a second batch, just add a bit more butter immediately and start the process all over.  Cleaning your Lodge pan  For the most part, you don't need to do much cleaning. After you get done cooking, run the pan under just a bit of hot water. That will steam it very quickly and if there is any food on the pan, most of it will come off simply with that. Just take a wet cloth and wipe the entire surface, and you are almost done. Don't use soap unless you have to. A bit of soap every once in awhile won't hurt your pan, but regularly using it can dry out the seasoning.  Fears about using soaps or not using them are both very over rated. People that fear food borne illness if everything they touch isn't washed with soap have fallen victim to soap marketing propaganda. The fact is that soaps are really only effective at removing grease, not food. Even if a bit of food were to stay on your pan, it won't hurt. It is fully cooked food that has completely dried out before the pan is used again (thus any food bacteria that could have been a problem has died), and you are heating your pan up again which again insures no bacteria. You eat dried foods all the time and food particles are still on dishes that you eat off all the time, if not at home, then in any restaurant.  Conversely, people who are terrified of ruining their pans if they come into contact with soapy water, just don't understand cast iron chemistry.  Your pan can be quickly ruined if you use steel wool soap pads on them or if you constantly scrub them with degreasers, but these aren't generally the case. If you've fried up some particularly noxious foods such as something with a lot of food oil (fish for example), even a properly washed out pan can smell a bit. I happen to know that's not a problem for next time I cook with it, but it can put some people off. If using a few drops of soap makes your pan smell better or you feel better, by all means do it. It's not going to hurt a thing. What soaps will do is dry out the inside of the pan and require that you use more oil as a final finish.  Be sure that you complete the next couple of steps to finalize the pan cleaning process. Wet pans rust, even if you dry them with a towel. I usually just toss them on the burner for a few minutes to dry out any non-visible water. Or if the oven is still hot, I may just toss them in there. Once warm, now take a paper towel and just wipe a few drops of oil on the surface. If you live in a dry climate, this may not be necessary. But for most of us, we don't want humidity doing a number on the pans, particularly if they won't be used for a couple of days.  Some folks recommend putting a sheet of paper towel between stacked iron pans. I don't think it's necessary, but it won't hurt either. Most stacked pans could use a little protection from other pans rubbing up against the cooking surface. By using the flaxseed oil process, my pans have a hard enough finish that this isn't a problem."
"Great for the price. I have been using cast iron pans for 25 plus years my mother had cast iron growing up and when I moved out I purchased a set. For Christmas I bought 2 of these for each of my children because they are Non-Toxic and you never have to replace them. They are pre seasoned but I do recommended seasoning them again before using them. This is very easy to do just cook up some bacon strain it and coat your pan both inside and out. Place it in the oven at 375 degrees for 1 hour. After that they are good to go. After using them they can be washed with regular dish soap and a sponge but you need to dry them immediately and then oil them with Olive oil or cooking oil right away. After drying warm them up so that the pores will open up and the oil will seal them up. If you burn something just simply put water in the pan and boil it until whatever is in the pan is soft and can be scraped of with a spatula. Then wash, dry and re-oil each time you use the pan. DO NOT Scrub them with anything abrasive or you will strip the coating off the pan. Or let them sit in water, doing this could result in rust. If this happen you will need to use vinegar and baking soda to get the rust out of the pan and you will then need to re-season the pan a couple of times again before using just google how to do it. Cast iron will last forever and can be past down to your children and grandchildren."
"I purchased this for my daughter, she makes pancakes EVERY morning. We have gone through several pans in the past searching for the perfect match and we finally found it.  This is the first cast-iron kitchen product that I've ever owned, and now I know why many people swear by them. This pan gets HOT and retains the heat much longer than any other type of metal - making it perfect for cooking pancake after pancake. It is also the perfect size for pancakes and is great for cooking eggs!  The best part about this pan - there is virtually zero clean up. Just wipe it down with a clean moist towel and that's it! Heavy washing with soap and water is not recommended (the heat cooks mostly everything off).  PRO TIPS:  Low heat is key with cast iron. Since it retains heat for so long, low consistent heat produces the best result (otherwise food will burn quickly).  As mentioned earlier, this thing gets hot, so let it cool for a while before touching the handle or cleaning.  Try to avoid using ingredients with strong spices or flavors. Everything ""cooks into"" cast iron and ""seasons"" the metal. Strong spices and flavors could carry over into future meals (so keep it simple)."
"Non stick pans starts to disintegrate after a few months and i have heard that they get into the food we cook with the non stick. Cast Iron is healthier and better option and easy to use. Just that you have season it a bit every wash. Once seasoned it just works the same way as a non stick pan. I use it to for bread, dosa, roti, omelet, tofu etc and its easy to use. You may have to use the Griddle smartly depending on the flame or coil, heat doesnot evenly spread. NOTE: You will need the handle, a wooden handle preferably as it gets really hot and silicone handles arent that good in 'absorbing' heat, they still may burn your skin."
"Dec. 2021 Had this pan nearly two years now. It's one of my favorites. Those who had issues with it rusting or sticking etc you need to really learn how to use cast iron... Never high heat, give it time to warm up, and follow the seasoning process below. I always cook with a high temp oil like avocado, never olive or veggie oil. Clean with a chain mail scrubber if needed and cast iron soap. Towel dry and dry in the oven at 400 degrees, not on your table, a coat of flax oil and let it set. New pictures of an omelette I'm made for lunch still fantastic. This is a fantastic pan especially at this price point.  Jan 2020 I have some vintage Wagner pans and this one.  It's pre seasoned but... You should season it. The secret weapon for a hard nonstick surface is flax seed oil and flaxseed oil only. It's a drying oil. Take your griddle, little soap and water than dry it and put it on the stove and crank the heat. Get a kitchen towel, put flax oil in a bowl and lightly dip the cloth. Wipe the pan with very thin coat. Too much will make it sticky so wipe off excess with a dry part of the cloth. Once that oil dries up, smokes off and is no longer shiny give it another coat. Pre heat your oven for 250 degrees F. Repeat this like 12 times (make sure you have fans on). This should use up your oil. On the last run wipe it down and put it in upside down in your oven at 350 for one hour. Always use a good polymerizing oil like canola oil, avocado etc when cooking. I like hardwood utensils to protect the finish. And preheat your pan. Most of the time you just need to wipe it clean with your oil rag and let it sit on the stove when your done cooking letting the residual heat bake on that oil. IF you get bits stuck a metal scrubber and a bit of soap followed by a reseasoning step or two keeps you good. A picture is worth a thousand words. Fried eggs, just a spritz of canola oil spary."
"I purchased this for my son cuz he didn't want to give me back mine hahaha. I made a deal that he can have it when I am gone. If you like tacos which who doesn't, right? You will absolutely LOVE this COMAL! Yes, I called it a COMAL cuz I'm Hispanic and that's what IT IS a COMAL!! It's great for heating up your tortillas, corn or flour, and for those non Hispanics I guess pancakes??? I don't know what other uses this is for other than tortillas and pollo a la plancha or camaron or carne a la plancha - DELICIOUS!! Translation: Grilled chicken, shrimp or steak grilled. Since all this Covid -19 started, I upped my tortilla making skills cuz I was outta practice and now my son can warm up his Momma's homemade tortillas when I send him some 😘. Now, when we have Taco Tuesdays, it's at my son's place cuz he has a comal and makes tacos 🥟🥟 that are the bomb!!"
"This griddle was very inexpensive. It's made in the USA, something I try to consider. It works great on my convection cook top. I was using the ""non-stick"" pans. After a very short time I had to add some cooking oil. The food cooked was tasking a little strange to me. The cast iron skillet works well with a little coconut spray (the same I had to use with the non-stick pans). The food just tastes better. I know I'm not eating the non-stick coating. Works great. I won't go back to the non-stick plans again. Great product, thanks' Kentucky! UPDATE: I've been using this pan pretty much every day. Here's a picture after many months of use. It's so much better than my non-stick pans that scratch so easily. Great product. Easy clean-up and I use metal spatulas instead of the plastic ones. This will literally last for many years."
"I was looking for a pan specifically for making crepes and this lodge skillet came up among the results. I own a big skillet that gets little use and rusts, so I was leery about cast iron. The reviews I read were encouraging and the price is right so I pulled the trigger. It turned out to be a GREAT decision. The seasoning that it came with out of the box was good to make a couple batches of crepes without any sticking issues. I seasoned it a few days later with some cooking oil and oven time and voila, it's performing like a champ. Cooking with it regularly will also help develop that seasoning that works just like Teflon. Caveats: you've gotta treat this thing right. Once you wash it, dry it immediately with a hand towel or on the stove in low heat. Just a little prevention and tlc and this bulletproof skillet will still be used by your grandchildren. Buy it!"

"Lodge cast iron skillet I’ve been using the skillet for two weeks now and it’s been a pleasant experience. You can’t go wrong with the cast iron. You can cook anything on it, on any kind of surface, use any kind of utensils, even put it in the oven or grill (perfect for the homemade pizza!!!) It’s not like Teflon, it is going to stick if don’t manage the heat well, so if you burn the food it’ll stick, but if you’re controlling the heat - it’ll perform incredibly! Nothing beats the look, smell, taste, and simply authenticity of food made using cast iron. If you love cooking and know the nuances - this is a treasure you will enjoy every time! But if you are a regular user, you’ll definitely have some favorites to cook on your cast iron too. Cast iron requires a bit more maintenance then Teflon: you don’t wash it in a dishwasher, sometimes you need to scrub it, and after scrubbing it might get rusty, but it’s a normal thing for the cast iron and is very easily fixable - you can find Lodge’s official video on YouTube how to do it, super simple and quick, and your skillet is like new again (you don’t need any special stuff for it, just oil and oven). To prevent it from rusting, just do the seasoning right after scrubbing. Considering all the pros you get with this kitchen staple, maintenance can be an enjoyable experience too;) Pay attention to the size and deepness to see if it fits your needs. Always use the mitten with it, because the handle gets hot. Absolutely worth the price, skillet that’s going to serve you for the rest of your life, and next generations:)! Highly recommend!"
"So, I had a craving for Crepes Suzette and hit the YT to find a recipe. Most videos showed a crepe pan and they are cheap enough but unfortunately they are cheaply made and don't last- especially with a nonstick coating. I am the kind of cook that values quality and shies away from specialty products or gadgets. That and after a few crepe sessions, how many times would I use a crepe pan? Or the wood spatula?  I know I will always pull out a piece of cast iron cookware, either char veggies and peppers, cook a hearty stew, or to make an English breakfast and I own only Lodge cast iron products. This Lodge Griddle could be used for mini pizzas, charring, French toast, pancakes, and CREPES!  This griddle comes preseasoned but I washed it and oiled it before use. My first attempt at crepes was less than perfect though and I narrowed my technique down to two flaws: one I didn't let the batter rest for one hour and two, I didn't apply enough batter to completely cover the griddle. They fell apart and were stringy, like when you have a dribble of batter and it leaves that crusty trail? That was on the bottom 1/4 of the pan because I didn't have enough batter to cover the pan.  The next batch was improved but with the same recipe; it was allowed to rest and I used a soup ladle-full of batter and turned the pan quickly. This batch turned out fantastic! I used a large metal Wilton spreading knife to flip the crepes. The pan heated evenly, the crepes released effortlessly, and they were paper thin. I mean, they were so thin a piece of tissue paper called them thin! If the crepes were a little durable, I'd replace my windows with them. Thin. If Lady GooGoo knew how thin these crepes were, she'd wear them as an outfit. Thin.  Anyway, the two down sides, you can guess both if you own cast iron. First, this pan is heavy. Not so heavy that you couldn't handle it, twist it to distribute the batter, or to flip your items, but heavy enough to burn a few extra calories to have an extra serving of whatever you're cooking. Be extremely careful when flipping your items over and onto a glass plate. I clinked the two a couple of times but you know Corelle, that stuff is tough! You might not be so lucky if the griddle slips. Be careful.  The other one, a little more serious, the handle does get hot. I typically use a kitchen towel on the fly but I used my lodge frying pan last week so I had my red handle cover handy- so I used it. DO not try to grab this handle without protection. If you do, you won't make that mistake again.  Now a couple of tips, based on the reviews I have read about this pan. Rust. Rust doesn't ruin this pan. Look up how to clean and season cast iron. Food sticks. Season your pan and oil accordingly before applying food. Sometime I add oil, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I add water, yes water. This all comes back to cooking though. If you get this griddle because it is a great price but don't know how to use it, that's not cast iron's fault. It's the cook. Cast iron works! Rough edges or finish. You can use a file, sandpaper, or a grinder to knock of rough spots. Don't go nuts and more often than not- just leave it alone unless it becomes a health hazard. I have only had to do this once and I have two dutch ovens, a griddle plate for our grille, three frying pans, lids for everything, a few cornbread molds, and our newest edition this griddle pan. If you are uncomfortable with any potential warranty canceling modifications, get another one through Amazon exchange, or contact Lodge. I bet both will be happy to help. Bottom line, don't get discouraged and give this griddle pan a try.  Finally, enclosed you will find a few pictures of this pan and its products and the end result, Crepes Flambe. I always thought Crepes Suzette was set alight but not true! A video by Chef Stéphane of the French Cooking Academy showed what true Crepes Suzette were- but personally, I want fire! Anyway, after the crepes were made, I used a taller pan for the orange sauce and final preparation because to use the low walled griddle would be extremely dangerous and irresponsible.  Good luck, happy cooking, and get this griddle pan!"
"Induction is outstanding for hitting a consistent temperature and cast iron is perfect for having enough mass to hold that temperature even if you place something cold in the pan. I use the 10.5 inch round pan for items that don't typically ""sizzle"" since the low sidewall doesn't contain the flying oil or butter. Flipping is a breeze since you can get your spatula low and under the food.  Induction users should be aware that cast iron takes longer to change temperature than other pans that you may be used to. Set your fixed temperature, provide sufficient time for the pan to warm up, and enjoy even heat on your cast iron pan. Once you get the hang of it you'll have the perfect pancakes, grilled cheese, etc. I also use a silicone handle grip which works well with the heat settings that I typically use with the 10.5 low profile pan.  Avoid letting your cast iron pan sit in water and dry it off soon after washing. If you take care of this pan it should last for years with no issue. If you do see rust you can re-season your pan fairly easily by following the instructions on the Lodge website. I learned the hard way but it really wasn't as hard as I had imagined to get it back to like-new condition."
"Listen, I love lodge cast irons. Why I went ahead and bought this one but as you can see from the picture - it looks used, it didn’t come with the label that typically goes around the handle, and the letters on the bottom are rusted. I’m not down with the used product that I bought as new. I’ll change my review if this is amended but for now I’m annoyed."
"Since I own roughly 40 pieces of cast iron cookware, many of which are antiques and highly valued, it's odd that this is by far my most used piece. I bought this 13 years ago in 2009 and it only gets better with age. I don't need another one, but just wanted to see how much they'd gone up with inflation over time and was shocked to see that this is still under $20 when I'd purchased it back then for $15.  I use this griddle at least once a day and often many times more. It's perfect for an omelet, pancakes, bacon, toast bread or to sear a piece of meat. Short of some unimaginable accident, it's likely my kids and grandkids will inherit it and it still won't look any older when they pass it along. I have pieces of iron cookware dating back to the mid-1800s and one used by General Grant's personal cook, and they are still great cookware."
"All by itself, this griddle is fantastic. It doesn't warp when it gets hot, unless you crank up the heat the first time...then you're on your own. It's mostly non-stick as long as you are careful with heat and use the right oil.  But you can make this griddle even better, if you have an orbital sander.  Years ago, the cooking surface of cast iron pans were machined almost smooth. But, as cast iron started to fall out of vogue, the Lodge company introduced a new kind of pan...pre-seasoned. The pre-seasoned pan saved Lodge from going under.  Lodge sprays a coating of oil on their pans, then sends them through the oven to finish the seasoning process. Unfortunately, with the old machined pans, the oil would run right off and result in an uneven seasoning. Not good!  So, Lodge--being the innovators they are--came up with a way to get the oil to stick long enough to get through the oven. Their solution? Make the cooking surface rough. Not super rough, but enough to hold the oil in place.  Run your finger along a new Lodge pan and an old machined pan. You can immediately tell the difference.  Good news, everyone! You can (mostly) get back to that machined finish if you're willing to invest just two hours of your time.  First, take your orbital sander and some 40 grit paper, and sand down the cooking surface. When it's relatively smooth (do not go for a mirror finish!), switch to 80 grit. After that, if you can still see swirls in the pan, use 120 grit. Nothing after that. GO SLOWLY so you don't gouge the pan with your sander, especially with the 40 grit discs. This should take 30-60 minutes.  Next, wash the pan really well with soapy water. Yes, you need to use soap to ensure all the metal filings are off the cooking surface. You don't want to eat them! Then, get your favorite seasoning oil (I use shortening) and apply a THIN layer of oil onto any part of the pan where the pre-seasoning was removed. Then into a 450 degree oven, upside down, for about an hour. Repeat this step as needed.  Your ""new"" pan will perform as well as any non-stick out there, including making eggs and pancakes.  One thing to remember, the slicker surface is more delicate than the pre-seasoned surface...just like the machined pans of old. You can almost get away with murder on a pre-seasonsed Lodge...they are very forgiving. The updated Lodge won't be. Just take your time and be careful, and your pan will perfom wonderfully for 100 years.  BTW, the griddle is the easiest pan on which to do this. The walls are shallow, and the pan isn't very expensive, so if you somehow ruin it (you won't), it's not that big of a loss. Really though, it's not that hard.  Enjoy!"
"Update love it. ! I bought this cast iron skillet to use for my portable new induction cooktop (which only works with cast iron or stainless steel) b/c I’m waiting forever for ele parts to repair my oven/stove top. At first it wasn't as smooth as my old cast iron pans, but that’s b/c it needed time and seasoning. So I made a point to season it several times. The more the better. I used to not like cast iron b/c of food sticking. But, just read seasoning directions that come with the pan. Now as long as I oil pan and heat it before I add food, then keep temperature from getting too hot, I have very little problem with sticking  No it’s not “no stick” but healthier and gives me great browning. It’s not hard to clean, using only hot water, no soap, and scrubber. Then I dry it with a little heat and oil. I use it many times a week."
Got these for my sour dough pancakes and they have been cooking beautifully! The key is to turn the oven burner on low and let it heat up for a good 5 minutes before adding the oil and the pancakes. I add about 2Tbsp of canola or vegetable oil to the skillet before adding the pancakes and the pancakes don’t absorb all of th oil but it does prevent any sticking whatsoever. I like a good metal spatula with this because a silicone spatula isn’t slim enough or an edge to get under the pancakes. Don’t use soap to clean. Just scrap any pancake remnants off (usually there aren’t any!) and rinse and dry. Then add a few drops to moisturize.
"I like the 10” cast iron griddle, convenient size, good quality cast iron, as are all 5 of the Lodge frying pans I own. Nicely seasoned, no sticking problems with eggs and only a very little with pancakes. Would have given it 5 stars, but feel the edges of the handle are not rounded enough for a pan this heavy (I will file the edges of the handle a little when time to re-season). Not a problem when cooking with the pan (using a hotpad to hold it), but during washing and handling, the “sharp” edge is noticeable to me.  Decide to update my review after using the griddle for some time. The ""sharp"" edge does not seem to be much of a problem. This griddle has become a ""first choice"" utensile for preparing many items in our kitchen, e.g., eggs, tortillas, toasted sandwiches, ect., beause low edge makes turning easier, and it is slightly lighter than our 10"" skillets. Very convenient item to use. The seasoning is holding up well, we are not particularly careful about utinsiles use on the surface and we clean the cooking surface with a stainless steel or copper scrubbing pad with no apparent harm to it."
"When the ceramic coating started chipping off my waffle maker, I was not happy. The only cookware I have that is long lasting is cast iron. But I can't find a castiron waffle maker from a source I trust buying.  I decided to start making crepes because I don't like the soggy floppiness of pancakes. But the non-stick electric crepe maker made me uncomfortable each time I took it out of the cupboard. I wanted to feel at ease with all my cookware, not just my cast iron, but that seemed very unlikely for making waffles.  I immediately washed the griddle with soap and water, rinsed thoroughly, and seasoned a couple times in my oven.  Before this griddle arrived, I researched a few recipes in preparation. So I made crepes for several days. Not a single crepe burned or stuck to the griddle. Every crepe slid off easily onto a waiting rack.  I have never made crepes on a griddle or skillet but it was easier than using the electric crepe maker. And I didn't have to shuffle zen garden tools around my small work area.  Making crepes wasn't my only interest for this new griddle. I have other Lodge cast iron, 12 at the time of this review. They are of a solid build and versatile.  Making crepes is just doing the same thing, same batter, same heat setting, same spatula again and again. You learn a lot more about your cooking abilities with using cast iron when you make different food.  No one wants leftover fried chicken or pizza that is soggy. Using this griddle as a sheet pan in the oven is perfect for reheating leftovers. Bits of cheese didn't stick when making grilled cheese. Peppers and onions can be sauteed quickly. Homemade bread rolls, biscuits, and dough wrapped sausages bake with an even crust color.  Using cast iron, you owe it to yourself to do some experimenting. Use stainless steel spatulas with your cast iron? Yes! If you are really heavy handed you might get a scratch or two. But repeatedly seasoning your griddle makes it so it's practically self-healing. Keep using the cast iron and those scratches disappear more quickly than you can guess - as you season. I cut food while still on the griddle regularly and I can't see a single scratch.  You can use a mild soap when cleaning the griddle. I usually only use soap before the first use. I have not had food stick to the point where I have to soak it in water. Run water, use a brush or scraper, and a little coarse if needed. Cleaning is done in about a minute, then dry and season. For me, doesn't matter if it's as soon as the griddle has cooled, or the next day. That's not heavy maintenance at all. Any one tells you cast iron is too much time and work to maintain is just lazy or not well informed.  The first Lodge cast iron I purchased for myself was a 12"" skillet and with each new Lodge, I am more than satisfied with the performance and excited to explore new recipes and make old recipes more fun. Yesterday I made giant 10 inch cookies with this griddle. Rumors that sugar ruins cast iron seasoning are false. I make cookies, brownies, cobblers, hand pies, cheesecakes, pound cakes, scones, etc. often because I have a passion for baking. My giant cookies released from the griddle after using an angled spatula in one spot. Cookie nearly popped up like a jack-in-the-box. Again, success and easy cleanup, much better than my old non-stick cookie sheets ever did.  Am I pleased with this griddle? Yes, absolutely! Would I recommend it for crepes, pancakes, reheating food, making giant cookies? Yes, certainly! I know this griddle is a Lodge and as always reliable cast iron. I also know that I am looking forward to learning to make the most of it and learn to make food I have not tried, like dosa, corn tortillas and whatever recipes others want to share."
"Overall, I really love Lodge products. I have such a huge collection of expensive All-Clad pots and pans and it makes me laugh to think that I prefer a $35 Lodge pan, griddle, sauce pan, etc., to my All-Clad that cost multiples more. Yes, you do have to care for your cast iron products but it is well worth what I don't even consider an inconvenience anymore to get the results of cast iron. One thing though, if you find you want to rapidly heat and then rapidly cool something, cast iron isn't really for you. It heats amazingly but it retains it's heat for a long time so you have to alter the way you cook with these products. I bought the griddle, oddly enough, as a tortilla warmer. I get that thing so hot it starts smoking and then I heat up tortillas on it and it's as close to eat a freshly made tortilla taste I can get making tacos in my Manhattan apartment. I love tacos and really anything taco related as a Texas transplant so this griddle pretty much almost never leaves my stovetop."
"This is a pancake, grilled cheese, Etc dream pan. Not a chicken fryer or made for lots of grease pan. I love to cook and Cast iron and Lodge makes a great product. Some of the older Cast iron is a lot smoother than the current production of Lodge or any other Cast iron product out there. This being a new product it has a rough finish but it doesn’t really affect the cooking in my opinion I have used it to cook pancakes, biscuits, and a few other smaller meals and it’s worked perfectly. I saw some reviews about the seasoning coming off and I really don’t understand that unless they’re cooking with too high temperature too fast. As other reviewer’s have stated if you put this on medium heat and allow it to come up to temperature rather than trying to crank the heat to high, You will have a much better result with your cooking. Hi heat is the only reason that I have ever had seasoning come off while cooking. If you need a nice shallow cast-iron pan but it does the job."
"This pan supposedly comes seasoned. But a little research said to add additional layers. Seasoning is easy. Just apply very light coating of oil (I used canola)... wipe it off as well as you can (I left too much on)... and bake face down at anywhere from 350-475 for 30 minutes to an hour. (There are a million opinions.) I used 450 for 30... re-oiled... another 30... and repeated 3 more times. I ultimately had a little stickiness which means I didn't wipe off enough oil. So I wiped it off... re-baked. Anyway, the first time I used it I didn't add enough oil. I wiped a little on the hot pan and thought that the seasoning was enough. It's not. You STILL need to oil the pan. The eggs stuck horribly. My first thought was, ""Wow... all that work and still a mess. Here'a another return!"" But I realized that I didn't add even the same amount of oil that I would my nonstick pan. So the next test I added a little spray oil and the smallest amount of butter (3 grams). Result? Beautifully non stick! Bottom-line... just season it right and add enough oil (to an already hot pan) when cooking. On another note, there's a YouTube video of a guy using a brand new, never used Lodge pan without doing his own seasoning. He had good results. But... apparently the more you use them, the better they get, so adding your own seasoning should make it even better. It's amazing how much better eggs taste on cast iron!"
"These pics were taken today- AFTER TWO MONTHS of daily use. My new pan barely gets a chance to cool off because I LOVE this griddle! It gets hot quickly; and it heats evenly. It also cleans well as long as you know NOT to remove the non-stick seasoning by scouring with steel wool or copper pads. Those are a definite NO-NO! I clean my cast iron with hot water and a PLASTIC dish brush, or a plastic dish scrubber. If you make bacon and eggs for breakfast this pan cleans up well with the wipe of a paper towel. It is best to leave a slight oily film which in turn becomes it's perpetual non-stick seasoning/coating. Since I have an electric stove, if I clean the pan with hot water- I turn the burner on high THEN I turn off the burner as I put the pan on the hot burner to dry. Steps like these will ensure that you have no issues with sticking or rust- EVER. I grew up with cast iron cookware, and I also have quite a bit of it. Cast iron pans like this can be passed down as heirlooms when treated with reasonable care. I am not being remunerated in any way for my review, yet I HIGHLY recommend this purchase."
"I've had this griddle pan for 6 months now. I will say it performs great. I use it mostly for pancakes and grilled cheese but I have used it for hamburgers, chicken, and fried eggs. The pan is obviously limited due to its dimensions so you really want to decide if you need this pan. I would say for pancakes it is much easier to use this then one with sides and the same goes for sandwiches. Having low sides is also the weakness of the griddle. You can't put much liquids in the griddle or anything that will splatter because having no sides means the splatter will go everywhere else. This isn't an issue let's say of you use this on the grill our camping but in the kitchen it may be a drawback but again this is a griddle. It's a very specific pan for specific uses and it excels in my opinion."
"I saw this pre-seasoned cast-iron and I saved it in one of my wishlists for a long time. Just recently, I decided to splurge and Lodge Logic was having a sale on Amazon so I bought it!  Pros: -evenly round with great heat distribution -it's already pre-seasoned so it's ready to use -very sturdy -easy to clean (just rinse with hot water) -basic recipes become extremely delicious recipes (homemade pizzas, pancakes, omelettes, homemade tortillas, roasted vegetables, and grilled cheese sandwiches, etc.) -Stylish and black  Cons: -while being sturdy, it's heavy  After going cast iron for my pizzas, there's no turning back. Picture attached. I also recommend purchasing their Silicone hot handle holder. It works great and it hugs the handle well so you don't burn your hands off.  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. I may be a beginner at cast irons, but having cooked for most of my life, this is so exceptional. I love it."
We bought the product as a convenient easy to lift cast iron flat griddle to make Indian dosas - rice-lentil pancakes. The weight of the pan is just enough to prevent the dosas from burning and provides an even brown finish that makes them look very delicious and appealing. The pan needs to be seasoned well before use but comes pre-seasoned when shipped. After each use we scrape off any food and wash with hot water and the seasoning seems to live on longer than using soap and chemicals - the temperature at which we cook is more than high enough for food safety. The product was shipped well and arrived without any damage. The price was also extremely attractive as Lodge offers pure cast iron products that compare favorable against the ceramic coated ones of a French company.
"The first one I got was defective. thanks, Amazon for an easy return. The second one is like any lodge pan, I seasoned it, and I have been using it daily... just the right size, not too heavy. easy to wash. and I love it.  update like the other review, the middle of the pan has particles coming off. after trying to. season it 5 times the middle of the pan cannot be seasoned... is thin... not sure if I should order again here or else where. lodge is good. but is it authentic? -------- The edge is not round. one corner is missing, but does not impact use... so I decided to keep it as is. Amazon has been excellent in allowing returns and exchanges, so this time I decided to just swallow the cost and keep it. I feel it is a lodge defect item got into the shipment, not Amazon's fault and return is too costly for the environment..."
"I am a fanatic of cast iron, I was raised with them in NW Montana a long time ago. This little gem is one of the most versatile items I have in my kitchen. Crepes, pancakes, eggs, garlic toast or whatever it works. Now then as to heat distribution and cleaning. Even heat distribution is not now nor ever has been hallmark of cast iron. That's why you see see pro Chefs moving them around on occasion and it's not that big a deal to do. The idea that you cannot use a mild detergent on cast iron is bogus. Clean your iron as soon as you can under HOT running water, use a drop or two of dish soap (I use Dawn) and if you need to scrub do so only with a synthetic bristle brush. Wipe it dry, put a few drops of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub it ALL over before storage."
"Purchased this to try the youtube question: 'can a cheap piece of cast iron be polished to the point of flipping over easy eggs?' Yes, yes it can. EDIT: May 22, 2021 This flat iron skillet has been one of the best $15 purchases I have ever made. Not only has it taught me how to incorporate cast iron into my daily living, for the fist time in my life, I'm getting 100% success rate on over easy eggs. I never touch it with water, it never leaves the burner, I make grilled cheese, pancakes, sear meat, and with the cheese melting hood (stainless steel upside down bowl with a handle) fry steaks, the best Frenchtoast and thin pancakes (crepes) then wipe clean with a paper towel. This is a bachelor's perfect go to cast iron skillet."
"This Lodge skillet is a nice size at 12"" and weighs about 4 1/2 pounds. It comes with a nice even factory seasoning over the entire pan and handle. After giving it a light washing to remove any oils from the factory I gave it a light coating of vegetable oil. Now I am by no means an awesome cook, so I made a turkey burger as a first test run. It heats up fast and distributes and holds heat very well. Cooking the burger was fast and did result in some sticking/burning which I suspect is because the burger was so lean being turkey meat. I used a 12"" cover to aid in cooking which fit perfectly. Being cast iron the handle does get hot as expected. After cooking I put some water on the pan to loosen any burnt bits. After eating I washed the pan with only hot water and a scouring pad which cleaned it up nice and easy. All in all, I am happy with my purchase and look forward to making some other dish, maybe queseadillas? :D"
"This pan is fairly light weight compare to most cast iron and heats up quickly. Somebody thinking about trying or that complains about the weight should start with this pan. I ditched all of my teflon pans and switched to cast iron. Safer, food taste better, made in USA and will last for generations. Once you learn how to properly use cast iron they are a joy to cook with. I season mine with lard in the oven, there are plenty of videos how to season cast iron online. Also when you cook with cast iron there are a few rules to remember. 1 It takes little bit to heat up. I put mine on the burner at the temp I plan on cooking with and leave it there for 5 plus minutes. This gives it time to heat up evenly. 2 Cast iron retains heat so do crank your burner to high thinking you are saving time on the heat up. Now you have to wait for it to cool evenly. 3. NO dry cooking. Unless you are making something that produces it's own grease like bacon you need to put something in the pan first. A little butter or oil."
"After discouraging results from la creuset (shattered ceramic coating at moderate temps and hard to clean) I bought my old standby iron, and it is still great. Somehow the preseasoning has turned this into wonderful non stick. Tfal fails in a year or less, the granite and hyped copper last a few months. The iron lasts generations and just a few wipes and it’s clean. Skip the ceramics, they are a waste, including la creuset. Lodge will be there long after I am gone. Just cook at lowest temps, let the iron cook the food, not the stove. Even crepes pop off. Lodge has it right."
"excellent quality. it will last u forever. I am so pleased with this pan. It is my second favorite. I have a 10.5 inch old cast iron frying pan that is my favorite, but only because it has been used for decades. Give me 15 to 20 years and this one will be up there too. They only get better with age! This 10.5 iches pan was shipped already pre-seasoned; however, I washed it in hot soapy water, dried it well and then re-seasoned it myself. Then I put it to the ultimate test, I fried an egg over medium heat without using any oil, butter or bacon grease (gasp!) and it came out perfect! The egg was easy to flip and did not stick at all. When I was done, I just wiped it out with a clean and dry dishcloth and put it away. Anyway, I have used this pan multiple times and with each use, it just gets better and better. You can't beat good cast iron. The second handle on the pan is a brilliant idea. Makes pouring hot gravy or other foods/liquids out of the skillet super easy, since cast iron is so heavy. This is my third or fourth cast iron piece made by Lodge. The quality is superior. The durability is life long. I know that this will be the last 10.5 inch skillet purchase that I make. It will certainly outlive me. I would highly recommend your purchasing this skillet. FYI: I have a glass cook top and cast iron works the best. It always heats evenly, it doesn't wobble because the bottom is truly flat and you can fry chicken or even stir fry over medium heat without sticking or burning if well seasoned and as I said above, it only gets better the more your use it. Good-bye non-stick skillets. It is only cast iron for me."
"We love using cast iron cookware, lodge products Are USA made which is a plus in my book. This griddle is top quality just like our other two frying pans also made my lodge.  I see a few reviews complaint of rust, well first off you only clean a cast iron product with very hot water and a plastic scrubber, that’s it! No soap! Your product issues are user error and not the product. I just got this today and have already used it for supper, nice crisp potato cakes! Washed and dried up nice. Remember to oil your cast iron before you put them away and season them every 6 months."
"I have many nonstick and ceramic pans but really wanted something that can hold the heat on my glass top stove. I have another cast iron taller walled pan which is great for grilling type activities indoors. This one is fantastic for shallow cooking. Pancakes come out beautifully with even toasting and it holds the heat well throughout. Also great for grilled cheese. This is for a purpose pan, not extremely versatile given the very shallow walls -- put chicken or a burger on it and guaranteed you will have splatter all about."
"I own a few vintage Griswold cast iron pans which are great because they have a smooth surface however I purchased this Lodge griddle on a whim because it was priced well and I wanted something flat since it's much easier to use a spatula with this.  This is turning out to be one of my most used pieces. It really is nice to work with for things like a grilled cheese sandwich, pancakes and even a steak.  It's also not real heavy like the other standard Lodge pans, which is another reason I don't generally prefer Lodge pans.  I wish I had a 9"" model of this instead as 10.5"" can sometimes feel a bit too large."
This is hands down one of my best purchases for this year. I read another review by this person who talked about using this pan to make dosas which are a staple breakfast item in South India (rice crepes). We had been using a non-stick griddle all this time and they usually warp. We have been worried about using Teflon as well.  I am so glad that I purchased this product. This is a really heavy cast iron griddle and reminds me of the authentic dosa pans used in South India. You can see how great the dosas turned out to be. Don't be frustrated if your dosa sticks to the pan. This is expected. You need to season the pan a little bit by scrubbing it with salt and onion. The pan gets better with usage. Add generous amounts of oil when you are making the dosa at least for the first few times until the pan gets seasoned enough.  The handle gets hot when you keep it on the stove for a long time. I would strongly recommend using an oven mitt. Also use a thin spatula (preferably a steel one) to turn the dosas.
"For $15, this pan is an unreal dream. Minor complaints: 1. Flashing was ground in a non-uniform manner (but this shows the pan was hand-tooled) 2. There were a few pin-hole bubbles in the finish - very small and very few 3. Pre-seasoning was not well implemented. You need to season the pan. The bottom side started rusting after 2 uses. (I cleaned off the rust and seasoned the pan on all sides. No more rust problem.)  To season the pan, use a paper towel to completely coat the pan with canola oil or another low flash-point temperature vegetable oil. Place oiled pan in very hot oven (475F is a good choice) for 60 to 90 minutes. Allow oven to cool with the pan in it. Wash and rinse pan by hand with mild soap. Repeat entire process 3 to 5 times and you will be good to go - and your $15 pan will perform like one that cost $75 and food won't stick when you cook."

"I am very pleased with this cast iron griddle. It is perfect for pancakes, eggs, quesadillas, and many other meals. It is very easy to clean and season.  For those who do not know how to season your cast iron cookware, here is what @LodgeCastIron told me to do via Twitter:  1. Wash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. 2. Rinse and dry completely. 3. Apply a very thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware inside and out. Too much oil will result in a sticky finish. 4. Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven (not directly on bottom) to catch any drips. 5. Set oven temperature to 350 – 400 degrees F. 6. Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven to prevent pooling. 7. Bake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven. 8. Store the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled.  Repeat these steps as necessary, until your cookware is seasoned to your liking. Steps 1-3 are recommended after each use of your cookware."
"In addition to all the other applications mentioned by other reviews, I use the pan as a ""plate"" to keep food hot in the winter.  I just preheat the pans in the oven (300F or whatever temperature the oven is at) while cooking dishes and each person gets one griddle as his/her plate to eat out of. The griddle/tray/plate keeps the food hot/warm (depending on how hot you preheat it originally) during the meal in the winter time. If there is an interruption and the food gets cold or lukewarm, just put the griddle on the stove to heat for a couple of minutes - voila, your food is hot again!  To protect the dining table, I just set the preheated griddle on a trivet or a dry tea towel. A small wood chopping board works also."
"Wow, what is not to like about Lodge cookware. I purchased this to cook my husbands eggs. Although it is seasoned I still put just a little Crisco on it each time I use and wash it. It has not disappointed. The eggs come up with out sticking and cook very evenly. I will add, being cast iron, it conducts temperature very well, and I have found I need to reduce my stove temperature to keep from burning my eggs. I have used it for grill cheese sandwiches (perfect), warm tortilla shells, and grill some hotdogs on the stove top. I use it all of the time."
I am not a chef or anything like that just needed something to make the kids breakfast and lunch without having those non-stick pan shavings in our food and also I can never find a nonstick pan that is actually non-stick so you end up putting oil on it no matter what. I really like this cast iron pan I wish I would have discovered this a long time ago. A little bit of cooking oil to condition it and it Cooks everything great with no sticking and just clean it with soap and water and make sure you dry it so you never have any rust problems and I really like it
I love a Lodge Cast Iron Pan!! If I ever recommend a cast iron pan it will be Lodge! They are always well seasoned and durable! I think I might have a slight addiction to things of cast iron such as pans but they are absolutely a necessity if you are a chef or cook! They always give the best results! They heat evenly and are versatile cooking in the stove in the stove or on a campfire! I have taken my pans from the house to camping and am never disappointed. Although I do recommend scrubbing them well before bringing a pan you used camping back into the house for cooking since the soot from the fire will turn things black!
"Wow-za -love this so much that it is my every day go to! Never been a fan of cast iron, but I've been told that you can't do better than Lodge and I happened to want one for occasional use. It now resides on the back burner and I use it nearly every time I cook. Easy to care for and has a wide variety of uses -warm a tortilla (curse you electric stove!!!) , finish a steak in the oven, saute onions and peppers, etc. Heats evenly and so quickly. Cleaning is a no brainer -just be sure to lovingly give it a smidge of oil after you dry it on the burner. Oh, how I love this little pan! Every kitchen should have one of these handy pans."
I ordered this pan as a replacement but got so much more. It is lighter and is now a goto pan for that reason. My other cast iron has taller sides and slightly larger making it difficult to use and clean. The lodge is perfectly sized.  I removed the label wipe off and then added dome oil to season it slightly before use. It comes preseasoned but I had to clean it again because that is what I do. I made blueberry pancakes to start and finished the day using it to grill onions. The lodge cast iron pan performed perfectly.  I am ordering another for my mother as she is older and her cast iron pan is too big and heavy she has trouble lifting it. These pans last a lifetime and you cannot beat this price.
I researched cast iron brands prior to purchasing my first cast iron piece. Lodge come up as the number 1 or 2 pick in several different searches.  I than research best skillets for homemade tortillas and this skillet kept coming up.  Absolutely love this skillet. It is everything one could ever ask for in cast iron. Just follow cleaning directions and you shouldn’t have any problems.  I have purchased 3 additional Lodge cast iron pieces since this one.
"Bought this skillet about 2 years ago. And in the beginning I wondered if it was the right choice, as in the beginning I had to build up tha seasoning a bit and you also have to get used to the weight of the pan and the hot handle. I thought my good egg frying days were over but In fact they are not. I make amazing eggs with a little oil / butter on a low heat (always allowing the pan about 5"" to fully warm up) and it makes the best crepes. Meanwhile I have been trough an other 3 tefal pans which really don't last. This pan is amazing if you love it in the right way.dont get upset if in the beginning you don't understand him right away!!!!  And... in the beginning after every wash , heat the pan up till smoking and then add a thin coat of oil. For me it really worked to fry some morning bacon, and just leave the pan dirty over night. Don't buy this pan if you are on a extreme fat free diet, buy a steamer."
"Lodge is a American Company that has a great reputation for manufacturing fine cast iron cookware at a fair price. This griddle was my latest purchase to add to my collection of other Lodge Products. The griddle is perfect for eggs, pancakes and toasted sandwiches. The griddle has a even heat surface. It's low wall makes it easy for flipping. Maintenance is very easy. I mostly just wipe out the pan/griddle with a dry paper towel. Then spray a light coating of cooking spray and wipe off the excess with the same paper towel. Heavy soiled- I hand wash with liquid detergent and a nylon brush. Wipe dry then oil with cooking spray."
"Maybe I am just picky, but in my opinion, nothing beats the old Grisworld cast iron pans.. But these take a nice second to me.. They are made in the USA, and are of good quality.  I have not had much of any problems with washing them.. I have had food stick a little to them, but, I soaked it in hot water for just a few minutes, and they usually clean with no effort. Overall, I have had no real problems with the Lodge ones..  I have used many different brands and types of cast iron pans over the years, and one thing I have found a lot.. The Chinese made ones all seem to have food stick to them more, and rust a LOT easier then American made ones. The Chinese ones also do not hold a good seasoning either.. I have not had much of a problem with either of these things with the Lodge brand cast iron pans."
"I ordered this griddle to make pancakes and couldn’t be happier with the results. I took the griddle out of the shipping box, washed it and put it to use immediately making pancakes the next morning. I’ve cooked with only cast iron frying pans for years and was very impressed with this griddle, I only needed two teaspoons of butter to grease the griddle to make 12 perfect pancakes with it, no seasoning needed beyond how the pan came. I’m looking forward to many years use from this pan and I have to say it was a pleasure to cook with it."
"First, I am a Huge fan of Lodge Cast Iron. Second, I love this addition to my collection because I can cook so many things on it. I've done pancakes, biscuits, and hamburgers. It heats evenly, the food has a colorful shading to the tops and bottoms, and cleanup can't be easier. I purchased use the sponge covered in chainmail to wash my cast iron and in one or two sweeps this is spotless. I coat it with a whisper of canola oil and put it away for the next use - which will be soon!"
I already had one of these and last week decided to try and make a steak in it on the wood stove in our basement. I got the wood stove super hot with the pan on top. Threw my butter in the pan and a rib steak into the pan. in less than a minute for each side and I had the most perfect steak ever! A beautiful crusty outside and red and rare inside. I love it so much I decided to get another so I can make dinner for two if the girl friend is here or for the dogs. Dogs do love steak also. I love to cook on charcoal but I never thought cooking a steak in a cast iron pan would beat that but it did.
"What a wonderful wonderful pan. I kept wanting a non-stick pan for everyday use and who would have thunk this cast iron would become it for me. I make french toast, bread toast, pancakes, Dosa, eggs, chappathi (Indian wheat flat bread) and they all come off as easy. You don't need a whole lot of oil as much as you need to preheat it. Just the thinnest layer of oil will do.  1) I baked/seasoned it in the oven for 1.5 hrs at 450. Leave fans/windows open for this part.  2) First pancake I made stuck on the pan with it's dear life for fear of being eaten.  3) I started making buttered toasts on it for toddler then french toasts by the time I tried pancakes and Dosas (Indian crepes) again in 3 weeks it came off so smooth that I tried an egg and was very pleasantly surprised that it just slid off.  4) Heat it at a high heat and lower it since it holds heat really well.  5) To wash when pan is just warm to touch (not hot) wash it under hot water. I use soap on mine occasionally the slightest amount and seasoning is still intact.  6) After washing dry it completely dry and oil pan again wipe of excess and let oil burn off and turn heat off.  Sounds so much more harder than it is. Being patient in the being will pay off in the long run. Take care of it and it will last longer than us. Will not go back to a non stick. I also bought a bigger one for stir fry and cooking."
"I love this thing! Its perfect for livermush squares, salmon patties, etc. Things that can crumble or break apart if you have the wrong angle. I wouldn't take anything for my worn in 10.25 standard Lodge skillet, and I can tell already Im gonna feel the same way about this griddle. Fits the coil of my electric stove, and heats way better than the square model would have(I'll probably get that one too) I wouldn't attempt much bacon or very greasy food personally with this as it's awful shallow. May have a flare up if you aren't carefull. No drip spout either. I always reseason cast iron, so not much to say there except this griddle was actually quite smooth from Lodge.  Amazon, as always I love it when you just throw heavy loose iron pieces in a cardboard box with a couple airbags. Yeah, they'll help. I've bought multiple pieces over the past few months. All single pieces came loose, knocking around with each other. It is amazing none have cracked."

"Two items stayed permanently on my stovetop....the 80 year old 8” cast iron frying pan my mom got as a bride and the 2-burner griddle. Both are perfect. BUT I wanted to downsize from the griddle since I’m generally cooking only for one these days. Finally bought this round griddle but expected inferior performance due to bumpy surface and lack of “mature” seasoning. I was WRONG!! I love this griddle and use it constantly. Finish is smoother than I expected and after initial cleaning and my own seasoning it’s performing like an old pro. And I gain a freed-up burner! Every household should have one, maybe even two!"
"This griddle pan is the best! I have all kinds of cast iron pans, but I find I reach for this little buddy all the time. The browning you get from it is superb! I love that it fits in my Breville Smart Oven Air so I can start something - like a Filet - brown it and then finish it in the Breville. I did go ahead and do the pan seasoning when I first got it (even though you don't have to/instructions on their website) and absolutely nothing sticks. After cleaning I also wipe a thin layer of olive oil over it every time before putting it away. Love it and am so glad I bought it!"
"I got this griddle because I love cast iron and our griddle at home was cheap and needed to be replaced. My wife, with most of my purchases was skeptical at first. Once it came we had guests over and I made smash burgers with fried cheese. Her opinion changed after that. I have made steaks, eggs, pancakes and bacon on this and everything comes out perfect. There is a learning curve once you own one. I would suggest watching some YouTube videos on the upkeep and once you figure out how to dial in the temp settings for optimal cooking you will be impressing yourself and guests on some amazing food! Just be sure to buy a metal spatula when you purchase cast iron as you will need something sturdy to get under your food. Hopefully this information helps and if you do purchase this griddle, enjoy a new standard of cooking!"
I'm not sure that every one of these 999 calls & murders have been 100 percent accurate in their portrayal but they are well documented & entertaining if true crime is a venue one enjoys.
"Very boring, they reuse the same footage over and over again, bad delivery of what happened in general, not a good ""tone"". I couldn't get through more than a couple episodes."
"If you are into crime shows, criminal investigation, murder mysteries, and similar themes, then these episodes should keep your attention. The acting isn't overtly poor most of the time, although not great, they play real emergency call recordings, and interview the actual friends and loved ones, capturing their true thoughts and emotions. The original investigators and reporters also talk about the crimes, reminiscing about the suspects' behaviors, words, and actions that led them to come to specific conclusions. This show is not of the in depth quality of great true crime shows such as Forensic Files and FBI Files. They barely get into forensics, and only discuss basic investigative techniques. However, it's not bad, and every episode is decent. Although I was doing other things while watching, I binge watched all the episodes in this one season without hesitation. They're all interesting, and often shocking cases that really make you think. The fact that the actual recordings are played raise the sense of drama and urgency. There is a bit of repetition in some of the scenes, but it's not too bad- there's no overly dramatic narration or constant music messing things up. If you're into crime and investigation, this is an entertaining show to watch. I enjoyed it."
If you like crime shows with a little more of the backstory of the 999/911 calls this is a good show.
I'm sure the stories would be fun but the acting is painful.
I'm really surprised by this set! I cook a lot and seems like no matter what I would end up with my coating starting to bubble and peel off. Even with top brands! So I took a chance on these ines that I do not regret. I can cook on high heat and so far have not had any bubbling appear! The coloring on these is gorgeous as well and even wifh being thrown in the sink and slid around there arent yet any scratches in coating or the paint on the outside. They are truly non stick and clean up so easily! I think I may have found my new favorite brand of cookware!
The pots are very good quality for the price. These are only the second set of pots that I've owned and the previous was from a very well known and popular brand. I find that these are better quality than those. I didn't have any utensils when these arrived and used one of those fancy silver plastic spoons and I did scrape the bottom of one pot which I am surprised but the owners manual did list it's approved type of utensils and that was not one of them :/  Other wise the pots are no overly heavy or very light. The color is pretty. I also use a low flame and the food heats pretty quickly and cooks evenly. I just wish I was able to complete the set by buying the non-stick baking items in the same color. (I'm pretty much starting from scratch here). The clean VERY easily too.
"I have to say I am a bit of a cookware snob. I had a beautiful cookware set for 20+ years that was still in great condition but I adopted a cockatiel so I had to replace it with ptfe/ptoa free cookware. I bought another, much more expensive set, that I absolutely hated. I used it for 3 months before I couldn't take using it anymore. I did an extensive search on Amazon and decided on this set. I figured if I didn't like it at least I didn't spend much money on it. I am very surprised by how much I love it. Not as heavy as my original set but it's not flimsy by any means."
Pots came on time! They are so beautiful and fits well with my kitchen decor. Can’t wait to use them !
"Just received product have not used yet, packaged securely! Washed items no water spots. Not sure if the square pan is a defect being able to see the imprint of the bottom,, dont see that on the other pans.. Cant wait to use them!  UPDATE These pans are so easy to clean! I use only plastic or wooden spoons and do see some minor scratching on the pots, will consider changing my wooden spoons. Very happy with heat distribution, the square pan doesn't seem to heat as fast as the others but could be the burner layout."
What I ordered the 14 piece set I went by all the reviews. I was not let down and was very pleased after I watched him I immediately started cooking with them and I am not disappointed I am very happy with everything that came with the set I look for 2 using all of it soon
"My wife literally loves these pots and pans. We have had them for about a month and they are still like new. Easy to clean, they get super hot, and they’re a very nice color."
I love the set. It is sooooo pretty and the color is truly rose gold. Matches my toaster teapot and my garbage can. I'd recommend this pot and pan set to a million people if I knew a million people lol. Ladies or men you have to get this beautiful set. Great company to buy from becuz they told the truth about their product! Thanks WONDERFUL company. I'm super happy!!!!!!
Love all the different sizes but the fact that you are forced to leave a review to get the 1 year warranty is ridiculous.
"The color and design are beautiful. I couldn't stop enjoy looking at the cookware and feeling exited to have one set for myself. I brought the pots set and the baking set separately but I opened them at the same time. When I put them all together on my kitchen, I feel like I finally understand why some people like to hang their pots out instead of putting them away in the kitchen cabinets as some cookware like these are really beautiful. I enjoy using them to cook. They have less smoke when cooking compare to my old cookware. They heat up very evenly and hotter then my old cookware. Most importantly, they are really non-sticky and super easy to clean.  Con: However it's easy to scratch on the side toward the bottom when use on regular stove. But for the inside, I used only plastic or wood utensils to cook and have no problem."
DO NOT BUY THESE POTS SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Ive used them about 7 times the color is chipping off and you can't even stack them or use a bamboo spatula because they will get scratch very easily.
"The set came with nothing defective or missing. I have been using them daily since and they are super easy to clean, definitely nonstick, and very beautiful. Not sure how long they will last but for 100 dollars for 14 pieces, they are worth it. I only use wooden/silicon spaculars for cooking and chopsticks if I decide to eat out of the pot (no one need to wash one extra bowl when the pots themselves are so shining), and clean it with normal sponge. So far no scratch observed. Excellent purchase."
The product came really fast after ordering it online. It looks and feels very sturdy and expensive. I can't wait to cook with them.
"Amazing quality and build. They feel heavy and sturdy. Perfect set of cookware with all pan and pots sizes needed, plus a square pan. Time will tell about durability, but from what a see on initial usage when compared to other brand I have, think this will do amazing. The no PTFE/PFOA/PFOS-Free is a must, I just wish it was written on the box. Very pleased with my purchase and will recommend to anyone."
looks beautiful! hope they work the same well as they look. The only wish is that there was more than 3 pots as it seem to be too few for a family of 5
"This is my first set of pans that I’ve bought as an adult and lemme tell ya- WAY BETTER THAN MY GOODWILL STUFF AND HAND ME DOWNS IVE BEEN USING FOR 4 years!!!!! I’m never going back to not non stick. With These pans, you don’t have to scrub to remove every single thing. Just run under the faucet and everything glides off! It’s very easy to use. It’s been a few months and there still aren’t any scratches. 5 stars, definitely would recommend."
These pans are great and we love them. The color and cleaning is great and easy! Couldn’t recommend this enough.
I was looking for a chemical free pot and pan set and after plenty of research I felt like this was the best choice for me. When I received my pots and pans It was packaged very well and the box was not damaged however the big pot was dented just like other reviews have said. So I quickly reached out to the company and they shipped me a new one with in a few days no problems what so ever. Great customer service! I highly recommend this pot and pan set.
"I have tried a handful of ""non-stick"" pan sets and none of them have worked as well as these. Food slides off the surface allowing me to use less oil/butter and making clean up so much faster. Plus I love the unique color. We have a small kitchen and have to hang out pans on the wall so having a nice color is actually important since they're part of my decor."
"Looks beautiful, haven't used it yet because I just got it last night but will update this if it's not great, after I am done using them to cook Thanksgiving dinner. I had to replace my pot and pans set that I'd used for the last 10 years that I received used from a family member after my divorce. So I was concerned about the quality of pans now and whether they'd last like my old ones do. Hoping these will withstand my 13 year old, my one year old, and my husband."
"I love the design & color! These are light weight, easy to clean non stick pans. We have a pet bird in the house so I was specifically looking for a nice set of PTFE & PFOA free pans. The matching kitchen utensils and silicone are a bonus! Instructions say handwash to maintain performance and appearance, but Amazon product description says it's dishwasher safe."
We bought these pans to use with our induction heating stovetop. The pans are well built and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend these pans for anyone who uses an induction heating stovetop.
"even more gorgeous in person! the color is beautiful, thick and sturdy-yet still light weight enough for me to be able to carry the whole box by myself! everything single dish and lid came separately wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap. not a scratch or dent in sight! I’m in love with this set."
I love this set! It's great quality and made in the USA - what more could one want! It's sturdy without being overly heavy. It cooks evenly and it cleans up easily. The handles are insulated and stay cool to the touch. I highly recommend this set!
"Beautiful cookware. It is light weight. It is replacing a much heavier set that I can no longer lift when it it full of food. I am impressed with the fact the non stick has none of the toxins I've heard so much about, and still is nonstick!"
I have had this set now for a few weeks and would highly recommend! They require very little oil use and nothing sticks down... making it very easy to clean. Would strongly suggest their recommendation of using either wood or silicon for cooking with these pans to prevent scratching.
I didn’t think I’d like the silicon on the handles as I prefer traditional type cookware. But I appreciated them when I had a pot bowling over and could just grab it off the burner! They are very easy to clean and I just love the color. If you cant afford copper cookware but really want a similar look this is an excellent compromise.
"We had spent several weeks reviewing many different pan sets and decided on this one. (We've had bad experiences in the past and didn't want this to be another one!) Package was delivered on time and in good condition. Items were well packed and no major damage found. Lids fit the appropriate pans, and no dents or scratches were observed. Love the gold color. Washed pans in warm water and soap as suggested. Hoping that hand washing instead of putting in the dishwasher will extend the life. Looking forward to trying them on dinner this evening!"
Great set of cookware. We are in the middle of a move and it will be a while till our household good arrive so I purchased these to use in the meantime and they are great!! I’m very happy with this set!
"got these for my bachelor brother and he just loves them! Loves the color, smooth sleek interiors that are so easy to clean and the outside is a pretty blue! Just perfect for him and the strainer that fits the pans is a bonus!!!"
"Wife lives these. Bought as a replacement for her mix match pans. A bit concerned about the handles get hot, but they stay cool. Have used these myself and definitely non stick and very easy cleaup."
So far product this has been great. Easy to clean and light weight to handle. So far no issues.
Got this for my boyfriend after he was jealous of my father's non-stick pot set. He loves it. He couldn't wait to use them. Love that you can get a decent set without having to break the bank for them. You won't regret it.

"Purchased pan set because it was a great deal. I have had them for a few weeks now and no complaint yet. Solid pans and nonstick is great. I hand wash them due to our dishwasher does a heat cycle we like but it is supposed to be bad for the nonstick side, no big deal. I would definitely recommend."
This was a great gift to myself in my new home. The whole set is wonderful. The handles had a grip on them that makes grabbing them easier. The copper color is amazing and cooks great. Everything is non stick and fits perfectly in my kitchen. Cleaning is a breeze. As long as you follow the info sheet given these pots should last a long time. I’ve seen similar pot sets for much more. The price is nice and you’re getting a really good product out of it
"I really like the set, just wish it was dishwasher safe. Easy to clean and really is nonstick, I just like the option to be lazy and let the dishwasher do all the work!"
Amazing pans! First thing we cooked was a 3 egg omelet in the big frying pan! Perfection and wiped out clean!
Very good quality cookware so far. I'm impressed with the color and weight. Just recieved them today. Will update review after I use them
I've used this product so many times and I'm in love. Everything cooks well and no sticking. I also love the strainer that comes with it.
I received the cookware quickly! All pots and pans look very nice. I have not started to use them yet. I will update after a few months of use.
"just got them haven't use it yet but the pots look great ,love the color,they came right on time and very well packaged."
"Pot handles could be thicker, cover to not burn yourself a bit better quality, but works"
This set is amazing my kids purchased for me for Mother’s Day and it been so nice cooking with them. It’s easy to clean you can almost just rinse and it’s clean. Love them
I ordered this set because of the great price and the quality. When I received it I was surprised how good quality they really are and everything was so safely packaged I was impressed. Will definitely be buying this brand again
I just received the set on 5/10/22. It's been unpacked but I haven't used it yet. Looks as nice as I expected. Keeping the box it was shipped in for a future move. So excited to use it!!!!
"Beautiful, high quality product. Looks just like as pictured. Great price as well! 10/10 recommend."
"Great set! Love the strainer, work great, very attractive, good deal."
"Quality is top notch, looking forward to using these. Will update this review after some usage."
This is a very good quality set. Very happy with all the sizes of pots and pans that come in this set. Easy to clean and seems like they will last. Great value for the money!
"We’ve been using this set for a few weeks now and we love it! Delivered in perfect condition and it has held up to us cooking every day. It’s beautiful, too! We are hand washing and using safe utensils only."
"The pots and pans look very sturdy, beautiful, and well made. I have not used them yet so I can't speak to their durability or ease of cleaning."
The product came promptly. Examining the package everything was neatly and securely packaged. It looks really nice on the stove. I can't wait to cook some amazing recipes.
Just out of the box and appears to be amazing quality. Can’t wait to get washed and use for the first time.
"I am extremely pleased with this set of pots and pans! And, the utensils that come with it are also very nice, which is always a bonus. The plastic handles are sturdy and will make hot pans easy to move. I am so excited to use these in my first apartment!"
Very nice looking cookware. So far very happy. Only had product for 01 day.
Great pot set. It’s so good that it has so many pieces. I love how many frying pans there are. It’s nonstick which is definitely a huge plus.
Awesome set of cookware and seems to be even heat my wife lives the color and is easy to cook with and use wooden spoons to not scratch them is what we do
I brought this set for my wife and she loves it! Thanks so much for fast shipping and a quality set!! Would recommend to anyone!
Very good quality pots an pans. Beautiful color. Very nicely packaged with great care! I recommend these for the quality and price!
Absolutely love my new pots. Easy to clean and nothing sticks to them. I absolutely give them five stars and highly recommend.  I cook everyday and use these amazing pots!
Very pretty set. Enhanced my kitchen. Please do not hesitate to buy. You won't regret it.
Easy to clean! Beautiful set!
"Great construction and color. Used a few pans immediately upon receiving and was pleased by cooking surface...no sticking, food able to be stirred and flipped easily, and quick clean-up. Love the griddle pan... great for so many items! Only regret is that we did not order these pans earlier."
Great set of pots and pans with lots of extras and the price is unbeatable
"I like how it looks, haven't used yet so I'm hoping it works great."
"I have only used the pots and pans a few times so far, but I love them!! They are super non-stick! The strainer attachment is amazing."
"Este set fue un regalo de boda para mi hija. Lo recibió pronto y le encantó. No le llegó el sartén cuadrado, pero llamé y me lo enviaron de inmediato. Muy bueno su costumer service."

Love these pans . Nothing sticks when cooking and easy to clean .
"High quality pans I absolutely love ❤️ them. Also just wanted to say NEVER use a metal spatula on these pans it will destroy them, I notice on the wok review picture that someone used metal and complained about the pan not being none stick but they showed a metal spatula had been used on the pan. 😞 sad. update this pan was very well taken care of but did not hold up for very long, I am very disappointed with what has happened 😢😡 date of photo 1/23/2021"
"If, like me, you've been looking for a decent, well-made, and reasonably priced non-stick pan, keep looking. This one is not it. The first time I used this pan, I made a fried egg and it came out perfect. Then I hand washed it and put it away. The second time I used it, I put a little bit of olive oil and watched the oil run to the sides of the pan. I then poured some pancake batter and it too ran to sides. This pan is now convex, it's not flat anymore and I did nothing to cause it except make an egg on low/medium heat.. I'm just so frustrated that we can't make a decent pan in the U.S. Skip this one."
"They are very easy to clean. I made curry spaghetti and I prepared the curry paste in my new pan and nothing got stuck there. Also, I have cooked scramble eggs, fried onion and pancakes without any issue. They are just great."
"I've been stuck with a bad pan previously. No matter how much oil you put in it, eggs always end up getting stuck to the pan. The pan was old, and scratched up. I bought this new pan from Michelangelo and it changed things around for me. I actually enjoy cooking on it. I start out with heat on 4 out of 6 and wait for it to warm up, then add a tiny bit of oil even though the pan is already oily. I add the eggs, the eggs cook thoroughly without being stuck to the pan.  I don't know how anyone can cook so badly that their pan gets all brown and destroyed. Don't use metal sponges i guess? I'd like to buy another pan that has taller walls, if that makes sense.. for bigger quantity cooking.  Don't be afraid to try this pan out, i wasn't. The 8 inch is too small for 5 eggs cooking, get the 10 inch plus."
"I like these pans and are the second set I ordered. Because I didn’t pay attention to the instructions with the first set, I ruined them by using high heat and once they were burnt they were impossible to clean. I ordered my second set because I really like them, they’re nonstick, easy to clean and have nice lids that actually fit, OH, not to mention, AFFORDABLE!"
"I am thrilled with these pans! No sticking, browns meats, i can put it in the oven and they are easy to clean! so easy i do not even put them in the dishwasher! and they are very pretty! I have used them everyday since i received them and could not be happier! this from someone who hates to cook! i wanted cast iron but because of arthritis i can not handle the weight...these work just as well as cast iron and i can lift them . they are easier to clean and prettier than cast iron!"
"I've had these pans for about 4 months, and they are still in perfect condition. They have seen (not my fault) metal spatulas and silverware, the oven, and are always cleaned in the dishwasher. So far they have been great!"
"Love the sizes (9 and 11), the lids and the overall usability of these pans. I usually use a small amount of cooking oil or butter with them and they work great. Had one of these for 4 years and burned it badly by not turning the burner off. Got the set of two as replacements and they are great."
"I've had a Michelangelo 3 qt pot for three years now. Solid performance, nonstick is strong. These are the same. Made a frittata in the small pan yesterday. Slid out easily, cleaning a breeze."
"Wonderfully non-stick surface. Easy to clean, cooks evenly, and looks great! I've only had them for a month so I can't speak for longevity, but straight out of the box they're the best pans I've ever purchased."
"Nothing so far has taken more than a dry paper towel to clean. .I always wash it anyway, but everything just wipes right off."
"These pans really do heat evenly. You really don’t need to add spray oil to keep food from sticking. They cook food perfectly with less oil and no high heat needed. We always had high end chef pans, but these are by far better."
I looooove them. Wish they were lighter but it’s not a big deal. They’re great! Easy to clean and big enough for family of 3+ cooking without the hassle of many pots and cramming.
These are the best pans! I will never use stainless again! We take very good care of them and don’t put them in the dishwasher it’s a bit more time but cooking with them is a dream. Best pans!
Easy to cook with. Remember to use medium heat to avoid damaging the pans.
"I bought a new induction cooktop & these work very well on it! Even cooking, easy to clean and I hope they last a long time!"
They are beautiful and love cooking on them as no food ever sticks to bottom and super easy to clean.
"If you are on the fence with this one, don't be. I have paid a lot for other cookware, but this one it great and a keeper. Very easy to clean. Cooks evenly, sits flat on by burner. I love these. I even bought the 3 quart sauce pan as well."
"Love the non-stick feature, cool handles (although the lid handle does get hot), and easy clean-upI can't common on durability since I've had it only a short time, and the thickness is what it is. All I know is it's a great frying pan set."
Any of these Michelangelo pans are great. Nearly indestructible. Like those TV commercials that seem fake. Just rinse and wipe. I love them so much I bought several as gifts.
"Nice skillet and the lid helps. We found out that you need oil, spray, or something on it before you cook in it as items tend to stick or burn easily to the pan."
"Thrilled with these pans - cooks evenly and at a lower temperature than I'm used to, cleans so easily"
My husband loves these pans. He won't use any thing else.
"Great product, love having nonstick that actually works!!"
"I bought these pans for my husband's Christmas present. He wanted these sizes, and he wanted non-stick pans with lids. I couldn't find any small size pans with lids at all in stores, so turned to good ole Amazon. Happy with the purchase."
They are lightweight and easy to clean. They cook evenly too.
I have been having these pans for about a month now. My family absolutely loves them! They clean easy and sticking!
"These are extremely sturdy and very nice looking. They can be cleaned with a dot of dish soap, water and just wipe them out. They cook well. Good vaule"
Very easy to clean. Great non-stick quality
These are GREAT pans. They seem to cook evenly and are a cinch to clean up. I'd highly recommend.
I like everything about this cookware  everything about this cook ware
This product is exactly as described and expected. I recommend this seller.
I love the MICHELANGELO copper frying pans. They are easy to clean and a joy to cook in. Thank you!
These pans go be on my expectations.
Nice pans. The handles are hollow so cleaning itis a little difficult but otherwise they’re great
this pan cooks even and great and man just wipe it off and everything comes off. Finally a product that actually works!
Same as above
"These are so great. We’re replacing our other pots and pans now. These cook evenly, easy to clean and look good. Highly recommend."
Nonstick and super easy to clean. Getting the 2 different sizes was perfect for my cooking needs.
Absolutely love these pans! They are amazing for non-stick and easy clean up!
Love them!
Just bought these to get by until I found really good pans. These are fantastic for the money though.
These pans have great fitting clear glass covers and are exactly what I was looking for. Great non stick feature and they clean up easy.
"I bought these pans because I needed an extra 8”. It's the best buy : easy to use, food doesn't stick and easy to clean"
I love these. I bought a second set for my travel trailer.
And they are so easy to clean. They also have a nice heft to them. I’ve never cooked eggs so well.
This skillet heats evenly and cleans up beautifully. I sear & sautee in it. Love the set.
My husband attached his mountain bike to this and is vey pleased with the quality.
"This pans are amazing, I am in love with them!!! 100% recommend them"
"These are well made, highest quality material with just the right amount weight for handling while cooking. The lids are a BONUS. LUV, LUV, LUV"
loose knobs
"Great frying pans! Easy to clean, the thickness allows you to cook evenly without burning and doesn’t cook too fast. I liked them so much, I ordered the larger pan. Good purchase!"
Still got a few small burn marks that won’t scrub out
"My first purchase led me to get an additional set for my son & daughter-in-law. I'm very pleased with the quality of these products. Requires very little oil, food comes out great."
I will be purchasing more of these products.
It's a solid pan. I'll check back in a year on the durability.
We have had 6 months and these are best stick resistant pans we have ever had. Very easy to clean and cooks evenly. No Hot spots.
Very very non stick. Easy clean up. Cooks evenly. So far very nice.
Use for everything works great clean is great
These are exquisite!
Love this set. Amazing non stick coating - my fried eggs have never looked better!
I am absolutely in love with my set of pans. The cooking is so easy and cleaning the pans is even easier. I fried cheese and it slid right out of the pan.
Enjoyed the ease of cleaning. Very attractive in appearance.
None stick easy to clean
Buena relación precio-calidad
Super easy to clean!! Food cooks perfectly and nothing sticks to the pan.
Very easy to clean. Cooks food evenly.
Best pans. Very happy with this purchase
"These are great. I've been putting them in the dishwasher without any problems. The nonstick surface works well, and we like the glass covers. These are working out better than expected. Glad we got them."
"Beat pans I've ever had. So easy to clean, not a thinggg sticks to them."
"My wife’s wanted a replacement for her solid bottom pizza pans and these did the trick. Perfect crispy homemade pizza every time. Even great for reheating pizza, bread and other items for even heat. Easy to clean and largely nonstick. Good value happy with the product"
"These pizza pans are very nice. Pizza comes out of the oven nicely toasted. Works great for homemade or pre-made crust. Keeps oven clean, no need to put frozen pizza directly on oven rack. After I bought these I saw them cheaper at T.J. Maxx."
"I bought a set, and gave one to a friend. These are nice and sturdy. And I've used mine several times. And so has my friend."
I love making homemade pizza but the pizza stone would smoke every time we preheated it. These pans are perfect and the crust is nice and crispy.
They rust
"Crispy bottom and soft crust from my homemade dough. Much better than the stone we have tried,,,and so simple to clean and store."
Thought the dishwasher didn't cycle but it was rust water coming off the pans.
"I bake pizza at home quite often and this pan is excellent at getting a nice, crispy crust. No sticking either, even when I've shaped the raw pizza dough right on the pan. I have 2 of these pans and would definitely recommend them."
"Works great, nice and large!"
I like this pizza pan very much
"These pans easily accommodate a large pizza, which makes them more practical. Great wedding gift!"
"It looks really nice, has a nonstick coating to that works. The metal gets really soft in a hot oven and when you try to take it out it flexes around so much that it's like handling just the pizza. After it cools down it returns to a hard metal again. I do wonder if it's safe from contaminates leaking into my food with that drastic amount of change when heated."
"Wonder if this issafe, the pan releases an off metal smell while baking the pizza,"
perfect
Makes a great bottom crust on your pizza. I love it!! Will definitely buy again.
Works great nice crispy crust.
"I have tried stainless cookware many times, with zero success frying eggs. This is the smoothest surface I have ever seen on any frying pan, and I think that matters, I have seen tons of pros cooking eggs, I have never been able to master it though until now. Preheat the pan, get the butter bubbling and the pan at this point treats eggs as good or better than any nonstick frying pan (with butter) I have used. Plus the coating seems so very strong that there are no worries about using metal utensils. The Hestan brand cleaner is also the best stainless cleaner I have used."
This pan is very well built and very high quality. It is not non stick but maybe the special nano coating provides some benefit. I use it like a traditional stainless steel pan with oil and have another anodize aluminum pan when I need non stick. I got this pan for 50% off otherwise there are better options out there.
"This is an expensive skillet, but it is a piece of art and the silky smooth surface makes effective as a non-stick surface when used with a little bit of oil. The heating is very uniform across the whole skillet. I only wish it were less expensive and I would buy the smaller skillet too."
"Received the pan today. Beautiful/exquisite both in look and to the touch. Decided to really test the pans performance on day one. Made a great sausage and cream sauce. Created a fondant with Italian sausage then removed from the pan. Added shallots, peppers and garlic to build a thicker fondant. It lifted easily with the cream, 100% removed. Pan had a slight hazyness after cleaning, still smooth to the touch. Very happy and exceeds my All Clad in 1st test, time will tell if it holds up. Will try to update after a few months."
"Everything in the product description seems to be true to some degree. I don't have the equipment to verify that the heat distribution is in fact 35% better, but this pan seems to deliver better heating results than my anodized aluminum and other stainless clad cookware. Nanobond has a good balance between heat retention and heat responsiveness as well.  It has a lightweight construction, which can either be a virtue or a pain: Effortlessly dishing out pan sauces or food with one hand is a great convenience, but doing any hard stirring in the skillet causes it to shift around.  People tend to ask about stickiness and cleanup. To be clear, this is NOT a nonstick pan. It behaves much like stainless steel, but for those who are used to stainless, Nanobond is slightly less sticky. When it comes to cleanup, normal stainless steel practices apply. Once done cooking, pour some water into the skillet to let the browned/burnt bits release from the pan and during actual cleanup, acids like Bar Keeper's Friend or citric acid (literally citric acid, not lemons or anything - you can buy it from some grocery stores or right here on Amazon) can help. Also, for anyone complaining of the ""blueing"" tarnish of Nanobond after they clean it: sprinkle on some citric acid and wipe the surfaces with a wet sponge, and then wash with soapy water. And yes, you can put it in the dishwasher, but I'd never do it.  I think the only real drawback on Nanobond is the price. You can get similarly well-performing skillets for less than half the Nanobond price, and if you want luxury stainless clad cookware, it's around the same price. Still, if you're seriously wanting one out of curiosity and don't mind the extra cost, it's a lot of fun to use and I'd recommend giving it a shot.  Note: This is a unverified purchase because I bought my pieces elsewhere. I own the 11-inch and 12-inch skillets, the 3-quart soup pot, the 1.5-quart and 2-quart saucepans, and the 3-quart sauteuse."
"This pan is truly a piece of art. I saw the 12.5 inch pan for 75% off so I jumped on it because hestan nanobond has been on my radar for a long time. Although I can’t justify the usual cost, if you have the money to spend, choose this for sure. It’s nearly non stick and stunning overall."
easy to cook with
"Takes a bit skill to make it non-stick, basically it needs to be pre-heated thoroughly for about 2-3 mins. Then turn the gas to low if cooking things could over burnt like eggs. Even food sticks to it, you can clean all of them off just with a sponge right away. It is just great and can last you a long time. I had many other pans, cheap ones and more expensive ones, they all look and cook well at first but later the performance started to drop. But that's not the case with this hestan pan. The cooking becomes more and more enjoyable as you learn how to handle this pan properly. The experience gets better and better."
"Let me say to begin with, this is the first review I've done for Amazon - even after hundreds of purchases - this is the first review. The reason for this review is that I feel there is a dangerous flaw in the design of the handle. The pan itself is wonderful - cooks really well. It also has substantial weight for a frying pan. The handle is both extremely uncomfortable, and with the weight of the pan it is difficult to keep balanced when lifting off of a hot stove. Unless you have a very firm grip the pan can twist and actually dump what you're cooking. Also, the edges of the handle make it difficult to grip tight enough without causing pain. This is all really unfortunate because I love everything about this pan other than the handle. Other owners might disagree with this assessment - this is just my experience and I felt the potential of danger and burning was worth writing the review."
"Don’t bother buying this product. I got the 12 and the 10 inch nonstick skillet. Yeah they are nonstick and work great on my induction range. But the handles!!! There aren’t words to describe how much these handles suck. Want to lift the pan to pour the food into a container?! Break your wrist trying. Cramp your hand with the stupid concave design. The angle sucks, the shape sucks, and it makes handling these pans a nightmare. I don’t need $100 in 2 pans that I can’t lift without teaching my kids new cuss words. Keep shopping, and stay far away from this product."
"I’ve bought these pans 4 times. The first time was a gift and the recipient couldn’t stop bragging so I tried them. Wow! Amazing, but keep reading. I use them every day and I got a 2nd set because sometimes I have a lot going on at once, 2 sets would be better. Then my son bought a house and I bought the 4th set. The 4th time, I received a counterfeit set. They’re ABSOLUTELY NOT All-Clad. They didn’t come in an All-Clad box, didn’t have an extra handle on the 12 inch pan, and have thick handles like most brands. The pans aren’t large on the bottom like All-Clad. They are lightweight and have gentle sloping sides that start closer to the center like most pans. All-clad has straight sides that start all the way at the edge and allow a larger cooking surface. The seller for all 4 sets was Amazon. If you get a set that doesn’t come in an All-Clad box, and look exactly like the photos, with heft, straight sides, and thin handles, send them back."
"These are absolutely amazing! Worth every single penny. We eat a lot of eggs and I was so frustrated with how badly eggs stuck to the pan. Even the “non stick” pans. I was mad one morning, my eggs were ruined again, so I jumped on and bought these. I had head of the brand before but didn’t own anything from them and also didn’t care for the price, but I was desperate. These have changed my life. I love them. They are 100% worth it."
"All-Clad is simply the best non-stick cookware we have ever used. Not only does this pan feel like solid quality in both design and weight, it heats evenly and eggs will slide off the pan without oil. My wife always insisted we purchase the cheaper non-stick brands like Calphalon, Anolon, Red Copper, etc. since they go bad after a year or so anyway. Thus, we have tried many different brands and none have come even close to the ease of use and perfection of these pans. Last week, she accidentally left the stove on high with nothing in the pan for over an hour turning the center red hot from the electric grille. Normally, this would ruin the average frying pan, but not All-Clad. After cooling it and washing it normally, there was no indication whatsoever that it had been heated to that extreme. Our first All-Clad wok is finally seeing its age after +7 years of constant use, but still works splendidly. Spend the extra few dollars for the difference in quality! Highly recommended!"

These are the best non-stick pans I've ever used. Heavy pans with high sides so you can flip veggies while sauteing. Easy to clean. For years I've been buying throw away non stick skillets and replacing them yearly. Won't have to do that anymore.
"Excellent so far! I have a set of All-Clad stainless but my husband prefers non-stick so I bought these for him. Our very expensive Calphalon non-stick was in horrid condition. So, I tossed them and snuck these into the pots & pans drawer. He didn’t want to throw out the old pans because he’s frugal like that. I’ve noticed that he has used these but hasn’t commented on them. That must mean he loves them because if he had a complaint he would have voiced it loudly. His silence means I was right and we all know he’s not going to mention that. Let the Amazon review record show.... I WAS RIGHT. 😜"
"Although one of the pans have scratch at the back, I decided not to return it because for the price, it's already good. Yeah, reviews were quite right about the handle being odd and thinner but I just don't focus on that rather, the result of what I am cooking into the pans. So far so good! Real non-stick I might say."
So far so great! I love these pans! I had previously ordered the B1 12 inch frying pan and it never was really nonstick. It got worse and worse and after two years is completely useless. I am right now trying to see if All Clad is going to honor their warranty. I was a little hesitant to purchase these but the price seemed good and the reviews seemed better. I am so happy I did. I have been using these for a couple months now every day and they are living up to the name.
"These pans have to be a knock off of All Clad. I used these for 6 months. I'm throwing in the scrap metal pile today because the non stick surface is chipping off.  You may ask - ""well, did you use the right utensil?""  You bet. Never used steel or plastic tools. Always a silicon spatula or flipper.  I'm going stainless!"
"Says it will work on induction, won't work on my GE induction range top. Very disappointed."
"I have a number of all-clad pans. Never a complaint until now. These do not have the claimed flat bottoms. They are convex, and fat pools at the edges. I like low fat cooking but can't do it in these. I will probably return them."
"I almost didn't buy these because of the negative reviews regarding the handle comfort and the uneven pan surface. These reviews are NOT accurate. These pans are the best non stick pans I have ever used!  Im not sure if these reviewers are morons or competition but either way the negative reviews I have read do not apply to the pans I received which is what is pictured...lol.  I have dubbed these guys my miracle pans. Apparently there is cheap pan by that name and these are not them by brand but by function. Food actually is better in these pans mainly because of finished texture and the non stick aspect. Its hard to figure why but its just better somehow.  A little history for context -Have spent a couple decades doing elaborate cooking so I know the kitchen -Have used all manner of pans you can buy from the ridiculously expensive to the ultra cheap throw aways. -Was looking for a replacement to a crap ceramic coated pan I used to cook eggs in. -Really want non stick because Im very picky how my eggs come out. -I have been looking for a good egg pan for the same couple decades. -I had never found one till NOW! Amazing little miracle!  Just buy them they are the best non stick pan I have ever used. Probably tried 15 or so different types over the years and they all sucked in my humble opinion.  I have owned the stainless all clad for years, copper core and even their old non stick. Didn't really care for their old non stick.  First trial was over easy eggs with almost 0 oil just enough to season the pan. Result - Flawless over easy eggs that just slid right out after a little nudge from a silicone spoon.  The handle is standard All Clad and causes me no issues. I honestly cant believe the snowflakes leaving reviews if this handle causes them discomfort. Cant even see how it would be possible unless you held it upside down and tried to carry a couple cinderblocks with it.  Pan is perfectly flat and cooks amazingly evenly. Because of the physics of surface tension and the non stick part if you put fluid in the pan it will attract to itself around the outside ring of the pan. This has nothing to do with the pan but how incredibly nonstick it is. Im honestly shocked by some of the reviews I have read. Just makes you want to face palm.  Pans are awesome. I will be buying a backup set incase they stop making them. Will also be buying them as gifts cause they are that good.  Will post back if they suck after 6 months but right now they are amazing."
"I'm a big time cast iron snob, but sometimes you just need a nonstick. The nonstick is excellent and it doesn't seem like you are about to eat a bunch of chemicals either. Zero issues with frying/scrambling eggs. It's my go to for frittatas because you can do everything in one pan and even put it in the oven. It says dishwasher safe, but I haven't tried that. Frankly I haven't had to yet because clean up is usually a quick rinse under the sink with a little bit of soap and water."
"I've had two sets of these pans for over 3 years. They used to be more expensive than they are now but I'd gladly pay the same amount of money for the set of 2 pans again. They are the most non stick pan I've ever used and they continue to do an amazing job. I use the 10in for cooking meat and sautéing vegetables. You can use oil and I often do but just don't need it. I use the 8in for eggs and breakfast meats or for making a grilled sandwich. I only use silicon utensils. Any hard plastic utensils will scratch the coating. I wait for them to cool down, wipe them out with a damp paper towel or dish cloth and use a sponge with a bit of soap to wash. Don't use the scrubber side of the sponge though. They will last if you take extra care when using them and cleaning them. I don't use them every single day but I would say they still perform almost as well as the day I bought them. These particular ones are somewhat thick and heavy to lift with one hand but retain heat well. I've tried numerous other non stick pans and they all pale in comparison to the All Clad pans."
"My wife thinks they're a tad heavy, but she's a tad small and a tad weak (loves the gym but hates a heavy frying pan - go figure). These are SUPER easy to care for (rinse with warm/hot water while they're hot, wipe with paper towel and done), they cook AMAZINGLY well and nothing sticks. Burn something on it, and it doesn't hurt the pan and slides right out. Kid makes bacon, doesn't want to drain the fat and clean it, she'll leave it on the heat until I wander out in the morning, doesn't hurt the pan and I clean it right up. No scratches after a couple months of use. I would buy again. It would be nice to find: a) lids and b) a shallow version for omelettes, etc. These are nice pans."
"We've been hesitant to spend good money on new aluminum pans, especially online, worried about weight and quality. However, our old nonstick pans simply had to be replaced. America's Test Kitchen recommended the All-Clad stainless skillet for best overall features, but my husband's inexperience in the kitchen demanded nonstick. All-Clad's price for this set is actually doable (even competitive), so we went for it. Best. Decision. Possible.  We love these pans. They are nice and hefty, which allows for even heat distribution and less burning. They make perfect grilled cheese sandwiches with a uniform, crusty outside and melty goodness inside (fantastic temperature control), and cleanup's a snap, even with cheese spilling off the bread and all over the skillet surface. We were so happy with our choice, we went ahead and replaced our four-quart stock pot with an All-Clad of the same series.  A couple of notes: All-Clad's ads boast their ""made in USA"" status, but that only applies to their all- stainless products. The box for these aluminum, steel-bottom pans state clearly ""designed in the US, made in China."" This made us hesitant, but the quality couldn't be better. The box also assures the consumer they adhere to all US safety and health standards.  Next: a reviewer or two have complained about the uncomfortable handles. My husband agrees 100%. 'Vicious' is the word he uses. We did purchase All-Clad's silicone handle cover set, which sleeve is too loose for our pans. Not a big help. We're going to try a different brand. However, we do like that the handles are metal and so won't burn (an issue with my inexperienced husband). All things considered, we'll deal with the wonky handles because the pans themselves are so great.  Finally, we have a gas range, so we don't know how these pans will work on conduction or glass stove tops. They're perfect for gas, though.  One more thought: we only use wood utensils, and hand-wash (no dishwasher). We want these pans to last as long as possible. Since cleanup is such a breeze, this isn't an issue. To prevent scratches, we also don't stack them in the cupboard without surface protection between, such as a dishtowel or washcloth (or, you can spring for pricey inserts made for the purpose). Protecting our investment/ making it last longer is a no-brainer."
"I read about these pans on a “best non stick pans of 2021” kinda thing after getting much more expensive non stick pans last year. Those expensive pans failed so fast it was a joke, and despite the manufacturer’s warranty, they refused to replace them. We had Our Place pans, but some friend had the Caraway pans which they were equally displeased with. Both of those pans have “don’t cook above medium” restriction. So the mentality in ordering these all clad pans was primarily the price point vs high reviews.  These pans are SOOOOOO much better than the expensive junk from Our Place. They are rated much higher for acceptable temperature (including being oven safe- more on that in a moment)- so I’ve had to relearn how to cook with above medium heat. The non stick surface easily releases eggs without butter or oil (we still use a small amount of butter).  Regarding the oven safe comment- we have successfully used these in the oven. One of the comments I read were that the handles get hot. I haven’t had an issue with that on the stove top. But if it wasn’t obvious, the handles DO GET HOT in the oven. Even though I was extremely aware of this, I still accidentally touched the handle after removing the pan from the oven. It’s a mistake you’ll only make once.  We plan to replace our entire pot and pan set with these all clad pans."

"Will use All-Clad MC2 For all of our pots and sauce pans, But we like a non-stick type small pans for cooking eggs quickly with fast pan cleanup. We also use large cast iron skillets to cook vegetables as we need the iron added to our food and they hold the heat so great. But cast-iron is not a fast clean up process. We rejected the ceramic skillets because they cannot be used at high heat at all. This is our first use of this line of All-Clad. These work great as a nonstick skillet, they do very well cooking with eggs and anything really they are very easy and fast clean up. They are a very good value compared to MC2’s small skillet pans. Rating 5 stars = Love It."
"I’ve used many non stick pans through the years so I’m familiar with the way to care for them. These pans have a thicker coating than any Non stick or ceramic type pan I’ve used. They are hefty and I warn if you have dexterity issues you’ll find these pans heavy with or without food in them. I don’t find the handles to be a problem like some have mentioned and so far the non stick is fine. I do have some tips. make sure the pans are cool before washing, actually you should do that no matter what brand. Warm up the pan and cook on medium heat and of course use non metal cooking utensils. You want to see if your meat, chicken is done? Don’t cut into it in the pan. I don’t stick any non stick into the dishwasher period. I’ve done these things for years regardless of the brand name of the pans and I’ve been able to get longer life out of the pans."
"The high quality you get with All Clad shouldn't surprise me. But it always does. I've had their pots and pans for years. However I've never had their nonstick line. I can handle these two easily. They're not heavy on your wrists (which is an issue with me), the heat quickly and evenly. Also you can slide them into the oven, for final cooking. I've burned a lot of pans over the years. I think this one is going to out last me. If you were wondering if this would be okay, for a Mother's Day Gift. I would tell you it's perfect. It's not heavy, doesn't stick, (which makes it even more enjoyable)., it's oven capable and is perfect for a smooth top stove. There is mention regarding the handles. It's the exact same design used on all All Clad pots/pans/fryers. So for me, it was never an issue."
"I read all the reviews prior to purchasing these skillets. I purchased all new cookware, but the set I got did not have the 10 or 12 inch skillets--just an 8in and saute pan. I originally found a 'warehouse' deal and was sent the saucepans, not skillets. Then a second warehouse purchase had bad scratches on it and needed to be returned. However, I was able to see and feel the product and liked it a lot. I checked to see if the water pooled around the edges as reported in some reviews, and did not find that to be the case with the scratched skillets. But the scratches were bad and a deal breaker for me.  I was going to purchase the skillets sold open stock for my set and realized that the All-Clads were not that much more expensive, so I chose to purchase them at full price. Here's what I found: PROS: 1. The liquid in my set does not pool at the edges--the bottoms are definitely flat. 2. The handles are nice and you don't need an oven mitt to use them. 3. It definitely cooks faster and much more evenly than my old pans, which were of higher quality as well. 4. The clean up is a breeze. I am disabled, and really can't stand at a sink scrubbing pans. Using my spray nozzle, the pan completely washed out. I used soap anyway and rinsed again...but I really didn't need to. 5. This is not only beautiful, but solidly built pieces of cookware! It's very thick metal and the coating appears to be very sturdy--much more so than I have seen in all of my recent (in-store) searches of other brands. I don't think I will be needing to purchase fry pans again...and these will be passed down to my daughter.  CONS: 1. They ARE heavy!!! The helper handle on the 12inch is a must for me. I don't think this would be a good purchase for fragile seniors...it's just...too much. 2. Based on the scratches on the returned skillets, it was very evident that the scratches were caused by the 10in skillet being stacked on top of the 12 inch skillet. Perfect circular scratches fit the bottom of the 10in skillet. So DON'T STACK THEM!!! They do get deep gouges in the non-stick material.  Although I paid full price and would have wanted to get it on sale, etc., the price on Amazon could not be beat and in the end was a great deal for me. It's a great addition to my new cookware!"
"It's SO easy to clean, except that one time after I cooked something (meat or fish as I recall) there was a thin sticky residue on the inside on one side (where the side meets the bottom, more or less). The pan was only a few months old. Even after fully washing it multiple times, there was still some tackiness or friction when I slid my finger over that area, negating the non-stick properties. So I filled the (cold) pan with cooking oil and let it sit for awhile. (I put objects in the middle so I wouldn't need as much oil). I then washed it and it was as good as new.  That only happened once and I have 4 of these pans in various sizes. I've never put them in the dishwasher."
"I am surprised at how much research goes into buying pans or anything for the kitchen these days. After several weeks of a thorough research, trial and error, I chose these pans. I wanted the restaurant style sturdiness and quality without spending hundreds of dollars. I bought the two larger pans the 10 and 12-in and they and are exactly where I was wanting. High quality, even heat distribution and easy to clean. What a lot of research entailed for myself was using pans on a gas stove, since that's what I have. You'd be surprised how many people don't know how to use a gas stove . The flames are not supposed to engulf the bottom of the pan but centered directly under the bottom. If you do that, then you can typically use any pan out there, plus you won't ruin your handle. I've had no problems using these pans at high heat and they have not warped at all. Hope this helped. I only wrote this lengthy review because I did not see a lot of information about proper use of gas stoves and pans, just negative reviews of people burning the crap out of their pans or handles and blaming the pans. So one could say it could be both. But they also do not know how to properly use a gas stove so this review eliminates the latter."
"FAR superior to the All Clad stainless non-stick pans because these are so much cheaper and the quality is very high. These pans are heavy anodized aluminum with a solid non-stick finish. No matter what Alll Clad says, they will NOT warranty any non-stick pan for wear and tear. It won't happen - I know, I tried. So I'm done wasting the bucks on their stainless pans and have gone to these pans that are 1/3 the price when you catch a deal. I just chucked 5 older stainless non-stick All Clad pans because they were shot and I was NOT happy. So don't enable All Clad to seel expensive junk - buy these instead and when you have to chuck them, you saved 60%+ and lost NO discernible advantage over stainless."
"As a retired chef, I have always bought commercial stainless cookware including All-Clad, and Viking. All-Clad saute pans have always been a favorite of mine in the restaurant kitchen. We never used any type of non-stick at the restaurant because of the high heat used. I had one Cuisinart pan at home that my son gave me for Christmas one year, I never used it, but my wife does all the time...We were planning a brunch for our families and decided to do an omelet bar, and I needed to get a couple of non-stick pans to accomplish it. I was skeptical of these pans because of several reviews comments on the quality, and the price seemed low for All-Clad. But decided to go for them anyway...I purchased a set from the Amazon Warehouse and paid about $5.00 less for the set. received is great condition, in the original packaging, used them for our brunch, and love them, great weight, excellent finish, easy to clean, everything that you want in a non-stick pan."
"I recently purchased my second set of these fabulous frying pans as a house warming gift to my daughter (along with an Instant Pot, of course). These pans have good heft and make tossing veggies a breeze. I only grease the pans when I need to brown some foods, otherwise nothing sticks to these pans without grease. The handle are very comfortable and stay cool on cook tops. My daughter originally asked for a non stick pan with a red mystery coating. No way. Told her to stick with tried and true All Clad pans. She is thrilled."
"These pans are truly top of the line. I bought a set for my mother and, after seeing how good they were, a set for my sister. You simply won't find All-Clad anywhere else for this price, and they are worth every penny. I have cooked with them about 10 times now and have done fruit reductions, vegetables, milk sauces, etc. in them with no problems. They clean easily with soapy water. I haven't put them in the dishwasher, because there really isn't a need. The only two things to be careful of with these pans it the potential for them to scratch each when stacking (just use paper towel or the pot separators) and the weight of the pan if you are not used to heavier pans. Both issues are minimal when considering what you are getting for the price."
"I heavily researched the different types of nonstick materials before settling on hard anodized, then on the AllClad brand. It was time well spent. These pans are my new favorite thing in the kitchen!  I use one or the other, sometimes both, with nearly every meal I prepare. They heat evenly and quickly, the straight sides allow for a larger cooking surface, and nothing gets truly stuck on. They clean up perfectly with just a hot soapy sponge and water. No scrubbing at all.  They are a true nonstick pan. BUT the pans do flat-out fail the fried egg test. A little fat is needed to keep it from sticking. With no fat added, and using a spatula, I still had some sticking of my fried egg. (Side note: due to the straight sides, flipping your egg over easy would be quite difficult even with fat to aid you.) That said, I was able to make an omelet with no fat added to the pan, and no sticking occurred. The fried egg is just a tad too delicate, I suppose!  The surface inside and out appears extremely durable. I'm not going to use any metal utensils in them, period, although it is supposed to be safe if done correctly. I am taking no chances on these babies. I will be ordering new silicone utensils soon to replace some older ones. These pans will be the last skillets I buy!"
"OK, so the other reviewers are correct. The handles are super weird. However, these pans are outstanding in heat distributions and easy clean-up.  They are more delicate that I expected of this brand. It scratched somewhat when it came in contact with a metal spatula. It did not break through the coating, but it did scratch, it shocked me as the contact was brief.  At any rate, ignore the weird handles and use a silicone or wooden spatula, these pans are worth it!"
"I recently purchased a second set of these pans as I tired of having to wash/dry just to quickly reuse. I purchased the first set a year ago and other than the bottoms of those, due to repeated usage - look no different than the new set. The original set remains non-stick, no visible wear, cracking. I have used the first set no less than a dozen times a week, for a year. I followed all manufacturer instructions from seasoning them initially, to using only non-metal utensils, and while they say they are dishwasher safe, I hand washed them instead. I've zero complaints where these are concerned. The weight is perfect, they heat evenly and the price is just right. Others have commented on the poor handle design, I've not found them to be so. If I were to accidentally burn something up in them and render them useless, I'd definitely purchase another set. Also, the order was quick to ship, and they were well packaged and secure in the box so as not to move around. A definite five star all the way around for me, with ample usage and testing to comment with confidence."
"All-Clad is my favorite brand for pans and skillets. Gotta admit I was stunned to find this set at such a low price!  The pans are very sturdy, balanced, and VERY high quality. If I “had” to complain about something it would be that these skillets take longer to heat to temperature than my previous set of skillets which I bought on the cheap.  I understand why some would not like the style of the pans’ handles. The concave handle design is on the rest of my All Clad pieces so I’m used to them. The core of the pans conduct heat evenly and are nice and “weighty.” Non-stick coating works like a charm as my morning eggs slide right off. There is a “learning curve” as I am not used to the shape and depth of the pan itself. They are deeper than my previous set of skillets, but it sure was easy to get used to. Like the rest of my All Clad pans, these are now heirlooms!"
"Thinking about returning although I love all there is to love in a perfect skillet. . . .except the handle. It is narrow near the skillet and flares out being wider at the end. This design makes it difficult to carry a hot, full skillet because of the risk of keeping it from rotating, specially when using a pad or towel. The end of the handle is wide enough to keep it from turning but lifting is easy holding the handle right next to the skillet. I will keep the skillets. After further use and consideration I concluded the skillets are the best I've found in that price range: Non-stick feature works great while cooking and during dishwashing. The heat distribution is dependable along with heat retention. I've adjusted to the design of the handle so all is well."
"This is one of purchases I made from our vacation rental home. The condo had these one, they’re incredible non-stick, go right in the dishwasher, and are not scratching at all. We are tough on our non-stick pans!! I use them multiple times every day and they’re washed in dishwasher every day, without fail. Tough as nails, a GREAT purchase for us!"
"This is the second time I have purchased these fry pans from Amazon. Hardly a day goes by that we don't use at least one of them, and often we use both, so of course they do show some wear. I will say that the 10"" skillet is a bit lighter than the older one: 2 lbs. 11 oz. vs. 3 lbs. The 12"" one weighs 3 lbs., the same as the older one. My only problem with them is that the handles are uncomfortable for me to pick up because of their shape and the weight of the skillets, especially when they have food in them. My old Anolon ware had much more comfortable handles."
"These skillets are worth the money. They are heavy, not like cast iron, and can be used on glass cooktops without scratching the surface. They are also compatible with induction cooktops. We bought the non-stick version and have good luck with them so far. As a precaution I’ve eliminated any metal utensils that might be used on them. The handles don’t get hot and there isn’t as much grease splatter as the skillets with the rolled edges. They make stainless versions that I’d be willing to try when these wear out."
"The HA1 series is the way to go. Very sturdy construction and the Teflon costing is superior to calaphon which I have used for years but have seemed to be getting cheaper through the years. I am not thrilled with the shape of the handle but it’s ok, a bit too much angle. Would have preferred straighter. So far so good. I will probably switch over to this brand as my older cookware needs replacement. This is more expensive than Calphalon which now seems to always be discounted by 30%."
"I don't expect non-stick pans to last forever but these died quickly. The real problem is All-Clad's customer support. I know how to use a non-stick pan, med-low to low heat, silicone utensils, no dishwasher(even though they say you can put these in the dishwasher, DON'T). After less than 4 months of use the non-stick coating on the small pan started to flake off. I reached out to A-C and sent pictures They immediately replied that the pan would not be covered because the damage had come from over heating the pan. I replied that this pan had never been overheated. They replied that it was likely due to over heating and they could see a few faint scratches in the coating so it was normal wear and tear. I replied that I had an online presence with over 300K followers (not true) and I would be detailing my experiences. They replied that they would send me a new pan. Customers should not be blown off, told that they have done something wrong and have to lie and give so much push back for a company to stand behind its product. I was really surprised and disappointed. I had a Caphalon pan that was over 15 years old that began to warp. Calphalon sent a new one with no questions asked."
"These are, hands down, my favorite non-stick pans. They’re heavy and the handle is firm. So well made. I have been wanting to invest in an All-Clad set, as lost people will tell you it is the best brand for pots and pans. I find the stainless steel ones amazing, but incredibly expensive. When I saw this set, I decided to try them out. The smaller one is perfect for a 2-egg omelette, while the larger one fits a dish for 4-6 persons. The one thing I would LOVE would be for them to come with lids. I find myself using other pans’ lids to cover these, but they are ill fitting. In all, definitely worth it. I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand."
"Considering it is not easy to find good quality pans that work well on induction surfaces, I am pleased these pans are terrific in that regard. Rinse and wipe with paper towel usually does the cleaning trick. On occasion I use a sponge. Good idea is to remove most of the surface with a paper towel before using a sponge. After six months, still look like new and perform as well!"
"I'm not exactly skilled in the Culinary Arts, but my partner is, and while she loves the All-Clad D5 Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set we recently purchased, she informed me it's always good to have at least a few non-stick pans in any collection. I love these, especially the fact that they're dishwasher safe. She says they're a bit heavy, just like the Stainless Steel set, but to me that just means they're well built. Highly recommend."
"I don't know why anyone would buy any other brand. It's because they are like me, I had no idea these were so freakin' good. Now that I know I would pay twice the price for these. I didn't know a pan over a gas flame could heat so evenly. Big pancakes are golden brown the entire surface. I don't use oil so eggs stick a bit but it comes off in dishwasher. Which is another bonus, you aren't typically suppose to put such pans in a dishwasher. Big bonus, U.S. made and lifetime warranty. I wish you could buy a lid for the 8"". I wrote All-Clad and told them they should include lids for the pan set. They said the are for cooking without a lid yet they make a lid for the 10"" and 12"". Kinda of a lame response. They could have just responded they would take it under consideration and do nothing."
"I have used these pans several times a day, every day for 10 months. They cook great, clean great but do scratch. Very careful, only use nylon utensils and never use high heat. They do have some scratches, but hold up much better than other non-stick pans which only lasted 6-momnths with constant use. I've read other reviews about the handles, but I honestly have never had a problem with the handles. The seem to be fine. All in all, they do cook great, worth the $100 and I would buy them again."
"It's been hard finding nonstick fry pans for our induction range. We'd been using inexpensive but useful ones from a Swedish chain, but the coating kept coming after a year's use and we had to replace them. These from Calphalon were twice the price we'd paid, but the tradeoff was two pans instead of one, which helped. These are a bit oversized, heavy, and substantial, and I doubt the coating will come off for a very log time. We use them frequently, doing about 90% of our high heat cooking with them. Not only do they work really well, but they clean right up."
"I only use good cookware for years and I had to replace a some older pans from All-Clad (about 15 years old) and some others that did not last very long. I was concerned as these All-Clad pans are made in China, but I tried them, the coating seems to be better than on many older pans. BUT NEVER use metal inside! The only dis-advantage is that they do not seem to brown well, I use therefore butter when making eggs. Please also note that the smaller pan (10"") fits well on the stove (I currently have an electric stove) where usually 12"" pans fits. Therefore the small one is a good value also. The quality on the high-end 14"" pan I have from All-Clad looks better, but these cheaper ones are probably better than 95% of the pans on the market. A definite buy. Please note that they stay flat on an electric cooktop and do not wobble around!"
"I'm a single guy who has survived on microwave meals for most of my adult life. I decided it was time to grow up at 49 and start cooking real food. These pans were defiantly an upgrade from my dollar store pans. They feel solid and heat well. The handle can dig into you hand a little when you lift it if the pan is full of food but not a deal breaker for me. The non-stick coating seems thick and durable. Easy to clean, most of the time they wipe clean with a paper towel."
"Tired of lousy nonstick on lousy pans……granted the handles are not the ones I would have put on these pans but they certainly are not a deal breaker…I’m an 81 year old woman and I can lift and use them easily. The pans are wonderful and their design superior, already love them……I even bought a top set of stainless steal ceramic non sticks (not) and hated them…..everything stuck. These are the nicest non sticks I’ve bought and the price was amazing….look forward to lots of easy cooking in these pans…thanks, all-clad!"
"These pans are worth every penny. If you are looking for a good set of nonstick pans, look no further! I had recently purchased two Tfal pans to replace two nonstick Ikea pans. However, I came across these after a friend had purchased them and LOVED them. She cooks frequently, so I take her recommendations seriously. To add, I enjoy cooking as well and I am striving to make the perfect omelet, traditionally French. In looking to see what pans are best to make the perfect omelet, these appeared in an article online. Now there were two reasons for me to purchase these pans! The heat distribution and non-stick quality matched the durability that All Clad is well known for. I could not be happier."
"I bought these for my new induction stove. Usually I end up with a $20 or so non-stick pan, so these were an upgrade. However, they are built to last. Very heavy construction (not too heavy however for lifting- just much more solid than the commonly sold mass market nonstick pans). Overall, it has held up incredibly well with no damage or scratches to the non-stick surface. Most importantly, I have found these combined with induction make cooking certain items like eggs incredible easy with the best results I've ever seen. My only complaint would be the handle which is not comfortable to hold but that's ok because I rarely need to use the handle. Overall highly recommended."
"I feel like I got the deal of the century. Two All Clad pants for $60? Still not sure that was right... anyway, they are a dream AND work with my induction stove top.  It seems like NOTHING burns! Maybe it's just my imagination, but wow. Food is just better."
"These are great. I got three non-stick skillets at a big name club store for about the same price. The one I used the most (6-7 times a month) chipped within a few months. I use the correct spatulas and turners, but still none seem to last. The All-Clad are better in every way. Yeah, there are only two instead of three, but still a better value. They are more substantial, the handles are better and they heat better. The food comes out beautiful because it's so even. And THEY ARE MADE IN THE U.S.A. Great stuff."
"I recently bought a 14 piece All Clad Copper Core set, those are not non-stick. I wanted a couple non-stick pans to go with the set for some of the tricker items like eggs and pancakes. I've had these for 2 months and have used them multiple times a week on a gas stove. Heavy weight might be too much for my granny but I am glad to have them. I might buy my mother a set."
"I've always used cast iron pans by Lodge. They're fine but these are so much better, why didn't I get them sooner ? The heat distribution is excellent so my grilled cheese sandwiches brown evenly. A lot of reviewers complained about the handles but I don't have a problem with them and they are long because in a restaurant the stove top would be large. The real payoff is the clean up which is a cinch especially compared to cast iron. Highly recommended."
"I am satisfied with the product at this time. Time will tell if they are superior to others. I have learned a few trics to preserving my frying pans with time. So if they endure my cooking, I shall be very please. Up until now, I am very happy with their performance. I have learned not to rinse them while they are hot. That is how I ruined my other pans. On a flat surface stove, that is the worse thing to do. Thank you!"
"I always bought cheap T-fal type cookware. I bought All-Clad because it was recommended on an NPR cooking show's website, and they're usually pretty objective. The first time I cooked with these pans I IMMEDIATELY noticed the difference: the weight and quality feel of the pans, the way the oil beaded up when drizzled in the pan (and the oil stayed that way!). But most notably, how the chicken I cooked just slid around in the pan, without any adhesion regardless of how long it seared. Do yourself a favor - get these and throw away that cheap stuff!!!!"
"I love to cook and I own or have owned many of the reliable brands, both, Le Crueset, Calaphon, Circulon, Farberwear (old Farberwear), fancy french copper, Revere and Lodge; girlfriend has Henckels, Revere, Wearever and (also) ""The Green Pan"". We both have tried many of the cheap brands too. So far the non-stick surface on the All Clad pan has lasted far longer than the other Teflons and ceramics. Our pans get daily use and we are convinced that they will last longer than any pans we have owned. We also recommend the All Clad oven mitts. We purchased those after I got a serious burn while using mitts produced by another famous kitchen product manufacturer."
I like these very much. I have a number of random quality pots and pans with all clad being my absolutely favorite even over ones that cost twice as much and all clad isn’t cheap. These are great non stick pans and work great. BUT i am updating now to reflect the issue with the handle. They are using the same handle used for sauce pans that work so great but do not work great on a larger sauté pan. I love this style handle on my all clad saucepans but do not care for it on this product. I was looking to purchase a larger one but will not purchase this handle because it is not user friendly and is uncomfortable to use.
"The All-Clad is made in America and the quality is second-to-none. I have French made Cuisinart and the All-Clad is every bit as good. Far superior to China made Cuisinart.  The 4 quart sautés pan is the pan I have always wanted. The sides are high enough to keep food in the pan. You can flip the contents without finding food all over the cooktop.  This pan can cook a full meal in the same pan (sautés, fry and stovetop cook). If you start filling it with a lot of liquids, it can get a bit heavy.  Overall, this is a heavy duty pan that can handle sautéing without things slipping onto the stovetop or floor."
"I like everything about these pans. However, there are two features you should be aware of before you buy them. These pans have high sides, not sloping sides. This makes them useful for cooking dishes that might require that height on the side, but it's a bit awkward if what you want to do is slide the food off the pan, like an omelet. Not a big deal at all, but something to be aware of.  Also, although they say you can wash these in dishwasher they don't recommend you do so. So, to me, that means don't wash them in the dishwasher.  Neither of these caveats bother me, but you should be aware of them before you buy."
"I am amazed by the negative reviews. I almost think they are intentional.  These are the best non-stick pans I have ever owned, hands down, no competition. They distribute heat amazingly well and they are thick and solid. These are beyond spectacular and this was the greatest deal I ever got in my life.  Do not listen to the negative reviews. These are amazing."
"Like the pans weight . however my eggs still stick. I use a small amount of olive rub into the pan before cooking. when I flip the eggs no problem after the other side is cooked when I try to remove the eggs from the pan it is stuck to the surface. of the pan. What am I doing wrong? Other reviews state eggs glide out of the pan .This is definitely not happen when I cook eggs, what am I doing incorrectly?"
"I'm on my second set of these and still love them. I even bought a set for my dad. The 8"" and 10"" sizes are perfect for two people. They're heavy enough to heat evenly without warping and I can put them in the oven to finish proteins if I need to. As with all nonstick pans, they have a limited lifespan, but the nonstick is quite good and they're easy to clean. I'll probably buy these again when it's time to replace the current set."
"So much better than any other pan I've had. Even beats out my cast iron with it's heat distribution/non-stick combo. I can use so much less heat on each burn since it distributes so well, and that gives me far more control over the overall cooking temperature. The non-stick is perfect so far, eggs float on it, steaks sear perfectly. I did find it easy to burn things at first due to how much hotter it gets, but got use to that quickly. Expect to turn you element down a bit with these."
"Cooks evenly. Extremely easy cleanup. All Clad delivers a high quality, sturdy, well engineered product. Appreciate the “starter” nature of this item - two sizes for a terrific price, which as designed makes me inclined to want to purchase the entire set! I will say the non stick interior doesn’t last forever. We bought a pack of these a year ago and the interior developed some build up and they became more difficult to clean - even with following care instructions and using appropriate non metal cooking utensils. Ok"
"Awesome product for anyone with induction or electric stove tops! I typically hand wash these but haven’t had any troubles with putting them through the dishwasher, there’s been minimal wear and tear and no noticeable scratches. Maybe a few minor chips near the edges, but I’ve owned them for close to a year, so that’s to be expected with 4-5 days a week of use. I use wood or silicone and occasionally a wire whisk and haven’t seen any marks from using that for the occasional omelet. I highly recommend anything from All-Clad!"
"LOVE these! I have been researching healthy non-stick cook wear for a VERY long time! I have had the same pots for over 20 years, which is probably not the best idea. I don't even have to use oil with these, but I do just to make sure the surface stays nice and smooth. I do have to agree with some reviewers that these pans are SO non-stick that it makes it difficult to flip over your eggs. You will understand once you try it for yourself.  The whole pan, including the handle, feels strong and sturdy but easy to use. I have a glasstop stove and was nervous about having something a bit on the heavy side on the top, but these have posed no problem whatsoever. No scratches on my glass from them either. I am very picky when it comes to a long-term investment such as cookwear, and I couldn't be happier with this set!"
"Love those! Heavy bottoms (the way I like it) resulting in even heat up, very stable on the electric stove. Also non stick (don't use metal utensils, don't wash them in the dishwasher). Very easy to clean, mostly requires rinsing and paper towel wiping.  One inconvenience is the shape of the handles. They are half empty entire length (probably to save up materials and reduce the overall weight) but the edges can really wedge into your palm. But this is the inconvenience I'm willing to endure for the sake of value of money for this product."
I have had several different frying pans through the years and I have to say these are the best that I have had I've had that good luck since I bought them nothing sticks perfect eggs a friend recommended them thank God for that
I am so pissed! This set is an overpriced cheap piece of crap. The bottom of the pan completely melted through ruining not only the pan but my stove top as well!
"I waited a while to write this review because I'd had other enamel cookware before (a different brand) that I initially loved, but as I used it, it quickly became very scorched looking on the bottom. Since I display my cookware on hooks in my kitchen, this was very unsightly. Well, I've been cooking with my beautiful Rachael Ray Agave Blue enamel cookware for nearly four months and it's still as lovely as the day I took it out of the box. It's as functional as it is beautiful. I highly recommend the cookware and will buy more in the future."
"I have had this cookware set for about a year and a half now. I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with how well they've held up given some of the reviews saying they were garbage within 3 months. Many of the reviewers stated that they used and cleaned them properly, but still had issues with staining, fading, chipping, or exploding lids, etc. Mine have a little wear and tear, which I'd expect, after a year and a half, but the color has not faded at all, the Teflon is still unscratched, isn't peeling, is basically like new. I always hand wash with hot water and use dawn soap with a non-abrasive sponge. I only use coated, silicone or wood spoons, whisks, etc. And, I use the right size pot for the right size burner (gas stove). This makes a BIG difference. Honestly, I'd never really thought about it before, but it mentions this in the care instructions. If you let flames shoot up the sides of the pot you're going to get discoloration or browning on the bottom and/or edges. I've seen that in previous sets I've owned, but didn't realize that was the cause. So, with this set, I've been careful to not let that happen and its worked! Thankfully, I have not had a lid explode on me as some others have experienced. I'm crossing my fingers that doesn't happen, but so far so good! Overall, I'm really happy with this set of cookware. I included some photos of the ones I use on a daily basis. So, I don't know.... I don't want to say that others didn't use or care for theirs properly; maybe they did get a ""lemon"" set or something, but mine look and work great after a year and a half! I highly recommend."
"I haven't even had this set for a year and I am ready to toss it out! I received for my birthday in November 2017 and it is completely stained on the out side. We hand wash them so that the color won't fade, but the quality is so poor. I wish I could return the whole set and get our money back. Really disappointed, not sure how Rachael Ray allows her name to be added to such a cheaply made item."
Initially I loved this set. I never put in the dish washer and took very good care of it. Pieces of the inside of the pot was found inside of my food. I had to throw away 3 pieces. Beautiful color but I can't have pieces of pot and pans in my food.
"Wife enjoyed them. I scratched one cutting pork chops in the actual pan.... Don't do that, for the love of all that's holy."
"Had these for about 2 years. The first few months I was pleased. Only use the utensils it came with. Had to throw away one pan after a year because the non stick coating is peeling, Incase you didn’t know, that can transfer chemicals into your food. I’m not about that life. I cook every day twice a day and for the most part they work. Even though they are non stick I still have learned to use non stick oil which you generally are advised against. The color never faded on mine like some, I use gas stove. Idk For the price not the best. Saving up for something better. Edited to add. This EXACT set with a new face sells at Walmart for much cheaper. That is IRRITATAING"
"This weekend, under normal use, while on a pan of simmering pasta, I went to pick up the lid and the handle came off in my hand and the glass lied exploded. I had shards of glass in my hand, all over my kitchen, and who know how long I'll be finding them."
"DO NOT BUY THESE PANS!!!! These pans are okay, the color faded and the enamel lost its luster after two months use. Update on these horrible pans, no luster or shine, lids no longer fit, pans are warped. THE WORST PANS I HAVE EVER OWNED."
"Amazing set... great quality this is my 2 set after 4 Years. I just wanted a different color. Like everything if you take good care will last forever. Do not use metal on the pots i wash then by hand, (I do not have gas stove ) i saw pictures of this item and a terrible condition I WONDER HOW THIS ITEM GET LIKE THIS... CUSTOMER BROKEN LIDS THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF YOU DROP IT AND NOT EVEN .I HONESTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A GREAT SET A GOOD BRAND I USED MY FAMILY USE IT WE NEVER HAD ANY OF THIS INSANE ISSUES. PLEASE FOR EVERYONE THAT READS MY REVIEW ( IF YOU DON TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE ITEM YOU PURCHASE PLEASE DO NOT POST PICTURES OR LEAVE BAD REVIEWS, IF NOT FAIR TO THE BRAND AND OTHER CUSTOMERS, BE HONEST PLEASE ,IS NO WAY THIS ITEM CAN GET IN A TERRIBLE CONDITION UNLESS IS INTENTIONALLY. THANKS"
"I’ve had this set since 2015 and it’s atill holding up despite having a husband who doesn’t take proper care of them. As long as you don’t use metal utensils while cooking and wash by hand, I’m sure they’ll last a lifetime. However, even with my husband using metal spatulas and mixing his macaroni with a FORK and running these through the dish washer, they’re still in good shape with minor damage. However, DO NOT DROP THEM. I dropped the large skillet from the counter on the floor and it dented the side in so the lid doesn’t fit right."
"I have always used cheaper sets which worked pretty okay, but didn't hold up very long and didn't always cook evenly. This set is durable, easy to clean (nothing sticks, burns onto it, and liquids bead right off), heat seems to distribute evenly, and the variety of sizes in the set accommodates anything I am cooking. I will have to wait and see how long they hold up, but so far I am a fan!!!  UPDATE: I've had these almost a year and they are remarkable!! One did get scratched easily and the company fixed the issue immediately! This is the best purchase I have ever made!!!"
"I’ve had these well over a month so far and I am impressed. I’ve tried pioneer women twice and they were awful, so I was unsure about buying a new set online. They distribute heat REALLY well, and are so easy to wash. They don’t show any wear and tear despite my husband using metal silverware to cook a few times without thinking. I put one or two pots/pans in the dishwasher daily, and it hasn’t effected them so far. Besides having cast iron, I recommend these for the ease of daily use/cleaning."
"Asked her what she would like. She said tephlon cookware. Then asked specifically for a set of Rachael Ray purple cookware with a set silicon utensils to accompany it. She's had them for nearly a year. I asked her how they were holding up for her last week as I was looking to buy a cookware set of my own. She said that she hasn't had any issues with them but, that if I were to buy them I need to make sure to use silicon utensils so I don't scratch the coating off of the inside of the pans."
"This rating is strictly based on appearance. We received this cookware set this past weekend and upon opening, we discovered that the stock pot was significantly dented. I filed a warranty claim and the woman I spoke with stated this item was no longer in stock but would be replaced with a similar item. I'm a little bummed about that but don't feel like repacking the entire set and returning. As for the appearance of the remaining set it looks really nice. My husband even commented on how good the set looked. We purchased the sea salt grey. I'll update this review after a few weeks of use."
"I love this set!!! The photo I attached is what we used for dinner last night and not the complete set. It came with a spoon and spatula which are wonderful! I didn’t really care about those when I ordered it but am really happy with them. The pans are heavy enough but not too heavy. The grips stay cool and are comfortable. They clean so easily! We’ve made an entire box of pasta in the large pot no problem. The small pot has been used for ramen, simple syrup and is perfect for melting butter for baking.The medium is perfect for rice. My son has complained that the medium sized skillet isn’t big enough, but I easily made pancakes and basted 4 eggs. We did a kitchen remodel and I decided to get rid of all my old pots and pans and have only this set. I’m soooooo glad I did. I got the gray color and it’s quite nice. The interior is gray/brown and I kinda like that too. Seriously. Gift yourself."
"I have previously owned very heavy Calphalon ...the were great, but expensive. From Macy's. I finally need new ones. I got sucked into the pretty shiny stainless ones on Amazon on Black Friday. Mistake...they were a big pain to keep clean. Pretty yes, functional no. Then THESE came along. I adore them. They are so pretty and the clean up is a breeze. Highly recommend them. I received joy just SEEING these on the stove."
"I purchased this cookware set because I had purchased a new stove. This set was recommended because the stove is a ceramic cook top. The set is well made and washes up easily after use. I made a strawberry reduction and had some stick to the bottom of the pan, came right off with warm water and dishwashing liquid. I like the fact that you can order different colors as well. The set has pots with various sizes and lids and has 2 nonstick skillets with 2 utensils. The food cooks quickly and uniformly. I would definitely recommend this cookware set, great value for the money, quick shipping, and works as advertised."
"I've been using hand-me-down Teflon pans for a long time, so these were a special gift to myself. Most of these were a little smaller than what I expected, but I didn't exactly bother to pull out a tape measure when I ordered. Just be aware that the largest frying pan is pretty shallow and not very big compared to a typical frying pan (at least I don't think so), and maybe use that for scale when deciding which set to buy. The deep pan with the lid has actually become my favorite cooking vessel in lieu of a frying pan because of the lid is great when cooking with oil! Stove top and counters stay splatter-free.  Overall, I'm very happy with the quality of these. They have a great non-stick coating that also makes them easy to clean. I haven't had issues with discoloration or the coating burning/scraping off the bottom, but I'm very careful with them, and I hand wash the bottoms after every use. Also worth noting that the color was true, compared to the product images. I'm a lover of all things teal, so I ordered the Agave Blue, and it goes well with my teal-accented kitchen. It is a more subdued color on the darker end of the teal spectrum, so don't expect the typical bright, vibrant turquoise of most teal kitchen accessories. The two included utensils are also excellent quality. They are not cheap or bendy plastic!  I'm going to try to keep these shiny and new for as long as I can. I would definitely buy more Rachel Ray products after this."
"My mother purchased my a set of Pioneer Woman cookware for my birthday, but after looking at reviews online, I decided that I would wanted something with better quality. After reading tons of reviews, I decided to order these Rachael Ray pots and pans, and I'm so glad I did.  I've been using them daily for about three months now, and they all look as good as new. I only sue wooden utensils or the utensils that came with the set, so as to avoid scratching them. So far, they don't have a scratch. They seem to heat up quickly and evenly, and the set has a great variety of sizes.  I highly recommend this set for anyone who wants quality cookware that is cute and won't break the bank!"
"I bought these over 3 years ago and they appl work great. The color faded due to putting them in the dishwasher, teenagers being lazy. They clean very very easy. No need to put then in the dishwasher. I actually left the pot on the stove set on low all night with tea and sugar, woke up to a hard candy coated pot. Added water to soak and the pot was still im perfect condition. Highly recommended"
I just opened my set and the large skillet had a dent in it! This is my third set of her cookware and I have never had an issue. I would have returned the whole set but I had company coming and I needed to use it as I gave my old set to my daughter I was disappointed but I guess things happen. Even with this experience I will most likely by her cookware again.
"I received this set of Rachael Ray Cookware for Christmas. I absolutely love the way it cooks all my meals, evenly, and perfectly.The set is very well made, to last. I am not a chef by no means, but this set makes me feel like I am. It has really brought out the cook in me. Comes with glass lids, with special handles that really grip. They are soft and forms to your hand for easy lift. The pots and pans have extra long handles as well, to hold, ease of carrying place to place. Easy to wash. I hand wash mine. And it came in a beautiful purple color which is my favorite. So perfect for my whole family. We use them every meal, everyday and absolutely love to cook now. Highly recommended. Excellent value."

"I bought these as an Amazon warehouse deal, and after getting them I think $150 is way overpriced. However, for what I paid I'm satisfied. I had realistic expectations and knew I wasn't getting professional quality pans. The color is beautiful and just what I wanted for my new kitchen. I have only been using them for a month but so far no chipping, stains, or melting. I noticed others had issues with those things but maybe it depends on your cooktop? I have coil burners so maybe They work best on that style, idk. They are truly nonstick which I love. If things change I will update but so far so good!"
Rachael Ray’s pots and pans are great. Follow directions they gave you. Wash them in warm water and when you get ready to use them heat the pan up first on medium heat before putting anything in it. Don’t ever cook any of your food in those pans or any pan on high heat. When you’re done cooking don’t put a hot pan in water. Let it cool down naturally. This is how you should treat any kinds of pots and pans. Should I use metal utensils. Yesterday I made bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches. I love the way except of the bacon. Sometimes bacon curls up and it doesn’t and these pans. Cook on medium heat always

Originally had the teal when we had a gas stove. They cooked well but the outside blackened. We got the gray set when we swapped over to electric & they cook great and still look great! Love these!
"It has been about 3 months since I have bought them and there have been no issues with the non-stick coating. I do not use a dish washer to wash them. I had scrub them with a normal non-scratch sponges. My girlfriend and I both agree the heat distribution is very good and cooks evenly.  I chose the Lavender set for one main reason. After looking at all the reviews, it seems majority of the complaints are from those that purchased Teal, Red, and Orange. Not saying correlation is causation but there are almost no negative reviews from users that bought Lavender."
"I love the color. It was exactly what I hoped for and goes well with my kitchen decor. The pots are just the right size for all of my cooking needs. They clean very easily and work so much better then my regular stainless steal pots on my gas stove. I did all of the research i required to ensure I was purchasing the right type of pans for a gas stove and these have been great. The only thing I notified after one month of use is that the red paint of the pot began rubbing off on the grate when I shuffled the pot back and forth while preparing a meal. It wasn’t obvious when I looked at the pan itself, and it cleaned up right away from the grate, but I wonder whether this will continue. Nonetheless, so far so good."
"This set of pans not only looks beautiful hanging in the kitchen, but also makes cooking a breeze. I cook no less than 3 times a day in my kitchen every single day and this set has held up very well. I even love the included utensils and use them all the time. This is common sense, but don't use anything too abrasive to clean the outside as you can easily damage the finish."
"Love this set! I have Rachael Ray pots and pans and when my son was getting his first home, I got him this to matches Decour. His kitchen is gray and he loves the color red. This is amazing and I was able to get all the pieces he needs as he is a cook who graduated in culinary school. He’s very particular about his pots and pans and has been very happy with this. Designed very well. Great value great color."
We bought these pots and pans because we just bought a new glass top stove that recommended using pots and pans with a flat surface. We are pleased with them so far. I really like the depth of the pots and pans to. All of them are deeper than any standard pot or pan set I’ve ever owned and I’m finding this to be quite useful. I went outside my comfort zone and purchased the color purple and I’m so happy that I did.
My husband got these for me for Christmas. I absolutely LOVE them. They’re the easiest pans To clean that I have. It’s wildly satisfying to accidentally burn something and then get to clean the pan off. It just comes off so well. I love the various sizes. I literally use every single one of them without any complaints. Just be sure to not use any metal utensils while cooking.
"Have had this set for a while now and can safely say that they are great. Have had no problems with cleaning them. I do not put in the dishwasher because they simply wipe clean after use. Purchased some silicon utensils so as not to scratch the surface when stirring while cooking and have had no trouble. They are still bright and shiny and have not had any scratches, stains or burn spots. I use them almost daily. Previously had ceramic coated pots and pans from another brand and was disappointed that the ceramic finish discolored easily and eventually lost its no stick feature. So far these have continued to be just as when they were new."
I've been dying for this set since I first laid my eyes on it and it did not disappoint. The purple is a little darker than the picture though which I totally wanted so I was in love. They dropped the price of it down by $50 at one point so the minute I saw that I HAD TO HAVE IT!! It is very non stick and the perfect family size. I haven't yet tried it the dishwasher so lets hope that works out!
"This is our second set. The first set was lost by our movers (I think one of them took them home to the wife). Was probably the most disappointing thing lost in the move. They also lost our 55"" T.V. this loss was worse. Bought a new set and will carry these in the car if we move again. You seriously must look at this set if you are looking for pan set. If they ever add a flat cast iron skillet to the set it would be one stop shopping for a novice cook. Better then the Pioneer Woman set our friend has."
"I brought this as a gift and my sister love love it, she said it the best pot and pan set she every owned. She left a pot on the stove for about 2 hours with only 8 oz.. of water and the pot didnt even burn or smoke.up the house no damage at all inside.or outside of the pot. She was amazed no damage at all. She really loved this set. I'm thinking of buying a set for myself. Great product"
"My husband bought this set, a different color years ago for Christmas. We use them everyday and they have held up so good. I saw these on sale again and hade a coupon code so I bought the set again. The old set got moved into the camper. You won't be disappointed. Get them! I don't use the utensil much."
"I DO love my pots and pans. They are easy to clean. I was aware of all the previous reviews and the defects that it would bring so I wouldn't be upset. Reading the previous reviews before purchase, I KNEW the set might come slightly bent or the covers won't fit correctly or that the color may be darker, so when those things actually came that way, I wasn't totally upset. It doesn't stop e from using it and I love the way my rice doesn't stick at ALL! The color overall still matches my kitchen and I love them overall. I agree with others however, about the improvement the manufacturer needs to make on the product. COLOR IS A BIT DULLER THAN THE PICTURES."
"Nothin sticks to these pans! I've fried eggs, made stir fry, and pancakes. Everything slides off with ease. I see why everyone has only good things to say. The utensils are handy and there are a wide variety of different pan sizes. I feel like these will last a very long time."
"A great essentials cookware set for my home. Easy to clean, cooks food evenly and just happy to use them. I got my set in the Mushroom Brown, it’s really beautiful and goes with my kitchen backsplash. The nylon utensils are OK, would’ve been fine without them. I don’t recommend leaving them the pots/pan, just don’t do it and the nylon won’t chip at all. The handles on the biggest pot do get hot, not really heat resistant. Still really happy with my purchase."
It’s truly nonstick. I got the purple and am in love. I’ve used the whole set many times now. Easy to clean and cooks beautifully!! Even had no trouble in the oven. I wish it came with a 2 quart saucepan. Couldn’t find one to match and ended up with cranberry. Highly disappointed it’s not in the same color but a 2 quart is most used at my house.
"This set was a Christmas set from my husband. And I absolutely love these pans, and will continue to buy Rachel Ray Cookware. They are all light weight, heat evenly, and have done a great job with cooking anything that I have made. They are extremely easy to clean after use, it says they are dishwasher safe, but I don't ever put pots or pans in the dishwasher, so I wouldn't know. The bendable spatula that comes with the set has become my new favorite spatula in the kitchen. I would highly recommend these products."
I love how easy these clean. They take a while to heat up but 👋👋👋 that means they are durable!!!. The gas stove on porcelain is just amazing 👏. To those idiots burning their pots and pans. Go get a refund. It's a lifetime warranty!!! I totally recommend this set to beginner / intermediate cooks. Professionally you may bicker over the size of things but otherwise Rachel did a nice job patenting this cookware! 👏
I had previously owned the older set and they lasted 4 years! Honestly they are still being used but have sever wear and tear and the non-stick isn't nonstick anymore. This set after a few weeks of use ...seems to hold up although the grip is made out of a different rubber and the handle seems slimmer they work nicely non-stick of it works great and they seem durable
"I absolutely love these!! the middle-sized pot is taller than I was used to, but the design is such that nothing ever boils over. it's genius. the large pan is perfect for pasta dishes. and the non-stick surface is so nice. the outer surface is easy to clean. even the cook marks on the underside clean off easily with a magic eraser."
Several months I have had them no and no color change no shattered lids or any issues of any sort like all rachel ray pots they aren't meant to go over medium heat or be washed in a dish washer if you stick to this they last forever! They also go in the oven up to 350 I believe.
"I purchased my blue set in May 2016, it is now May 2020 and I am looking for a new set. I cook most of my meals, so they definitely have had a lot of use! I can probably make due with my old set even longer, but the non-stick has been scratched a bit by my boyfriend.  This set is durable, easy to clean and very heat resistant. My only complaint is that the lids never did seem to sit with an even seal."
"These are so wonderful! I love cooking with them so much, I even bought a second set to give to my mother in law! I use a glass top stove, and I have no problems. Just make sure to read the information that comes with them first. You cannot leave them on the stove after you have turned the stove off, or it could fuse to the glass top stove. I read the instructions and have had no problems whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and buy these! They are amazing. The bad reviews are from people who didn’t read the product information and are trying to place blame on others rather than taking responsibility for their own mistakes"
"Recieved the package with the original box I was scared for the glass lid, but when I openned it, it is in perfect condition. No dents or scratches. The sizes fits perfect to our glasstop stove, which has been a problem with the previous pots and pans that we have, either its too small or too big for the stove. Also, the color is nice, I initially eyeing the blue one but the purple one came which I think is more unique for kitchen wares. I will use this for the next day and will edit post if necessary, but so far it's a great buy"
"I use to use the Paula Dean pans, when the Rachel Ray set went on sale I bought them because my older Paula Dean set was old & showing grimy spots I couldn't wash off, the handles are extremely comfortable, they look amazing, cooking with them is great the heat is even though the pots & pans, next purchase will be the matching cookie sheets"
"I was a little worried after seeing some of the negative reviews about these, but my pots and pans came in with no problems! Used them to cook last night and no issues whatsoever. Beautiful color, no burning or melting my cooktop, lids fit perfectly... this set is just what I was needing and again, the color is amazing!!! I recently purchased a new home and was needing EVERYTHING, so to me this was a perfect starting out cook set. Love them and definitely recommend."
"What I love most about this product was the price! I bought it for my daughter & she was extremely happy with it. Loves the color & she loves to cook in it. She hasn't had any complaints what so ever, so I know if there was a problem she would let me know. I just might order it for myself. If youre looking to buy a great product to cook in well this is it! The money spent is well worth it. Go out & buy it for a friend, family member or even as a wedding gift! You won't regret the purchase & your friend or family member will love you(even more) for it!"
I absolutely love love love this set. my husband bought these for mothers day for me in may of 2020. i put mine in the dishwasher EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE MINE and my dishwasher has melted plenty of spoons lol. but these pans have help up non stick perfect since day 1. nothing has changed. i would buy these all over again.
The quality it’s amazing!!! They heat up so fast so you save a lot of time and energy. They are so high quality I’m blown away. I trust Rachel Ray for my pets food and I decided to give her a chance with this set and it’s so great I couldn’t be happier. I super recommend it. Please read the Manual on how to take care of them it’s important
"Bought this set in 2016, in 2018 everything is still perfect! The no stick is still in tact, the handles do not wobble. One of the best sets I’ve used."
"I absolutely love this set, wish color would have been lil darker but thats a personal decor choice BUT, I bought another set from another brand and hated the end result of my cooked item, I gave that set to my neice, she don't know any better yet, LOL I have at main house a stainless steel Wolfgang Puck set that I love and here I didn't want to invest the same money for temporary usage while here. I am soo very pleased!! Highly recommend"
"I can’t say enough about this set! I love the color, the weight and the non stick surfaces! The pots and pans are so pretty I sort of giggle when I take them out to cook. The also have covered handles so no more burning myself due to forgetting handle cover! Just Yay!!"
I like my Rachael Ray pots and pans. However after about four years they do start to fall apart a little bit. Mostly the Teflon coating. However they're pretty durable and they are dishwasher safe although I normally wash my pots and pans by hand and put dishes and utensils in the dishwasher. And my girlfriend loves the color! Very stylish!
I love this cookware set. I bought it to replace my 20 yr old set. They are deep and nothing sticks to them. Clean up is a breeze. The silicone handles stay cool with no parts to break off or come loose .They are also very well made with rivets that won't come loose. I use them everyday for breakfast to dinner prep. LOVE LOVE LOVE
"I am loving my new cook set! I have an awful electric stove, so cooking evenly isn’t easy. This set makes it a breeze! They’re beautiful, functional, SUPER EASY to clean (food slides right off!) and I love the rubber handles. I love Rachel Ray, so I was nervous about these as I don’t want to leave a bad review, but no need to be worried! Buy these! The colors are beautiful, and as long as you treat them right, they should last for years!"
"I dont know why I waited so long to get new pans. Very easy to clean. Dont need to use pam spray or butter to grease the pan. I always hated making scrambled eggs due to the clean up in the pan. But with these pans after the eggs go on the plate, one swipe with a wet rag and its practically clean, little to no scrubbing at all. I've seen this set got for over $200 and that seems to mush but $80 -$100 is well worth it. Plus you can choose a color you like."
These parts are extremely durable. I love how nice they look. I also love the size of the parts and how they don’t scratch and how easy they are to clean. It’s a great power and then I need a pass again I will definitely be buying more Rachael Ray pots and kitchen tools.
"love this set!! the pots are beautiful to make tea, or rice in. they are a breeze to clean as the nonstick is definitely nonstick! they’re heavy as in durable but not an annoying heavy. love cooking with them, highly recommend purchasing them. the little spatula is definitely a plus as well, perfect for making eggs with."
"Love these pots. Look nice, clean easy, the set comes in all the right sizes and it cooks great. I make big dinners every single night at home and have used these for over 4 years now."
"Good set of pots for our airbnb rental. People are really hard on rental cookware! Cleans with no abrasives and looks good. Handles are solid, in the past thats usually where cookware fails. Pain in the butt to keep tightening handles. This set has riveted fasteners which are very solid"
"I haven’t had these for long, but I love them! This was a very adult purchase for me as I’ve never had a matching set of pots and pans. I’ve always had oddball pots and pans."
I do alot of cooking. I do hope that they hold up over time but so far looks good. Food slides right out. Silicon grips are awesome. The way these were made is impressive as they have the handles and silicone grips tightly attached with no space for food to get stuck in. Silicone washers in glass top handles. Good sized and not heavy
"Husband loves to cook all the time. He loves using these pans! He’s made beef, chicken, eggs, pasta, and soups in them with no issues on a gas stove. Handles hold up to the heat well so he doesn’t have to use hot pads to remove them from burners. Would definitely buy again."
"Have had lots of non-stick pans, and they all either stick or scratch right away, this one is different. First it is not cheap light weight. It is solid and has a good feel and the balance is great so it does not want to tip over like many we have tried. It has a textured bottom but works perfectly on our induction cook top. Because of its thickness it takes a little longer to heat up than cheaper pans, but it also cooks more evenly and has a larger surface area before the slope of the sides starts."
"Best cookware I've EVER used. Easy to cook in, easy to clean up, nothing sticks from cheeses to potatoes cooked w/o oil to every other thing I've cooked so far. WHERE has this Sensarte Cookware been all my life!  Highly recommend these, got all 4 pcs Amazon has which is all I need to cook anything I want to cook. The lid from 4.5 qt stockpot fits on this 9.5"" fry pan."
"I'm very happy with the pan. Good quality, solid, excellent non-stick cooking surface. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that this is the second Sensarte that I've purchase with a loose handle. In both cases the mounting screw was too long. I had to cut about 2-3 mm off the screw in order to tighten the handle securely. In addition, there were a lot of loose aluminum shavings under the handle, which should have been cleaned prior to assembly. Hopefully the company will read this and improve the assembly quality control. But this is a minor complaint. I'd definitely recommend this pan."
"I am now on my 3rd Sensarte product. I've had expensive name brands, infomercial brands, but NOTHING has performed to the level this brand has. At first I thought maybe it was just the 1st product I bought from them, but then I bought the griddle, and it too worked like nothing else I've cooked with. So now I bought this frying pan and it too is just as reliable, just as easy, I just can't even believe there is cookware this great for such a reasonable price! I love these so much I am buying them as gifts!  My only complaint is with the lid on the really big/deep pan, it dropped (on the floor) and shattered, whereas none of my other pans have had that happen. But I have a lid from a previous pan that fits just fine. Sensarte, either use a different material, build it better, or offer replacement lids please!"
"I cook eggs with this every morning. After buying it 6 months ago, I decided to write a review and let others know how satisfied I am with it. With the right heat eggs leave zero residue. I barely have to clean it after cooking. I use it on an induction stove and have scrambled eggs in about 75 seconds after cracking the egg and 90 seconds after turning on the stove. Does exactly what I’d hoped it would do."
"I love this skillet! Just a little dollop of oil before you start cooking leaves it non-stick. It is just the right size between my 10” and 12” skillets. The weight is good, heavier than aluminum and lighter than cast iron. Great buy from Amazon !!"
Received today my frying pan and made some breakfast with it!!! It is non stick and looks very durable!!! Also their customer service is amazing!! Definitely recommend!!!
"I liked the fact that this pan has an even ,non stick heat. Easy to clean after cooking. I cook pancakes ,toasted sandwiches omelets And all come out evenly cooked and easy to flip without breaking up. I would highly recommend this pan"
"Finally, a pan claiming to be stick proof is actually stick proof. Eggs slide out of pan with only a couple drops of oil to season the bottom. Very happy."
"So far the pan has been great. Heats evenly, cleans easily. Looks great, especially the wooden handle. Not for putting in the oven or dishwasher. Cleans easily by hand which others recommend and I am following that advice. Hopefully, this pan will last a few years."
"I have nothing bad to say about this pan. It’s perfect for eggs in the morning, nothing sticks and it’s super easy to clean! Cant beat the price either"
"This is the best frying pan I have ever had. It is sturdy like cast iron but non-stick as a bonus. I can sear meat, cook an egg, or saute' with no issues what so ever. I will be getting another one in the future."
"Love it so easy to clean. No matter what you cook, all you need to do is wipe with paper towel. Be sure to read instructions before you use."
I had been looking for a small skillet. It is cast iron so you have to clean it as with other cast iron. It fries evenly. I like this skillet.
Got this for making eggs and it is superb. Sister liked it so much she got one too
"I bought this to cook eggs on. It works perfectly! Also, for some reason, I noticed some other reviews saying something about using this in the oven... Really, why would you use this in the oven?.. baffling, anyways. This is a great STOVE top product. 11/10 would recommend!"
"It has a non stick coating. Great for any egg styles, I use it for most of my cooking."
No se pegan los alimentos y yo lo uso siempre
I am extremely happy with this pan. I’m going to buy the other pieces as well. I purchased one before committing to more and was looking forward a good nonstick pan that didn’t contain perfluoro alcolyl substances.
This pan is well designed and manufactured. I use it for a couple of months and it serves me very well.
"These pans are fantastic. They are easy to clean, non stick, and I really like the heft of the pan. Not flimsy like most teflon pans. Definitely going to purchase more."
I love this pan. Eggs just slide right on to the plate. Easy to wipe clean. I would definitely recommend.
"This skillet cooks things with very little oil. It wipes clean easily. Washes with warm soapy water. So far, I've had no issues. I've purchased different sizes and happy with them ALL."
I’m really happy w my purchase
Very nice and very non stick.
I’ve been using this pan for 6 months and really happy with it! Food doesn’t stick to it and cleaning it is a breeze.
Solid! Sides are higher so we can cook bacon without all the splatter. Great for omelettes. Great weight and good handle!
"I love this pan, I use it everyday. So easy to clean, nothing has stuck to it yet! Already bought more from this brand and will be slowly converting my whole collection."
As a Chef of 16yrs this is hands down on of the best quality pans I've purchased. I will buyer q bigger one also. It's just a perfect skillet for eggs 🥚!
Easy to clean No stick Perfect for eggs/omelettes.
I love it for sunny side eggs
"Good, easy to clean"
Great quality
Replacing all pans and pots with this brand. Very high quality and very durable.
"I use this daily for breakfast. Really easy to clean, heats evenly and not too heavy. Overall, nice pan"
So far is perfect. Love it.
One of the best pan I ever owned . Cleaning is a breeze and the nonstick awesome .
I can fry 4 eggs at a time. It’s a great size
This is a high quality skillet. Nice design. Easy to use and easy to clean.
"Bought as a gift for my boyfriend--it was a hit!! Fantastic product, easy to clean, he uses it every day!! I never review anything-I bought more than one from this company, and if you cook, this one is awesome!!"
"Easy to clean pan. Somewhat bulky but durable. Deep sides and thick walls. There’s no rivets at the solid wood handle so it’s super sleek. Strong and reliable, everyday use kind of pan. From sauces to cheeses, meats to fruits, nothing sticks."
"Perfect little skillet for making my morning omelet. I use two eggs plus toppings and it all fits perfectly. Very easy to clean. I don’t even wash it everyday. There’s no use since I’m going to be using it again the next morning. Just heat the skillet up a tad and wipe out with a paper towel and done! If you’re looking for a small skillet for a single meal, this skillet is for you!"
It cleans up well and has comfortable handle that is lightweight and does not get hot
excellent
Me encato puedo cocinar absolutamente todo y nada se quema ni se pega. Definitivamente la recomiendo
Actually one of my favorite pans now!
I love the sturdiness and ease of clean up.
This pan was exactly what I was looking for. I make eggs in it every morning and they don’t stick at all.
Everthing
My wife asked that I order the 14” after using it. We have tried many but none compare to this one.
"I didn't realize this was such a small pan (my mistake) so when it arrived I thought this would be a great frying pan....for Smurfs. It did come with a small dent in the metal on the handle, but it's purely cosmetic this is the only reason I'm giving it a 4. It does heat up quickly, and works fantastic for making omelets. I haven't tried cooking anything else in this pan yet. Clean up is quick and easy, and my omelet came out of the pan easily. If there are pans like this in a bigger size, I would definitely purchase them. The interior of the pan looks a lot like cast iron and the bottom of the pan is gorgeous and functional."
Love it
very good non stick pam
Great value for your money
good value
"I bought this last July. I cooked on this almost every day from egg, crepes and sautéed veggies. I love using this frying pan but I am not sure why it’s doing this. First, it was just a bubble then it came off. Sadly, I have to throw it away. I also have the Sensarte pot and it’s also doing the same thing. It starts as a bubble then the nonstick layer chipped-off. I don’t use any abrasive in cleaning this pan. I don’t use any stainless steel utensils in my non-stick either. I bought the other kind of nonstick pan that they have. I will post review after using it for a few months."
"Always disappointed that will stick sooner or later scratches in the paint closing the no stick to peel this plan is engineered quite differently it is the pleasure of cast iron with a fused aluminum bottom it's handled bolts to the outside of the pan not bolted through , on the inside second this makes for a complete smooth pan all the way around and much easier to keep clean as far as the no stick is concerned I have high hopes that it too will prove a well engineered , time will tell"
"I LOVE this pan. Great for eggs. Nice weight, and feel. Handle is great. Looks nice. The weight and material does mean it takes a bit to heat up, but it maintains temperature and cooks evenly. Truly non-stick, heavy duty, and easy to clean. We also have the larger skillet with lid that led us to purchase this one as well. This will last, and is worth every penny."
"I first purchased the 2 quart pot for my son as a Christmas gift. (Him being a bachelor, he doesn't really shop for household items.) I was impressed with the quality and heaviness of the pot while he was impressed with the easy clean up. Since he liked it so much I ended up buying the 1.5 quart, the 8 inch skillet and the 4.5 quart soup pot. They arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. This is a very handsome set for men who enjoy cooking because of the attractive wood-look handle. Love the glass lids as well."
"Loved it when I first started using the pan for my morning eggs and other food preparations that I enjoy making! I received the pan in July 2021 and it was very nice and easy to use until about a month ago. My induction cooktop started going on and off while using only this pan.I believe that's why I see the bottom of some newer pans look to be different now.Since the company specified it was induction compatible at the time of purchase, I would like a replacement with a newer version!!!"
"I was skeptical to purchase this because it was a little on the expensive side.. but after biting the bullet and spending the money I actually loved this pan and recommended it to several friends.. it was great for frying eggs and super easy to clean... but then the ""fabulous"" non stick coating started to bubble up and has now started peeling off so I can no longer use the pan for cooking anything. I am so disappointed! Keep in mind I only used silicone cookware and soap and water when cleaning since it didn't take much effort, food basically just rinsed off. So if you are ok with buying expensive things that won't last 6 months then go for it but I will not be recommending sensarte anymore. :("
I love this little skillet! I bought it specifically to make scrambled and sunny side up eggs. It does the job beautifully. With just a touch of oil eggs slide out of the pan. Clean up is a dream. Simply wipe with a paper towel or dish cloth. Be sure to use non-metal utensils and your skillet will be scratch free. Arrived looking as described. No dings or dents. 10 out of 10. Would recommend!
"This thing is fantastic. I've stopped in the middle of making breakfast to type up a review real quick. The high points are: (1) it heats evenly so you don't have to carefully arrange your food in some kind of ""safe zone"" (2) it doesn't have any little exposed bolts where the handle attaches that cause egg grime to accumulate and make you sad (3) it doesn't do that thing where you find out that there's a razor-thin coating of antistick material that just flakes off. A+, love this thing"
"This pan looks nothing like the larger 2 we ordered from you. The handle is different, the inside is solid black, not dark gray with white speckles, and even the bottom is different. I'm sure it will perform the same but if you're going to offer different sizes you should at least have them all match."
The bevel is a little steep so flipping is awkward. but all I do is make French omelets in it so it is absolutely PERFECT.
"This is great non-stick cookware. I had to use a little drop of oil for the first use, but after that, I haven't really needed to add it. This pan has cooked evenly so far and is super easy to clean. I highly recommend this product!"
"Easy to clean and definitely non-stick. We use this for crepes and they slide right out. We have the larger fry pan and skillet from Sensarte and have been careful to wash only by hand. They have shown no signs of losing the non-stick surface and work great, even for eggs! Follow the manufacturers instructions on cleaning and care. These pans are definitely worth paying a bit more for!"
I really like this pan although it’s not exactly “nonstick.” It’s very balanced weight distribution and solid state feel makes it a pleasure to cook with. A couple of drops of oil is plenty to get the nonstick performance.
I tried few nonstick before. They all started to get burn on the middle. This one i have been using for about 5 months and works great and easy to clean. Highly recommended and you wont regret.
"Cooking surface has a rough texture and is not what I expected, after cooking an egg it was impossible to flip over."
"A little flimsy when filled with casserole but still did the job, I just had to place a sheet pan under it to support the pan."
Strong
"I used the non-stick version for years, even after the coating was ruined (probably because I didn't care for it properly. Expensive mistake.). I loved the feel and even heat distribution of this pan, so I finally broke down and bought the uncoated version and I'm so glad I did. It's so easy to use and care for. I've never had to put it in the dishwasher. If something sticks to it I just put some water in the bottom of the pan to let it soak, then wipe it out with a paper towel. If need be it can be scrubbed lightly with a scouring pad. Who needs non-stick pans anyway?  UPDATE: Two years later and would give this skillet 6 stars if I could. I had a hard time finding a lid to fit and had to return a couple of 10-inch lids that were too big. Cook N Home 02573 Tempered Glass Lid, 9.5-inch/24cm, Clear fits perfectly and I also use for my 100-year-old cast iron skillet."
"I am very pleased with this skillet. It cooks evenly and browns well. and is the perfect size to cook for one or two. I love that the handle does not get hot for times I forget to grab a dishcloth before picking it up! I am careful to line it with a paper towel so that it isn't scratched by my other skillets in the cabinet. Do be sure to let this cool completely before washing it. I wash it by hand and am sure to get any grease marks off of the bottom and sides so I don't get brown stains on the skillet. I don't put it in the dishwasher because the heat will set the grease into ""forever"" stains."
"The description reads ""Made of professional quality 18/10 stainless steel"" however it is not stamped 18/10 anywhere. Quote from an email I received from the manufacturer: "" If the pans are not stamped 18/10 then they are not 18/10"". I reported this issue to Amazon quite a long time ago yet the false description remains."
"I needed a new skillet for our glass top stove. The old pan I was using no longer had a flat bottom. A little research determined that this type of skillet, with a layered copper-stainless steel base was the most recommended for glass top stoves. My wife was concerned that I chose a plain surface rather than non-stick. After using this for a couple of weeks, it appears that I made the right choice. The pan heats quickly and evenly, and you generally can use a lower heat setting than you normally would. It cooks nicely anywhere in the pan. That is what I was looking for. Sticking is not particularly a problem and cleaning has been easy. My wife doesn't like that it doesn't return to the brand new shiny finish after each washing, but it really isn't a problem. Time will tell if the bottom bows over time, but I bought Cuisinart because we have an old large fry pan from them that is still very flat after 20 years."
"Waited several months to write this to try the pan in all circumstances. And it worked great at frying, sauteing, you name it. Plus a very easy clean up. Once in a while i will use Bartenders Friend to restore shine. Did try it on steaks but was not quite as good as my cast iron pan that has ridges. Benefit of chicken breasts, veal etc is it leaves a nice fond that is easily deglazed with any type of cheap wine for a great pan sauce. As noted, no higher than medium to medium-high is best"
"So far so good. I have cooked scrambled eggs and grilled cheeses in this skillet. The heat distribution is excellent. My grilled cheeses and scrambled eggs turned out better in this pan than they did in it’s non-stick skillet predecessor. Please note that you may not not need as high a temperature cooking with this skillet as some others. I noticed medium/low cooks in the same amount of time as medium/high did in my previous skillet.  I am slowly replacing all of my non-stick cookware with Cuisinart pots and pans. This is the second one I have gotten and I have been well pleased with both of my purchases.  Update: 9-18-18 Unfortunately, my positive feelings toward this skillet did last long after I posted my initial review. I noticed a small pit mark after it came out of the dishwasher soon after. It was the size of two pencil heads. It was irritating but I decided to live with it. Then today, I noticed yet another bigger pitting mark. I am glad I am still (barely) within the 30 day limit and can return it. I have never had a stainless steel pan that this has happened to before. I am not sure if this pan is an anomaly or if the whole Chef series has a pitting issue. I may try the pro series but definitely will not order from this series again. I want to stress the pan was not even put to hard use."
"I burnt the smaller version of this pan so I bought this one, but the 10"" size. I am so pleased. It fits two large pork chops, it's perfect for pancakes. I put baking soda with water for a while, then clean it with one of those sponges that have a soft side and a stronger side. I have an electric stove and that is not a problem."
"After having been gifted two smaller size Cuisinart Chef's Classic pans and being very happy with them I decided to buy a larger one. I'm extremely happy with the way this pan cleans up, even if something sticks to it. We usually fry our meats in a pan using only water and allow the water to dry up so that we get a nice brown sear on the meat which of course makes it stick to the pan somewhat. However, cleanup is usually very easy using a light scrubby sponge. If there's any hard bits that are more stubborn to get off we just pour water into the pan, bring it to a boil and lightly scrape off the residue. We use these pans several times a week and I would definitely recommend them!"
"It became my favorite skillet in the kitchen now. It is the perfect size pan for my family of two to use. I always add the oil when the pan is evenly hot, then the food will not stick at the bottom and easy to be turned ( see attached photo) The skillet is still cooking for a while when the stove is turned off, so make sure well control the time to avoid overcooking."
"Love it so much, I bought two (one 8-inch and one 10-inch). One thing about the 8-inch skillet was that I, for some reason, thought it should have been a little larger than what it was but I still love it - so I bought the larger 10-inch skillet also. A ""win-win"" for me because I love them anyway. They are about what I expected from Cuisinart - the weight and quality were as I expected."
"Bought this pan to actually see if I could stand using a stainless steel pan. It was inexpensive and a good size. Ends up this is the pan I cook most with now. It's easy to clean. (I don't do eggs or dairy, just FYI) But this was a surprise how much I liked this pan. One draw back is you can't lift it to get the food out of it, you have to scoop it out due to the size. But great stainless pan overall."
"I am enjoying this skillet. Cast iron skillets have been my preference for decades, however they are not recommended for glass top stoves, so I bought this skillet. It beats evenly a d cleans easily. I think I have used it for about two weeks now and it has been used to make all sorts of foods from vegetable and meat dishes to grilled cheese sandwiches. It my preferred skillet on the stove top."
"I use this skillet on an almost daily basis and it works great. I'm no chef and tend to cook everything on High. A little olive oil and constant flipping to keep the food from sticking and it makes the skillet easy to clean. I'm very pleased with it, I love stainless steel and won't cook with coated non-stick skillets or pans."
"Unlike some reviews, I am extremely impressed with my 12"" and 10"" pans. I've made melty cheeseburgers, stir frys and scrambled eggs and cheese not to mention hash browns and potatoes o'brian. Both pans wipe clean easily. I just season the pan before each use. Wonderful!"
"This is a really good product, good value for the quality, have used several times and am very pleased. Did not want anymore non stick junk, and if you take care of this it will last!"
Love it!!!
"I am SO happy that I bought this pan! With its wonderful heat distribution, it cooks everything evenly and the food comes out perfect. It is extremely easy to clean, and, after using it & cleaning it many times, it continues to look as good as it did the day it arrived. I highly recommend it."
"Lovely skillet. Brushed interior. Stay cool handle. Good balance. Cleans up well. Wash it, use a little barkeepers friend. Eliminates dry spots. I'm very pleased with the way it handles."
"When I want a new cooking utensil I always shop Cuisinart first. That name is rimnent in my kitchen andi have relied on it for 50 years now.Some consider it pricey, but the quality it's well worth the price. These pans are also beautiful and will last more than a lifetime."
I have purchased three sizes of these Cuisinart frying pans and they are perfect to replace my former set by a different brand. They have worked better than my non-stick pans and I love the clear covers available. (An update: Have now used these pans in several sizes for a few months and they look as good as the day I first purchased them. They have a nice weight to them. Super easy cleanup and they do well in both oven (but check top temps in instructions) and in the dishwasher. Do not use when recipe specifically calls for non-stick but otherwise they work beautifully.)
This pan cooks great and cleans up beautifully. It's the perfect size for a couple of chicken tenders. I love this pan. I would buy again.
"Works nicely on induction burner, but I was surprised to see the care instructions said no lemon scented dishwasher detergent, unlike any other stainless steel I've owned."
I was looking for a pan without a nom stick coating as not all foods need to be cooked in a non stock pan. I really like this pan and it heats up evenly and is the right size for me
"It looks great, feels g, awesome craftsmanship. Really well made and size is great for something in between smaller and larger pan. Overall I’m very satisfied with quality and price. Good buy for sure."
"We have had one of these 10 inch skillets for a couple of years. We use it all the time for stovetop cooking, most frequently for frying a couple of hamburgers or for heating tortillas. These skillets are very high quality - they heat evenly, clean up easily, look great, and the handles stay cool for stovetop cooking.  Now that the kids are older, we have been using the 10 inch skillet for cooking so much that we needed a second one. So I ordered the same one again, and it is just like the first one, perfect for our stovetop cooking. Perfect for everyday use, easy 5 stars - an everyday MVP."
It was just what I was looking for. I love stainless steel cookware and had gotten to many non stick pans that I didn't like.
"hope to take care of this one and make it last, i will follow care instructions and see if i cant keep it longer than the last one."
I bought the ten inch and eight inch. Love these pans. They get used every day and I am very impressed with them. I would give them as a gift and I highly recommend them. Great Amazon price too.
Excellent fry pan. Even heat easily controlled in food.
I find this pan the perfect size for 2 people's meals. It cooks evenly and isn't too heavy to use.
"The perfect size pan when cooking small meals. It is easy to clean and cooks evenly edge to edge. Best of all it is safe to use metal utensils, and of course it is dishwasher safe."
"I love these pans, very easy to use. Heat up with either oil, butter or the spray and it works great. Mostly used for eggs, saute, quesadillas, etc. Very easy to clean, works great."
"Heavy duty pan, good size for 2 people"
The best I have used
"I am not a chef or a highly skilled home cook, but I enjoy cooking. This brand provides the right combination of quality and value for me. Remember not to use high heat, as per Cuisinart's instructions, because of the efficient conductivity of the metal. Eggs might still stick, but that is still an easy clean up. Tip: consider using grapeseed oil rather than olive oil. Not as flavored as olive oil and will heat higher with less flash risk."
"I love this pan. Better than worrying about all the non-stick chemical garbage leeching into your food. We are looking to replace all of our cookware with this line. Cleans well, just needs a little soak sometimes, but does come clean easily."
"I did know if I was going to like it, but once I used it and thought how is this pan going to clean up. Well, I was amazed by how well it cleaned up. You don't use harsh pad to clean it, otherwise you will damage the protective coating. I just ordered the 8"" size to go with my 10"" and 12"" pans. Thanks for having this product available!!"
Saw reviews about people burning food... I read instructions and followed and no burning.. cleans up easily.. fantastic pan!
"its worked great so far. its not a several 100 nice one but i can't tell the difference. my food is cook? i got it for the purpose of searing chicken on one side then flipping it and throwing it into the oven since the handle doesn't have rubber on it and the chicken has turned out so good that way. the only helpful tip i can say is you should pick up a thing of bar keepers friend, it well save u so much time when u go to clean it."
Great and worth the price
"Love these pans. This is a replacement for the same skillet that I left on the stove for over an hour with the stove on! The food was destroyed, house was filled with smoke and the smoke detectors were going off but the house didn't burn down. The pan was not totally wrecked but the pan didn't look the same after that so I wanted to replace it. So user error is the only problem I have had!!!"
"This is a beautiful fry pan. Great quality, easy to clean and makes me feel like a professional cook. I prefer this over a nonstick so I can ensure browning and flavor on my food."
"This is my second Cuisinart Open skillet pan I've purchased through Amazon. I loved the first one, so I ordered another smaller one. Excellent quality and easy to clean! I see a third purchase in the near future!"
"Love all the Cuisinart pots and skillets. I don't care for pots with teflon or ceramic coatings. They all change color and stain, whereas stainless steel cleans immediately and is always reliable. I also appreciate that the covers from other Cuisinart pots fit the skillet perfectly."
"Ordered a sauce pan and two fry pans which I use nearly every day and more than a year later they still look brand new. These pans are heavy/weighty/substantial, very well made. They heat evenly and clean up so easily - does not absorb what you're cooking so there are no food stains left behind - I really wish I could afford a whole set of this stuff, I love Cuisinart!"
"I purchased one of these a few years ago. Loved it so much that I recently decided to throw away all my ""non stick"" and replace them with these."
Beautiful pans! Plan to purchase one more for a set. Cleans nice in dishwasher. Cooks even. l have four of the brand. Very nice! Best pans I have ever owned
"I have the 10 inch and 12 inch Skillets, they are by far the best I have used in the past 45 years of cooking, I love the fact that they go from stove top to Oven and Table if I choose to do so. Perfect sizes and the helper handle on the 12 inch skillet is definitely a plus, I have several other skillets that do not have the even heat distributions, that both of this skillets have. love them, love them."
For years I've been pretending that I could use a frying pan as a saute pan. I was wrong. This pan has opened my eyes to a whole new world of cooking!! It's extremely well-made and easy to use. It's fast becoming one of my favorites!
"This pan is of a good quality and as I have worked as a restaurant cook for many years this pan is of that caliber, easy to clean and vitually doesn't stick, I like it alot"
"I do a lot of cooking and have found that the nonstick products do NOT work for me. I started purchasing stainless a bit ago and this is my latest. I carries an even heat and goes from range top to oven in a heartbeat. Cleans up beautifully and I can honestly say it stands up to the ""clad"" stainless for 1/3 the price. Great buy-wonderfull product."
"Beautiful, light weight, easy to clean with no excess grooves."
"This was the first skillet I bought when I got my own place and it has served me extremely well. I've thrown countless foods at it, tossed it in the dishwasher, the oven, and places that frankly, I'm not willing to discuss in a public forum. It's held up extremely well and deserves all five of the stars I've given it."
I like the sturdiness of the pen and the easy clean.
"I usually cook eggs in my well-seasoned cast iron skillet, but my husband's blood iron level is a little higher than normal, so I got this to replace the cast iron pan. It does fine with eggs, as long you pre-heat it on medium and don't cook above med-high. Nice heft, high quality construction, easy to clean."
"I absolutely love this pan to death! Even though it isn't nonstick it's just as easy to clean if I soak it for 5 mins. That's a totally different experience from other steel pans I've had in the past. Highly recommend it! Very good quality and it does it's job, plus no worries about eating nasty Teflon...gross"
It is good but it’s not non stick . Use a steel wool to clean up mess . Don’t keep in dishwasher . I am hoping this will last long if well taken care of .
Working fine
"Pretty great pan! It is not completely non-stick, though. Food seems to stick to it quit a bit, but perhaps it’s something on doing wrong on my end."
"Great little browning pan, plan on buying larger pan."
"Very sturdy and nice pan. Used for glass smooth top range and does well, no sliding etc"
Glad I ordered this. It works great on my induction cooker.
My new favorite frying pan. Easy to clean and I’ve purchased two more so I can cook multiple things at the same time.
We just got it today! But I am sure we will love it!
Headlines hilarious right?😁 Anyway. It's stainless steel. I literally feel like it will outlive me with no maintenance at all. Old pan was non stick. After a year it was unusable. Apparently washing it also damaged it? Whaaaaaaat?
"Easy to clean, just the right size."
It is a really nice fry pan.
"This is a very high quality fry pan. My silly boyfriend burned the crap out of something and it cleaned up and looks like new. Barkeepers Friend to clean it. Coconut oil to fry or Sautee. I'm done with ""non-stick"" Teflon and all that plastic!"
I love this product for all the important reasons. It is beautiful. It is a good heavy stainless steel. It cleans well. It cooks food wonderfully. I am always happy with the outcome. I will only buy Cuisinart pots and pans. I keep it out where it can be seen because it looks so good!
My son loves this frying pan that I sent as a gift.
"I was worried about Teflon in my own pot so, I looked to upgrade. I searched around and decided on this one. Note: You must treat the pot with cooking spray before first use. No biggy. Just thought I'd mention that.  I love the hole in the lid. It prevents the dreaded overflow that happens with standard pot/pans. As you can see, it was just used. The The pour triangle, on two, opposite sides of the pot, make pouring out liquid so easy. No more burnt fingers or food going accidentally down the drain. The only thing that happened in my usage (about 10 times thus far), is that I let the water evaporate and had burnt food a few times. The marks came off with little effort.  I made a good choice with this purchase."
"This panis the best one I think I e ever owed! It's perfect. I just wish I had decirvered more like this one yrs ago before aLl the ""wrong non stick"" ones! It's just perfect for a omelet or whatever you want to cook in it! So easy to clean! I hate to admit it but I like it even better then my cast iron skillets🤷🏼"
"For the price this pan can't be beat. Sturdy, heavy duty almost like have cast iron without the weight. For best non-stick performance make sure you pre-heat the pan adequately before adding food. It even came with a free wooden spatula/stir tool."
"This is a very affordable pan. We use ours for heating up sausages, primarily. I'm not sure I would call it non-stick. It does not have that ""non-stick"" coating, in fact the pan itself is extremely textured. That said, it is easy to clean."
I thought I was in big trouble when I burned some milk in this pan but it wiped off very easily. Some reviews complained about the lid not being a tight seal but I tend to leave my lids unsealed anyway when I'm simmering. So far so good with this pot.
Great finish. Been using for 2 months but feel it will last.
I have 2 of them and they get used every morning for breakfast meal. I hand wash and dry mine after use each day. They look good as new. I coated my wooden spatula with tung oil and it is holding up nicely.
"Love this pan! So easy to clean. Great for meats, omelette, etc."
Will be purchasing a larger one. Love this pan.
Happy wife-Happy Life
Heated up slower than expected ..BUT... preformed exceptional..
Love the look and easy clean up
Love this pan
It's a really nice little sauce pot. The handles aren't actually wood but it's still very sturdy. Use it all the time.
My wife loves it and asked me to buy her another one lol
It’s was very nice and big!!!!
Very happy with this purchase. Easy to clean. Sturdy. The nonstick coating is superior to anything I have used before.
The stay cool handle and vented lid are wonderful. The pot is easy to maintain and a joy to use.
"Overall this is a good set, but I did not like the little spout opening at the top because it dries out the food if you’ve cooked ahead of time. The opening ofcourse causes food to get dry as air escapes even if the lid is shut"
I Love these pans... and they were delivered really fast...
I love this cookware set! I even ordered a set for my daughter and she loves it also! Nothing burns or sticks to the pans and they are so easy to clean!
"Non-stick works well, very esy to clean, attractive handle. Hope it lasts!"
It is just as pretty as it looks on here. I really love it!
Happy wife-Happy life.
"The pans distribute heat evenly, and they are easy to clean. It has been a pleasure cooking again with good quality cookware. I wish the skillets had lids for simmering or steam."
Lovely pot. Well made. Very easy to clean!
"Buenísimo, súper de calidad"
"There are great,. I just love them."
This is an excellent value and works great and cleans even easier! Highly recommended!
Nice pan.just to heavy and to deep for what I was looking for
It cooks like a champ and cleans up better than any pan I've ever owned.
"nice size pan good for many small meals , fried egg, scrambled hamburger saute onions peppers etc."
Food cooks evenly
Not good for rice
"The assortment of sizes in this set allows for a variety of cooking options, which is greatly appreciated at this price point. The pans' nonstick surfaces and ability to evenly heat food makes cooking and cleanup incredibly easy. The faux granite base and wooden look handles give the pots a muted, clean look while allowing enough texture to keep their look interesting and attractive. The curved handles are ergonomic. I feel the logo on the lid could have been better situated, but other than that the sets' appearance is pretty much perfect. Very pleased."
"I haven't had one single thing stick and stay stuck to these. I'm a bit of an absent minded multitasker so it's very forgiving for those of us who are making macaroni and cheese but there's that stuff in the dryer that needs out and the washer stuff needs in the dryer, what's that buzzing? Stupid stinkbug back in the house and the cat's about to smell bad so go get him oh man I gotta clean the litter box cause the cat blew it up what's that other smell though oooooooh snap I needed to take the garbage out, etc...  Come back, stuff is still not burned and if it got a bit sticky on the bottom, it comes off with little effort. Good heat distribution so no hotspot problems. My only complaint is MORE LIDS, but really I'm happy with these. I'd definitely get more and absolutely recommend them."
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of HOOEMD 3pcs Nonstick Cookware Set. I've been using this for over 5 months with positive results. I've fried and sauteed many things and this seems to clean up very well. I like that HOOEMD yses Non-toxic materials and 100% free of PFOS, PFOA. After cooking, I let the pans soak and use the typical rough sponge to get that as new cleaning, HOOEMD seems to be very abrasion resistance and the pans have a quality hardened scratch-resistant coating on it. I do get lazy to really get those stains off the bottom of the pan but for now they are fine. I love the handle on these pans too, very comfortable to hold while cooking. Again I'm still in love with these pans for now."
"I Love this Cookware. It looks nice, and is sturdy. It heats evenly, and works well on electric and induction Cooktop. It is super easy to clean.  I thought that we had ruined the pan; but the burned mess, slid off the pan. The first night, I turned on the wrong burner, instead of turning another one off. The sauce REALLY cooked down. I was sad until I picked the pan up, and the burned on mess, slid off. I did not even get it to the sink… did not have to scrub.. I LOVE this cookware."
"Honest review here.  Great value at $45.00 for 3 set. Easy to clean... LOVE THEM!  PROS 100 percent free of PFOS, PFOA.  Non-toxic materials.  Scratch resistant which I love (the hubby is very rough on pans...so I love that these are so solid and durable).  Easy to clean!  Even heat distribution.  CONS NONE! BUY THEM!"

"This set offers a nice selection of sizes for everyday use for a single person. The design is really attractive: The faux granite and wooden handles provide a light, understated look. The pot and pans work well: Heat distribution is even, the non-stick works and cleanup is easy. This is my set for everyday use - I like it a lot."
"These non stick pans have been great so far. The non toxic non stick coating seems durable so far. I love the soft wooden handles. These don’t go in the dishwasher, but clean up has been really easy with the granite coating. I have high hopes these pans will last for a long time."
"I am enjoying using this HOOEMD cookware. The nonstick has been reliable and, the extra bonus, is that they look great, too! I have gotten compliments from guests when they have seen them - I think that I might actually display them in my kitchen."
Heat distribution; Easy to clean.
Great product! But lid not same size as pot!
"Beautiful, practical, lightweight, easy to use and clean! I took a chance and purchased this set blindly, as it had, at the time of my purchase, zero reviews. I am glad I took a risk! There are things on Amazon that have stellar reviews but are pure garbage! This set deserves much more attention than it receives! My only complaints, which aren't really ""complaints,"" are as follows:  1) the wooden spatula that's included with this set is really useless and pointless---I used it once, washed it and, after it dried thoroughly, I tossed it into the trash because it dried ""moldy-looking""; 2) I highly recommend the manufacturer consider an additional lid or two with this set, for one or both of the frying pans; 3) unless I am unaware of it's existence, a more complete set of additional, matching cookware OR individually sold, matching cookware would make my heart and kitchen complete!"
"I love this pan. Truly nonstick and easy to clean. It shows a Lid, but mine did not come with a lid."
Non stick as advertised. Worked great for eggs and cheese. Time will tell for the scratch resistance.
"Easy to clean, heats evenly and looks very nice."

"Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of this pan because it was bought for my fiance who is stationed in another state. However, according to him this is one of the best pans he has owned! It's the perfect size, easy to clean, and heats up nicely. It also has a built in strainer for pasta. Overall, I recommend!"
"I could not find a 2 quart pot, had seen this one on Amazon. It cooks great, looks great and I need more of these pieces. Try one of this cookware and I fell you will enjoy it a lot."
Got these this week. I cooked 3 eggs yesterday. Didn't notice anything odd. Cooked some ground beef today and now we have this. Pretty disappointing. I'd give this brand a miss if you can.
"I've been using the T-Fal brand set of 3 sizes pans for a couple of years and like them, but it doesn't even compare to Utopia's set!! The bottom of Utopia's set is made with a much heaver aluminum, the handles are much more convenient and the nonstick is much smoother!! Cooks great and very easy to clean."
"These are the best non-stick pans I've ever had! I have never had a frying pan cook foods like these. Hamburger, chicken cook up tastier for some reason. The largest one is the most useful for me and I would probably pay the cost of the three for the one alone. I wish Amazon would carry more of these and at least one even bigger. I highly recommend these."
"It was a most pleasant surprise when I first used these pans. I was used to something of lesser quality and the first time I tried the small and medium sized ones (haven't used the larger one yet but I'm sure my thoughts will be the same), I was amazed. Nothing stuck, pans heated evenly, and are a breeze to clean. I wish I had gotten these before wasting my time and money on other inferior pans."
Heavy gauge aluminum beats the pants off my copper color Copper Chef fry pan that cost more than this set of 3 pans. Non-stick surface is the best I've seen. And all the sizes we need priced less than one of the other fry pans I've seen.  Best value for the price for me in a long time.
"You can buy heavier pans, and probably also pans whose nonstick coating is somewhat more durable. But these skillets work well and are an excellent buy. Food slides off of them even when I use minimal oil. And cleanup is a breeze.  I've owned iron pans, enameled iron pans, tri-ply pans, and a carbon steel pan. These all have their uses but nonstick pans are my most often used skillets.  My last Utopia nonstick skillet was good for a bit more than a year of daily use, and it was the subject of some abuse (by other people). I expect that these will be good for closer to two years, which is all you can expect from nonstick skillets used on a daily basis.  If it's of interest to readers, these seem to be lighter than my previous Utopia skillet."
"These are great pans. the sizes work well for me. My issue was that they didn't all work on my kitchenaid induction stove top. I can only use stainless steel, steel and iron on my induction top, the bottoms have to have enough metal to activate my stovetop and if they don't my top will not work. Amazon is great with their return policy and will send me a new set and I returned the dysfunctional set. Hopefully the new set will work."
I had 1 really good induction frypan very much like these and searched to get more sizes of the same brand but no luck. I found this similar looking inexpensive set and gave them a try with some doubt they would be very good. I am amazed that they are every bit as nice and almost identical to the one I already had and liked so much. I am very pleased with my purchase and Amazon got them here in like 2 days...amazing. Flat and smooth for our glass top stove and work great on our countertop induction unit. High quality feel. Update. The 8 inch fry pan came with a nick on the edge. Amazon customer service is excellent and the issue was taken care of to my satisfaction.
"Arrived a few days ago. I almost didn't orderthrm because of the few bad reviews. I love them! 1. Three sizes, all slightly smaller than advertised. 2. Bottoms are perfectly flat. 3. Good weight, don't feel cheap. 4. Slick nonstick coating, I washed and cooked fried eggs in a little butter. Slid right out. 5. I use these only on my portable induction stove top which can get super hot. I plan to use moderate heat because that's how I cook unless I'm boiling water. I like these pans a lot, they work well and I want to protect the finish. 6. I also only hand wash my cookware. Easy to clean.  If they disappoint me later, I'll change this review."
"Well made and when they say non-stick, they mean non-stick! Not too heavy, not too light, and best of all, real live Bakelite handles. No need to grab a towel or pot holder just to take them off the range. I don't understand this need for all metal handles. Just so you can put them in the wall oven? I have other cookware designed for that.  Can't be beat, especially at this price-point. A real bargain!"
"Gran producto de muy bien tamaño y además de buen precio, son muy resistente y de muy buen material, muy buenos y recomendable."
"I've recently purchased both this frying pan set and the pot set from Utopia, and I'm very happy with both. Both cooking and cleaning have been completely non-problematical. Rice, eggs, meat, cheese---I've cooked all of these things with the Utopia sets, and nothing sticks, despite not using any non-stick spray at all. I've also put these straight into the dishwasher, and they've come out unscathed. A great price, and I'm glad I bought them."
"These pans are quite ""nice for the price"" cookware; they replace some cheap Mirro pans I had for many years. These new pans have a nice solid feel to them, but they are not super heavy. I've already cooked in them a few times, and their heat distribution is nice and even. I always use either nylon or silicone utensils with my nonstick cookware, and I see no scratches at all so far. If you take care of your non-stick cookware (I wash them by hand), these should last for quite a while, and I recommend them as a great deal!"
"I’m really impressed with these pans. I was a little nervous because the price was so good, but once they arrived I was very pleasantly surprised. They’re super sturdy and thick. They cook food evenly and are easy to clean. I love how they look and the 3 sizes this set comes with are perfect. Anything you need to cook, you’ll be able to with these. If you’re looking for some new pans but don’t want to break the bank, I highly recommend these. I’m super happy with my purchase and will be buying some pots from this brand next!"
I bought these a year ago and they are still in perfect condition after one year. I've had much more expensive pans that didn't hold up nearly as well. I definitely recommend these. My only complaint is that they are almost too slippery which sometimes makes it hard to get the spatula under things to flip them but I don't really consider that a valid complaint for non-stick pans.
"so...I moved into a place with an induction stovetop and needed to buy pans that worked with induction stovetops. found these and was very surprised that they are very heavy and have a nice, solid feel to them. the pan edges curve in a little at the top and it seems to keep the food inside the pan when stirring. the handles are solid and do not get hot. I am happy with this purchase!"
"Love love love these skillets. They made Thanksgiving day so much easier. Sit flat, heat evenly, super easy to clean and heavy duty and sturdy. I was disappointed no lids came with these but I have old lids that fit perfect. Great bargain. Fast delivery great price."
"I received the Utopia Kitchen Nonstick Frying Pan set. I was impressed with the shipping protection to protect the shipment. I have used the pans and they work as advertised. The handles are very comfortable and stay cool My eggs at breakfast slid out of the pan without any sticking or food residue. The pans heat uniformly and quickly. The three sizes should cover most all of my fry pan cooking needs. The only question, which is too early to tell, is the longevity for how well the coatings hols up over time. I felt for the price the pans were definitely a good deal and I am glad I bought them."
"easy to clean, nothing sticks, they are very sturdy, absolute best nonstick pan i have ever used in my entire life 10/10 would reccomend. i mostly use cast iron but i eat a lot of eggs and you just need a non stick pan for those, these are absolutely perfect for frying eggs and so easy to clean."
"Nice non stick surface right off the bat. If it fails to last a year, I'll make note here.  Nice for the price.  Smallest pans weight balance is off and tips to the handle side. That's my only complaint.  The bolts inside the pan are also coated, making it not stick to them & easy to clean."
"Ordered this exact set back in 2014. They lasted me this long! I was only replacing because the original set, you had to attach the handles and they were not holding on any more. I knew they were great pans so I didnt care about the handles and knew they lasted this long. I was so surprised when I opened the box. The handles are riveted on! The pan is 100x better than before! I'm so happy! It's a little thicker, more sturdier, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING STICKS! BEST SET OF PANS EVER!"
These pans are amazing. Easy to clean. Food won’t stick and very affordable. I had received the TASTY pan set for Christmas and they didn’t last me but maybe a month before they started chipping and got burned on the bottom from the stove. These on the other hand are very durable and I will continue to purchase these for ever
"I bought this set a year+ ago. Hubby does most of the cooking and they have held up just fine. Easy to clean. Just a tip, if you are going to 'stack' them in your cupboard, keep the foam pads that they are wrapped in when you receive them. This will keep the surface of the pans from scratching."
I was surprised on how well these pans turned out to be. I thought for the price they would have been somewhat flimsy as the price was rather low for 3 pans. They are actually well constructed and sturdy. They are deeper than the ones I replaced but I like that. No issues with cooking or cleaning. I recommend these and would buy them again.
"Awesome pans! Great quality and great value. Food cooks evenly and doesn’t stick. Perfect for my induction cooktop. My first order the 11” pan had a 1” area where the finish was missing, but the company replaced it with no hassle and very fast delivery. Their Customer Service is top notch. I will be buying more from this company and highly recommend."
"You know sometimes when you spend your hard earned money and end up with junk, well this aint it. These are well made. They are heavy. Well worth the price. I was even impressed by the packaging. I'm thinking of buying another set and store them for the future incase they stop making them."
So far I've only been using the medium sized one and it works very well with my induction cooking unit. Today I did 4 pieces of chicken thighs at 320 degrees (1000 watts) and it did it very fast. In fact I had to twice adjust down the power settings as the thing was about to burn the meat!  I'm very pleased with these new induction style cookware and I'm gradually adding to the collections.
I rarely write reviews. This product has impressed me a lot especially for the cost. I've used it a couple dozen times. I've even burned steaks on it. I've been extremely impressed how well the non stick works. I hardly need to wash it with a sponge. Often just running hot water on it gets all residue off. This far exceeds my tfal pan. Strongly recommend.
First of all we've owned at least a dozen frying pans in the last 15 years. No matter the brand or coating they all were just lousy pans. We thought the electric cooktop was at fault. Then we got this set - to say we were surprised is an understatement - these pans are hands down the best we have ever had. Nothing sticks to them - they cook totally evenly and cleanup is a breeze. No more smashed yolks for us! In fact we love them so much we got set for all of our kids AND an extra set for us!
"After a lot of frustration, we finally found cookware for our new glass top stove that is made specifically for that. Sturdy and good looking with good handles that don't get hot and no screws to loosen and make the handles wobbly."
"Can't use metal utensils, but at the price, who can complain? Heavier gauge than the reasonably priced ones I buy separately in the stores.The only thing lacking is a separate lid set to purchase. In stock, so fast delivery."
"I still cannot believe how great these pans are! I have used them every day since my purchase and I am thrilled. No need to use oils or sprays to keep food from sticking...it doesn't. They clean so easily too, so much that I wish I had owned them a long time ago. They are nice and heavy and the handles are great which I have had issues with previously with other pans. Ran one through the dishwasher the other day and was very pleased. Highly recommend."
I've had these for months and the covering hasn't chipped or burned. I treat my pans pretty badly but these have held up. They are sturdy and cook evenly despite what are the reviews say. I don't know what they're talkin about. My food Cooks wonderfully every time.
"I was looking for some cheap frying pans and when I came across this set, I thought great! But to my surprise, I didn't expect such quality, I have cooked with these pans several different foods and they turned out great. They are easy to clean with a non-stick surface."
They take a little longer heating up but they are great for what ever I cooked in them and easy clean up.
"Muy contentos con la compra de estos sarténes que ofrecen una excelente calidad a pesar de su buen precio. El peso y material se sienten muy bien. El mango con remaches muy resistente, asegura que no se aflojar a con el tiempo. Tenemos casi un año con ellos y se encuentran en muy buen estado. El antiaderente no ha sufrido daños."
"These perform better than other expensive pots and pans I’ve had. Nothing sticks! The handles have good grip, and they are easy to clean and maintain. Would definitely recommend!"
Don't know what to say about these pans food slides right off easy to clean I would definitely buy again for the price
I have had these pans over a yr still great and still in great shape love cooking eggs and hamburgers in them prefect for chicken breasts and cooking fried potatoes
"Well coated , heavy bottomed and sturdy non stick pans. Just what I have needed for a long time. I was using ikea pans but the nonstick coating on them frequently got tarnished , even when we only hand wash our pans. These are really good quality for the price."
I accidentally let one pot boil dry. It did not do any damage. I am impressed. The food slides right out. They look like new after a month. I have thrown out other pans by now.
"I can’t speak to its durability. But I will speak to their customer service. I contacted Amazon, one of the pans bottom was slightly curved. The company sent me Their apologies and three new pans. The pans are easy to clean and have a good weight to them. Very happy so far."
"solid quality, awesome price. Very happy and they work great on my induction stove top"
We have had these for more than a year now and these pans are amazing. Good quality. Easy to clean. You won’t be disappointed
"Better than expected. They clean easily and so far have kept their original shine--but it's only been two weeks. Nice non-stick. Good for eggs, pancakes, burgers, stir-fries. Very happy."
Great Pans...love cooking with hem. Very pleased with this purchase and the seller.
Really nicely made and good thickness/weight. Have spent a lot more on name brand pans that did not perform nearly as well. After several years wore out 1st set and bought same brand again.
because of arthritis lifting heavy pot pan is not my greatest desire because I drop it. These fit the bill of lite and usefulness that makes my day!
"I didn’t want some Rachel Ray or fancy chef line of cookware. Saw this set of pans for the price, couldn’t pass it up. It was a huge upgrade to the crap I had. This set was so worth the price, the clean up on them are great. I got a little sloppy with pancakes one morning. Of course it dripped down the side of the pan and baked on the side while cooking. Cleaned right off no problem."
Some questions I had and did not get answered until putchase. Then found on the box Dishwasher safe: Yes Where is it made: China BakeLight handles: Yes  Next is the test as good pans are hard to find.
Best nonstick I’ve ever used and I have tried them all. You try to scramble eggs in any pan it winds up sticking. But after several months of using this and the scrambled eggs are not sticking.
"Great for cheap pans. Been using these daily for a month now. Pans heat evenly, the non stick works great, and they're easy to clean. I usually buy T-Fal but couldn't resist the price. Glad I got them as they're just as good. I'll stick to my cast iron for searing meat, but these are great for everything else."
"So far, these have been just great! We have had them for three months and they have held up well and are easy to use and easy to clean. We use the smaller one to make omelettes."
These are very nice pants nothing sticks to them they work great and very easy to just wipe clean
These are super nice. Good for a small home. People that are saying they flex are people who dont know a certain thing about pots and pans. Never wash a pan while its still hot. Most people know this but so many reviews are reviewing the product badly when they are participating in what I call USER ERROR aka idiot behavior.
Gifted these to my mom for Christmas because she was tired of all our old looking pots and pans. She loves them!! The turquoise is beautiful and such a great price for what you get!!!
Eggs in 90 seconds. I have used these for a month now and I could not be happier. They clean up easy and store great...
"I've used these every night for 3 months now and I've got to say they are the best non-stick skillets I've ever used, including the way expensive ones. They are heavy and we'll made, I was surprised considering how little they cost. Very happy with my purchase, would definitely purchase again."
Very inexpensive pans that work well on my induction cooktop. Easy to clean! I cannot comment on longevity as I have had them only for a month.
"Product came in perfectly, made a pasta meal and some tacos using the set and didn’t have any issues, but if any arise I’ll be sure to make an update to my review."
If you need nonstick pans buy these ASAP! These are so easy to cook with and even easily to clean.
"These things are freakin' fantastic. I bought them for $24.99 assuming they'd have some sort of drawback, either the non-stick-ness would fade soon after purchase or I'd somehow break them.  Neither of those things happened.  I'm very happy about this purchase. It's cheap. It's effective. Don't sleep on this."
"These pans clean up wiith a sponge, even after cooking scrambled eggs...or anything that used to be difficult to get off the pan surface."
"When I Tell You These Pan Are FREAKN Phenomenal . I Recieved My Pans Maybe Two Weeks Ago & When I Tell You These Pans Are GREAT . The Best Pans I Ever Bought . Food Don’t Stick . Easy To Clean , VERY NICE ; I Cooked The BEST PANCAKES IVE EVER MADE . Definitely Will Be Ordering More SOON"
Nice quality pans. Metal is thicker than on the low-end types. Non stick works fine. Only had these a few weeks so I can't comment on how durable the coating is
"Utopia kitchen is a brand that is new to me, I was not sure of the quality but it seems that they will last a long time. I bought a two quart pot before and I'm in love with it. I have been using it every day for over a month and still like new. If these pans are the same quality I know I'm going to like them a lot."
Got these frying pans about a month ago. They had a sale so I paid about $24 for the set of 3 I’ve used them pretty often since then and so far I love them! They are super easy to clean! Might buy another set for my mom since she liked them also. They have some scratches here and there then again I’m not super picky! For me it the way food cooks which is GREAT and clean along with the cleaning.
Best value for a medium-thick set of teflon pans! You can't beat that price! They have the reinforced bottom so pans don't buckle from excessive heat! And food just slides right off! Buy these pans!
"I was using those stupid ""copper"" pans for induction cooking. I got so tired of re seasoning for a nonstick finish I shopped. Found these, took a try, I have had no problems. Easy wash nobstick and very solid."
Excellent value. I'm super picky about my egg pans in particular. I had no idea this set was this great quality. They have the extra thick bottoms not only to help distribute heat. But make the pan much more durable. I'm so happy. I will buy again. Even if for a gift.
"This pan is great to make scrambled egg, but it makes very strong chemical smell after it is heated up for pancake. And it is very difficult to clean once there are burned starches from the pancake. I am worried there might be poisonous coating in it. So I am throwing it away for the safety of my families."
"I am very happy with this pan! I use it a every day. I will rebuy this again and again when the time comes.  I did have a couple of noticeable issues with ceramic coating that I saw when I first opened the box. The company contacted me to confirm I was happy with the pan. I informed them about the issues with the ceramic coating and they immediately apologized and replaced the pan with another which is in flawless condition.  They stood by the guarantee, it was awesome. If this was it, I’d be happy, but the pan itself is fantastic.  It has great heat distribution and it’s durable. It’s easy to clean, just use a soft sponge. To preserve the coating you have to use pliable utensils (I use bamboo) to prevent damage and your good. 10/10."
"I've been through a few nonstick pans in the last 2 years, and between them getting beat up easily, not really being nonstick, scratching, or my in-laws ruining them, I was determined to find a pan that could stand up to more than a gentle breeze while being non-stick and low maintenance. This is the one!!"
"Even with me taking great care, and only handwashing, after about four uses, it was stained. I should not have trusted a light-colored interior."
"EXPECTED TO RECEIVE A PAN THAT WOULD DO UNTIL I COULD BUY A NEW SET FOR NEWLY REDONE KITCHEN. THIS QUALITY OF THIS PAN US IMPRESSIVE. STURY, SOLID, AND GOOD LOOKING. WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THESE FOR MY NEW KITCHEN. REALLY LOVE IT."
Everything I cook steaks to this pan with or without cooking spray.
"I have one issue with this product, I have to hide it from my husband so he doesn't use metal utensils when cooking with it! I don't use oil in cooking and it is working beautifully."
Sometimes you just need a non-stick pan and this one is perfect.
"This is the best frying pan I have ever used! Hardly ever have to wash it, just wipe it clean."
"Easy to handle, cooks nice and evenly and cleans up in a snap"
Perfect and excellent price
Works great.
"Love it, easy to cook with. Hardly no oil or butter needed to cook with. Easy to wash."
"Item is described and advertised as ceramic PFAS free pan, however box it came in says this is an aluminum pan."
"I find nothing to dislike about this skillet. Sautee's beautifully, food tosses easily and slides off readily....."
Emits a strong chemical odor when heated.
Perfect non stick skillet.Love it!
I like it
I’m really happy with it.
This is a great pan ...heats up super fast but does have a chemical smell when cooking which is a concern of mine.
Love it really cooks an heat up well an no sticking
"I Use butter or oil, NOT spray like Pam and no dishwasher and should last a long time. Center of pan is hotter, adjust accordingly"
I haven't had any problems with this item
"Es muy practico ,Recomendable y bueno."
just great
Very durable and truly non stick surface
"This pan is great ,I love the ceramic inside easy to clean non stick. I just love it. Thank you."
Quality at a reasonable price
I don't do reviews That sad It the perfect skillet Keep it clean No dishwasher
Good product
Pretty light weight.
It is indeed a pleasure to use this non-stick frying pan. So easy to clean. Food does just slip off the pan. Just the right size too. I'm waiting for a sandwich grill to come out with this coating. ;-) (Meaning a smaller size.)
"I'm not sure this pan needs any more hype. You go on BIFL threads, see features, etc and all clad is top rated amongst brands. But I did want to say I suck at cooking, watched some YouTube videos on the water beading/murcury test (where you heat up the pan dry and wait until water makes a bead to add your oil and good) uh and when I tried it with my eggs it worked! Zero sticking! It was kindof insane and really cool too see. I'll update as I go on the whole longevity/stains but I kinda love it right now. If you're looking to get away from cheap, disposable non-stick pans go for it."
Probably my least used of the SS skillets because I’m either cooking a lot and use the 12” or making an omelette and use the 8”. That said this heats up faster than my 8” because I can use a larger burner and still does get used often. Don’t listen to the reviews by people who never used a pan made for adults before and don’t care to learn technique. Pan sauces are the bomb and clean your pan for you. Always preheat and always add an oil and never have an issue. I figured out the exact minimum time to preheat on my specific stove for each pan. They’re all different. Just YouTube away how to make a pan sauce and you’ll be reaching for SS pans all the time for cooking your proteins. Mine still looks new.
"I had been watching some cooking demos on-line in which the Chef used All-Clad products... I decided to treat myself to the 12 inch skillet... I have since purchased two more smaller skillets and am gradually replacing all my cookware with All-Clad. They are pricey but they're worth it. They look great, but more importantly, they cook great! I find I can cook at a lower temperature setting. I have fewer instances of food sticking to the surface, even though it's not a non-stick surface. Clean up tip... after using I let the pan cool for a few minutes while I'm plating the food, then I quickly run hot water in the still warm pan and hit it with the scrubbing wand... I then let it sit until after the meal and finish the clean-up. Also, ""The Bar Keepers Friend"" cleaning powder works excellent on these pans those rare times when I need a little extra clean up help."
"I use this pan for cooking on a glass cooktop. My dear wife ruined a couple of stainless steel pans with aluminum bases while she was getting used to this cooktop. Those pans ended up badly warped. I bought a Tramontina 3 ply skillet that performs quite well, but my wife didn't like it very much. She said it was too heavy and the flat part of the pan was too small because the sides of the pan were flared too much. This All-Clad pan is a bit lighter than the Tramontina pan, the bottom is slightly bigger and it comes with a nice lid. I'm not sure it performs any better than the Tramontina pan, but at least my wife will use this one. Unfortunately it is much more expensive so I hope it lasts a long time."
"This pan is a 3-layer sandwich -- aluminum core with two thin layers of stainless steel bonded, top and bottom. The bottom corner is slightly more rounded than with most skillets, making it perfect for omelettes, and the metal handle means you can put the pan under the broiler without damage to the handle. The pan thickness appears to be uniform (sides and bottom), but is thick enough to heat evenly. Stainless steel lid included.  The pan edge is not rolled (it's too thick to roll), and is the only place where the aluminum core is exposed. With age and corrosion the edge could become rough; this should require many years, and would be correctable with a little dressing with a file. This is the only shortcoming I've noted.  We bought this to replace a non-stick frying pan. The non-stick coatings always fail in a few years and then the pan become junk."
"This is a great high quality pan. I got it b/c these are the kinds of pans Ina Garten uses. But I had to educate myself on how to cook with and treat stainless steel. It looks like with some negative reviews here, I made the same mistakes at first. I did a seared salmon and finished it in the oven. It was excellent, the crisp crust it made on top was perfection, big difference b/w my non-stick pan. But the pan got very discolored, like a brown-caramel color all in the center, and it had rings of that brown coloring all around the edges. I thought I ruined it. Well, I discovered Bar Keeper's Friend along with a non-scratch scouring pad (Crown Choice was what I went with), and yes, I had to scrub hard for awhile to remove it, but I eventually got it looking like new. But I looked up how to cook with stainless steel. Here are some tips so this discoloration doesn't happen to you. Don't overheat the pan. What happened in my case was that the pan was overheated so the oil burned into it. You don't want to heat the pan past medium. It's best to cook on medium-low to medium, and adjust the heat if necessary. I wouldn't go anywhere past the 4 dial on your stove. It will be hot enough b/c of how it conducts heat. Another tip is to season it, which I also did. You can look up how to season. And doing this, the pan has worked so great, the best pan I've owned. I can even cook fried eggs in it and they don't stick."
"I've had this one day. I used it to make scrambled eggs, and for the first time ever they are all perfect, cooked the same way, uniformly. I've never imagined a pan can cook as uniformly. Usually it's easy to burn some edges, in just a few seconds. Not with this. I used butter under the eggs and cleanup was the easiest ever. I just needed a soft sponge to clean it. Very, very little of the egg was there, and that didn't really stick. I used to use butter with a teflon coated pan, and the protein in the eggs stuck like glue. Not with this. I'm surprised that it doesn't. Anyone who thinks all pans are the same, must think all cars are the same, all houses are the same, etc. They aren't. This is a bargain for the money, since the teflon pan, while much cheaper up front, is now in the garbage. This won't be. I would recommend do not use metal tools on it, or a scratch pad to clean it. These will make micro scratches that will enable, over time, the food to stick. This is much better than I expected, and the heat is evenly distributed, which I've never experienced before."
"I've been using non-stick pans for the longest time, then tried cast iron, and this is easily my favorite. I was going to get a lower cost option, but decided against and went with the ""one and done"" approach.  Completely worth it. Changed cooking for me. This heats up so well, even and quick. Browns and sears phenomenally, I'm looking at the french skillet and the sauce pans now."
"I have a glass cook top electric stove and this pan does not cause any scratches or otherwise mar the surface. It heats evenly and and gets hot quickly. The curved sides make it easy to stir sauces I'm making and nothing gets stuck in any corners, if that makes sense. My only issue is that I've had to use a little Barkeepers Friend, which is recommended on their website, to remove the last vestiges of meat I've cooked at higher temperatures. But on the flip side of that I can take this pan right to the oven or put under the broiler to finish off what I'm cooking. A big plus for me. Even though it says you can put it in the dishwasher I would never do that with a quality pan like this. I definitely would recommend this pan. I have the 7 1/2-inch and the 12-inch pans. I will be donating my older stainless steel pans and keeping my All Clad."
I hesitated spending so much money on a skillet but I had heard so much about them and how evenly they cook that I decided to give it a try. I had to season it well and have had to do it a couple of times since I got it but man! It cooks so beautifully and cleans up so nice. While you're cooking you have that nice frond and so it make delicious gravies and sauces. It's a quality piece to add to your chef's kitchen. It's my go to pan for searing meat and it can go straight from the stove to the oven. I LOVE IT! Hopefully I will have it for many years to come.
"Right out of the box we cooked some home fries. They had a horrible time of sticking.  I then went to YouTube and understood how to season allclad style pans. Noe not only fries, but eggs or anything I cooks does not stick.  Well tempture distribution all over the pan. Best pan for anything critric, tomatoes sauce etc. We love spaghetti, chili, etc.  Thank you for reading...."
"This is my first All-Clad skillet and I love it! This skillet with lid is great for cooking one box of Rice-A-Roni, spaghetti sauce, fried eggs (don't forget to warm-up pan with oil and it becomes the same as non-stick - eggs will just slide out of the pan). I also gave one as a gift and the recipient loves it, too!"
"I began with the purchase of a 2 quart pot because a friend who is a chef recommended All-Clad for quality and performance. Have thrown out the pan with the chemical coating. These pans are a pleasure to use. They have a nice 'heft' to them and distribute the heat beautifully so that cooking goes more quickly. At my first purchase, I went through sticker shock. I have found that Amazon has the best prices on these. All-Clad is worth the money. Efficient, very easy to clean and visually pleasing as well. ***If you have a small cooking space, keep in mind that the handles on the fry pans are very, very long. I ordered a pan as a 'used' item described as in 'very good' condition. It was in perfect condtiion."
"I bought one of these about 2 years ago. It looks good and it cooks good. I used it frequently and washed it in the dishwasher with Cascade. The aluminum middle layer eroded around the edge leaving 2 sharp steel layers around the rim which cut my finger. I contacted All-Clad and they had me return the pan at my expense. About 2 months later they sent me a new pan, with no comment. They advertise this as dishwasher safe, but it's not. If you get one you need to wash it by hand."
All Clad products are great for cooking. This fry pan with lid is not exception. Cook foods without using excessive high heat. Clean up a breeze. Would highly recommend
"It’s NOT for non-stick applications. Solid performer for Searing, cooking w/ oil, sauces, etc."
"All clad is the best most consistent cookware product available. Especially, those items made in the US."
"Awesome pan I can cook eggs without it sticking , and if you Read how to use it right this thing is fantastic I wish I bought one years ago. Definitely read the instructions that come with the pan and use it that way"
"Perfect! Non-stick from the very first use!! I love how with just a few drops of oil I Can make multiple items like eggs, pancakes, crispy thins without the hassle of sticking all over like with usual stainless steel. All this without worrying about my health as it doesn't come up with any harmful chemicals like non-stick pans!!!"
"It was well worth the cost. I bought two, they are my favorites now."
"Still the same high quality as my first All-Clad pan, bought over 30 years ago. This one is very light, and easy to flip. The 10 inch size is perfect for one or two person meals."
Use the mercury ball test to get the temperature right for no-stick.
Works great if you learn how to season it before cooking. All my cookware are of this brand and it specifically good on my induction cooktop which might save you a lot of money and don't care about that mirror finish gone after the while. Doesn't matter what you do and use to clean it up.
You’re here because this brand and pan are amazing. Great addition to your kitchen tools
I recommend this product highly
Always a good product! Very happy with it.
"Love it feels clean cooking non stick if you use it as instructed! I feel better using it as to non stick pans because of the poison from material used to make them and, stainless steel compared to aluminum."
The only reason I got this is because it's stainless steel inside and out.
"Cooking is a longtime hobby of mine. This All-Clad D3 Fry Lid, 10 Inch Pan, Dishwasher Safe Stainless Steel Cookware, Silver, 10-Inch is one of the best purchases I have ever made. My cooking just got that much better! Thanks! Deb Coltune"
It looks great but it is relatively easy to burn food on the bottom. The burnt food is very difficult to remove even with overnight soaking with a vinegar/soap mixture
"This is a great stainless steel fry pan but it takes rather a long time to heat up due to the thick bottom, which has an embedded aluminum layer. This does mean the temperature will not fluctuate much while cooking, a good thing.  If one comes to the AllClad pans after using teflon coated aluminum pans (even good Cephalon pans) some readjustment is in order. These take longer to heat up and they get hotter at a given cooktop dial setting.  For instance, I cook scrambled eggs in olive oil on a Cephalon pan at a dial setting of 6 on my GE glass cooktop. At that setting the olive oil never smokes and the eggs never burn. At the same dial setting the AllClad gets so hot (400° measured) that it smokes the olive oil and burns anything in the pan.  I recommend using a good infrared thermometer to gauge the actual temperature. Cleaning is not as easy as the promo videos show, at least not if you cook with olive oil or Crisco. Both will form a tan residue that requires some scrubbing with the AllClad cleanser or Bar Keepers Friend.  The upkeep on these is more than for teflon pans but these much more versatile and take abuse that would kill a teflon pan in no time flat."
Love the pan but returning it. I need the 12 inch
Worth the money and food tastes great with no added chemicals from a non stick. Buy one today. American made and designed.
"This fry pan surpasses my expectations!! So easy to use, clean and looks great!"
All clad is always great
No comments needed. It IS the best pan you can get.
Very nice even heat. High quality. I miss having a transparent lid to watch what I am cooking. I would buy this pan again.
"Love this pan! Cooks chicken and fish beautifully. Heats quickly and evenly. Not good for eggs (unless you are one of those magical people that can cook eggs in stainless steel). Cleans easily, doesn't scratch, looks beautiful."
Pan is really nice. Use some oil and things won't stick to bad. Get barkeepers friend to clean it and it will look new again
Easy to clean and distributes heat well
"What's not to love? Gorgeous, very well made, cooks evenly and quickly. It's All Clad. Can't go wrong."
EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT....
"By far the best deal I could find in All-Clad pans, given the included lid. The handle seems never to get hot."
Nice pan
Great pan. Heats evenly for uniform cooking. Worth price.
nice
Love it!
"These pans ( I have a few ) are terrific. They are gorgeous and are obviously built by people who care about what they make and sell. The pans are thick and distribute heat evenly, eliminating hot spots. They go from stove to oven and back with no problem. After use in the oven be careful not to grab the handle without protection. This is not a design or manufacturing defect. One just has to remember that a pot or pan which just came out of a 400 degree oven is hot.  My one point of dissatisfaction is the lids. On the plus side, they do seal well, yet they are still easy to put on and take off. Again, that is quality design and workmanship. But they are flat instead of domed. That limits the amount of food which can go in the pot or pan, and lessens the effect of the steam which builds up inside a covered pot or pan. My other dislike is the handles on the lids. They get quite hot, even when used only on a stove. And because they are short, it is difficult to put the lid on my counter ( upside down, which is proper technique ) without using both hands and a towel.  One more thing. I gave them only a mediocre rating for being easy to clean. That is because I clean them until they look just like they did when I took them out of the box. If I didn't go that far, they would be easy to clean. By the way, I recommend the All-Clad cleaner/polish. With patience and a little work, it makes my pots and pans look like new.  Will I buy more items from this company? I already have and I will continue to do so. Do I recommend them to others? Yes."
"Unlike my other All-clad pots and pans, this fry-pan developed brown stains very quickly that were extremely difficult to remove (took a lot of soaking with Barkeeps Friend). They developed after about a month of use, and were very unusal, almost like grease was burnt into the porous metal. VERY difficult to remove from the area where the handle meets the pan, and where the rivets are within the pan on the cooking surface.  It also developed a bubble on the exterior surface which seems like faulty metal, which was VERY surprising given this is a $100 pan. Seems like it could very well be a forgery, and despite saying 'All-Clad' / Made in USA, I'm highly suspicious. Not sure if somehow a third-party is selling fraudulent dupes via the 'All-Clad' store? I know it's not the first time I've received such items from Scamazon.  Needless to say, I'll be purchasing a replacement from a reputable source like Williams-Sonoma, or similar. Don't waste your time and money!"
"I always wanted an All-Clad stainless steel pan. We have a number of cheaper Cuisinart SS pans we've used for years, which are fine. But the quality of this All-Clad 10"" pan is on a whole new level. Eggs are non-stick (as long as you use the right technique). Heat is pretty even across the cooking surface, even on my electric flat top stove. My only complaint is the actual cooking surface on this 10"" pan is around only around 7 1/2 inches. The sides are sloped, which is nice for flipping food. Overall, great pan."
"have a teflon skillet, which is relatively easy to clean but may shed coating in the food I am cooking.  Then I have a cast iron skillet, which is relatively easy to clean since it never get scoured to the bare metal. But cast iron is heavy and tough on my wrists.  I have an All-Clad skillet which is light and doesn't shed toxic stuff in my food. But it is hard to clean (even with Bartender's Friend). My skillet is in the sink right now, waiting for me to try once again to scour bits of kale gnocchi off of it. What a pain!  I am a bachelor, utility chef, cooking quick meals mainly for myself. Were I into more complicated recipes, I might better appreciate the fine points of All-Clad. But for me, cast iron has it beat."
"This is just as good or as bad as any other stainless steel fry pan. Very disappointed by this purchase. It sure does the job that it is meant to do, but my other cheaper brands work equally. It is recommended to wash it by hand and that increases the work. Since everything sticks to it when greasing is less(like it would in any other pan) it takes a lot of elbow grease to get it clean. Been using it daily for the last 15 days and it has already lost its shine. I want to return it, but that seems unfair to me since I have used it so many times already. I Do NOT recommend this item. Calphalon/ Cuisinart are equally good. There is really nothing special about this one that you should pay twice the price."
"Pan works great. Heat distribution, durability, etc., etc.  However, the pan is difficult to pick up and maneuver. The shape of the handle is just - terrible. I would suggest that you go to a store and try this pan, and similar pans, in person. Place something in the pan to simulate the weight of food, then pick up the pan and try to maneuver it. Some pans handle well. This pan, handles terribly.  Would I recommend this pan to a friend - no."
"I bought this 10-inch skillet to replace the previous All-Clad skillet that I destroyed. On my first usage, I noted that the skillet wobbles, which my old skillet didn't. What this shows is that the skillet bottom isn't flat and doesn't maintain full contact with the heating element, which can produce uneven heating.  After reading a lot of postings by purchasers of these skillets in the various forums on the internet, in the interest of research, I wandered down the aisles of Williams-Sonoma testing the flatness of the bottoms of all the skillets and pans. Almost every one of them had a slight concave bottom, meaning the interior was slightly convex and explained why the oil rushes to the edges of the interior. The only exception was the perfectly flat bottom of the Williams-Sonoma brand of cookware, Thermo-Clad--but only some of them. There was variation from one pan to another. Edit: Demeyere is also perfectly flat.  My own 12-inch All-Clad is also concave, but extremely so. I could slide a ** US nickel ** through the gap, which means it's at least 2 mm out of flat. However, the 12-inch pan doesn't wobble, so convexity alone doesn't mean a wobble. Still, not being in contact with the burner is not desirable and doesn't meet their advertisement of a flat bottom. I sprinkled some flour evenly across the pan and put it on medium heat; after a few minutes, it turned brown pretty evenly across the pan, so it seems the convexity didn't affect the heat distribution of the pan.  So, in the end, it's not the convexity of my 10-inch pan that's the problem, but rather the bottom rim of the pan not lying in a plane. I've ordered a replacement and will return this one in the shipping boxes once I receive it.  Edit: New pan is pretty wobble-free."
"I don't understand why there is no warning about lid's handle. I almost burned my fingers first time when I used the pan! You have to use a towel or pot holder when you need to grab the handle. I put a wine cork which is not aesthetically pleasing, wish the handle was heat-resistant..."
"So, I really do not know what went wrong here. I bought these pans based on a very high recommendation and ended up sending them back because they are a disaster for cooking, especially cleaning. Now, after I sent them back I heard that I was supposed to have read the directions very clearly and follow them perfectly. I did not know that so perhaps I will give them a try again someday."
"Now that I’ve used it a few times the problem for me is the handle is too narrow. Yes, it does get wider as you go back, but moving back increases the weight. Don’t get me wrong its a well made pan that or great, but the handle design could use improvement. I was looking to buy American, while I will use the pen for searing, I wouldn’t buy again as I’m a pan tosser when sauteing"
"The lid does the basic function of its job and that's about it, gets hot pretty quick and is about as basic as they get. Handle is small and the overall width makes it uncomfortable with my larger hands. The indented design is too aggressive an doesn't help with grip as intended.  Pan cooks well, good quality stainless steel pan, unimpressed otherwise"
Very durable and heats quickly and evenly. Problem is cleaning and the amount of oil needed to make it stick less (not non-stick). Would rather use cast iron or a non-stick pan. Haven’t tried it in the dishwasher because I’m afraid it will discolor.
Rivets stick out 3/8” and are bent instead of compressed on the lid. The pan handle is extremely uncomfortable. The top indentation is way too deep and extends too far back which makes the ridges on the sides of the hole dig into your palm. I didn’t cook with it because I’m returning it to Amazon ASAP. Form follows function.
My mom specifically uses this good cook brand pan to make pineapple upside down cake she claims it’s the only one that works. the cakes amazing so I don’t question it at all... my dad used the pan to cut a tri tip in while barbecuing and ruined it so when I found them on Amazon I bought my mom four of them and she was happy and it’s exactly what she’s looking for
We have used this pan daily for about six months. It fits inside a counter-top toaster oven and is perfect. We have used it in our conventional oven and it does the job very well. We have used foil and sometimes parchment paper and both work well. I would buy again. It is a great size to make an individual pizza.
I bought this for brownies but than realized it was too small for the texture of brownies I like. But I will find many uses for this pan! I'm so impressed by the quality of this bakeware. As soon as you see it.. there's no mistaking that this is a well constructed item. Will definitely be looking into other pieces from this company!!!
"Held on to my ancient pans (I'm in my 70's) because I could never find small pans in local stores. FINALLY decided to check out Amazon. Bingo, there they were! Good price, GREAT product! I love my new pans! Bye bye old ones!"
Does what it's supposed to do! They bake my brownies wonderfully!
I needed a pan this size for a brownie dessert recipe. I ordered it here and it arrived within a day. Pretty cool! The pan is well-made and my dessert was amazing. This pan is also a great size for making homemade protein bars (I divide the finished bars into 12 servings).
"I ruined my first pan by leaving it on the bottom shelf of my oven. Even though it can still be used and didn't burn, it just left brown spots all over the pan that looked unattractive ... so I ordered another one and will take better care of it. It is the most perfect pan for brownies,small cake or biscuits. I will never be without this particular pan!"
"these are the best pans so far . wish there was other pans,pots,and 5qt. pans from this maker"
"This pan fits my toaster oven perfect and the quality is very nice. I have not had it a long time, but I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it. It does not stick and clean up is a breeze."
"Lightweight, perfect size and easy to clean"
"The pans clean so easily, nothing sticks to them, They look great and are a nice weight without being too heavy."
"Works well for small foods - biscuits, small foods. I did scrape too hard and it left a rust mark."
Easy to clean surface. Sturdy enough considering the thickness. Bakes evenly I am very happy with it. Great value for good price
"Just the right size for one person to use. I broil, bake and warm food for myself in it."
Is what I needed to bake my split top hot dog buns
"Love this pan, and stuff dont stick as much"
So happy I found this cake pan for less than $3...awesome..I'll be getting more now
Got this for baking and works well. I usually put down an aluminum foil layer so I don't have to clean the pan.
I own 2 of these pans and they are outstanding for cooking a small meal and baking.
Purchased just for me ! Just the right size for a little roast for a single guy. Also bought the small rack that will go inside.
We were able to cook two small turkeys in one oven. Turkeys turned out great. Very happy with purchase/
Nice heavy pan that cleans up easily. Perfect size for halving a 9x13 casserole.
Nice pan for the money. Just what I was needing to replace a 30 yr old one. Thanks
Better than expected. Good pan for the money.
They were exactly what I wanted and could not find locally anywhere
great size when cooking for 2
very sturdy and well made and easy to clean
Great pan for the money. Already used it a bunch of times and holding up great.
This is just the right size for a couple and works well in the toaster oven that we have. These have a nice nonstick finish that last a long time.
Great pan
Very well made pan and the exact size I wanted. I have used it a few times already and it seems like a good quality pan. I would recommend.
Nice!
Love my new cake pan
"shipped safely, glad to have this size in my repertoire."
Baking
Its great
size
This pan was just the size I needed. I love it
"I have used this twice now and love it. Basic pan which is what I was looking for to replace an old one. This one cleans so easily. I cooked greasy cheesy casserole in it and it cleaned up quickly. My old pan I would have to soak and scrub. This one most of it came off with just a rinse. And the rest with a 10 minute soak, no scrubbing"
"Relatively expensive. Disappointed in fragility of coating, and in its tendency to stain - I cannot get it back to as-new appearance. The fragility steers me away from aggressive scrubbing, so that bottom corners tend to collect some residue over time. VERY nice for cooking, and a handy size. I use it at least 4 times weekly."
"I really like this pan for baking fish. The pan cleans up easily and I have learned my lesson from the first of these pans I owned. Do not put in the dishwasher - it easily rusts if you do. However, it's very easy to clean. I especially like the pan because it is durable yet so lightweight."
I ordered the lasagna pan. On the product description of the dimensions it says the pan is 14x10x6.7 inches but it’s not that size and it’s actually 14x10x2 inches. I haven’t used the pan yet so I don’t know how well it will hold up when I do use it and the only experience I’ve had with this product so far is the size of it. So if someone is looking at this pan and it’s size-its not the size that is given on the product description
"I had a pan this size which was great for brownies in lieu of the 8"" x 8"" size for brownies as the brownies are not so thick. Well it rusted and the hubby uses it in his workshop. So glad to have found this one."
Non stick coating peeling after only two uses. Won't but this brand of pan again.
"I could not believe the price on these pans, what a deal!! They are fabulous for brownies! Buy these, you wint be sorry!!"
after 3 months the coating has started to peel and the metal has started to rust. I cleaned them in my dishwasher and never used metal utensils in them. They were great while they lasted but now are trash.
I must always remember to use coated plastic utensils when removing baked items or metal will scratch it's coating.
90% stick free
I love the pans. They were just what I wanted. Thank You.
"After trying various cake pans, I enjoy this brownie pan. Let me tell you: I make brownies often and have used cake pans only to have the brownies rise up like bread! (This, even after following the boxed brownie instructions.) I got this pan and like that the pan stands shorter than a cake pan. So when I made my brownies this morning, they came out good! Nice size and soft.  The only catch here is that the pan is a little larger than advertised. It's 13 by 8, and that makes a difference. When I used my old 6 by 6 brownie pan, they were always rich and gooey. Now with 13 by 8 I get double the brownies but they aren't as decadent, rich, or gooey. Just semi-rich"
"This is actually going to be a Christmas gift for someone who said they had a recipe for a 7x11 pan and they didn't have one, so I have not used the pan. It appears very well made, sturdy, and looks as though it would be very easy to wash."
I'm so glad I found this pan. I needed this size to fit a cooking rack I have but could not find it in the stores. So excited this was available. I love this brand because it's so easy to clean.
"I tried to use this baking pan to roast pork and beef. I recommend to use aluminum foil with it, otherwise all the crust will stick on the baking pan and making cleaning extremely difficult. The pan is a little bit small, but it is enough for you to cook 4 chicken wings each time."
"Love this pan. Heavy, non stick. I will definitely buy more from this seller."
"These are excellent baking pans. I would definitely recommend them and if I need other types, I will buy this brand again..."
I wanted a pan that was smaller than 9x13 so that my brownies wouldn’t come out so thin. I love the size of this pan—it’s perfect!
Roasted vegs biscuits
I need another!
Easy to clean nonstick surface
"Since there’s only two of us, it’s perfect for carrying the grilled meat to the table."
I would recommend this pan to anyone. It is made really well. I will be using it to make small lasagnas & to bake brownies.
Nice product.
"I changed my review from an original 5 star to 2 stars because after only a couple months, a few uses, and hand washing, the pan is rusty and the bottom is peeling. It's a fine pan if you only plan on using it once or twice."
"This pan is the perfect size for my toaster oven, and replaces the crummy pan which came with the oven. I'm very pleased with it."
Its the perfect size for making biscuits
came quick-cleans up nicely & food comes out of pan easily
"Easy to clean, light weight, 2 pans and good size!"
It didn't fit in my toaster oven and it was slightly damaged. I am returning it tomorrow.
Great little pan. Crazy easy cleanup.
I bought this because the dimensions claim to be 14x10x6.7 it is definitely not 6.7 inches deep. I wanted for lasagna but it us just as deep as my 9×13 baking dish. It is a very nice size otherwise.
"First, I did not receive these products for free, I bought them. The Simply Calphalon was rated a best buy by CR and I thought that the specs for the Kitchen Aid"
This set is terrible!! The color came off on the first wash! I contacted the manufacturer with my concerns and they didn’t even respond! Terrible service terrible product
"I've had a Calphalon Simply 12"" Everyday Pan for years and l Iove it. Decided I needed to invest in the same series for a pot and pan set. I couldn't be more pleased. Some of the Calphalon Set Reviews are hit or miss, but I knew that I wouldn't be going wrong if I got the same simply series as what I have been using! Great purchase and the price was unbeatable! It heats evenly, the non-stick is awesome. Even if it does stick without the use of any kind of oil, you can use silicone utensils to scrape it without damaging your pan. Love them!"
"I was excited to order this set to replace our much loved Simply Calphalon pots that have served us well over the years. What came was a box of someone's mismatched, used cookware without the lids and most of which wasn't Simply. We're not sure if it was a Calphalon error or an Amazon Fulfillment error, but someone isn't checking people's returns before they're sent out to new customers. Very disappointed."
"Quality is ok, but this is made in China not in Toledo OH as the description and the Calphalon website implies"
"Caphalon never disappoints. This brand is reputable for it's high quality products. I had this item back in college when living with boyfriend. I had them for 5yrs and they were still like brand new as the first day I brought them. So now I needed new pots and pans because I was tired of buying the cheap sets Farberware you get from Wal-mart. Those cheap brand only lasts a year or two then you have to go buy new ones again. So I decided to invest in this brand again. I'm so glad I did. Upon receiving this item, I immediately can see how highly detail the quality is compared to the cheap ones. This pot looks like it'll last me another 5yr or more. Definitely worth paying a little more for the investment then buying cheap sets at Walmart that costs $69-$89 and last for only a year."
Lid shattered while cooking! I was cooking spaghetti (on low) with the lid on the sauce and it cracked and shattered the entire glass lid! :(
"I love these pots and pans! My roommate had ceramic pots and pans- I hated them- they are hard to clean, and if you try to scrub them at all, it left scratches. I got frustrated with trying to prevent scratches after cleaning up from cooking things like rice and macaroni, so I purchased this set. I love the set! No matter what I cook, cleaning them is so easy. I just put the pan under water and use a sponge to wipe, and it's over. The pans still look brand new- no scratches, and no wasting time anymore with trying to soak and then gently scrub. I would get this set, but try to gravitate towards the set that has the no-boil over inserts. It's the same price."
I have had my basic Calphalon for 17 years. So it was finally time to get some new pieces. My previous set I actually only got rid of two pieces and still kept the rest bc they are still in fantastic shape. I bought these during covid and have cooked on them almost every day since March. The summer crop of beans and corn cane in and I cooked down 24 dozen ears of corn in my big Calphalon pot. No burning or sticking at the bottom. I truly won’t get a different brand.
"I got these on Black Friday (and if you’re reading this close to November, I would definitely wait! The sale was HUGE). I love them! I had my last Calphalon set for 9 years, but most of that was college where it was beaten up pretty bad! My roommates and I used metal spoons and scratched the bottoms, so it was time to get a new adult set. My only warning would be the size of the saucepans. They are smaller than I would have liked. The tiny one literally holds a can of beans and that’s it. And the bigger one holds maybe 3 cans of beans. So I ended up keeping my old large saucepan. Also, I read a lot of calphalon reviews and this one was listed for a “novice cooker”. I cook 2-3 times a week for dinner, and every morning eggs for breakfast. I would say this is a nice set! Fancier would have been unnecessary money spent."
"I've had this set for just under a year, and I use them regularly (I cook a few times/week). I also followed all of the care and usage instructions - no metal utensils, wait for them to cool before cleaning, and using dishwasher detergent + non-abrasive sponge to hand wash them. While most of my pots and pans are still in good shape, a couple of them are no longer non-stick. I didn't notice any peeling or other issues; they simply stopped being nonstick and I have to use lots of oil/butter to prevent my food from sticking, and even then it often doesn't work."
"Great set of pots and pans. I got this set to replace my old (identical) set that cost twice as much. The only reason I replaced them was to move the old set to our family lakehouse. They are great quality, but 1 or 2 of the older ones have warped a little over time. I do think it was my fault, though. I was young and new to cooking and would put really cold water directly into a dry/scalding hot pan to clean it. I didn't realize that the pan should cooled before dunking it. Oops! That being said, all of the old pans are still in good condition and are still usable...they just wobble a little bit on a flat surface. Be aware that this one did not come with the big (maybe 12"") saute pan. The description was accurate, so I'm not sure why I expected to get that one. I love the 10"" with raised edges. Great quality!"
"I found a non-stick wok style pan years ago... it was a different brand, it lasted a while and then started to stick, I bought another... that lasted a while and started to stick... I got one of those copper ones... it couldn't handle the high temps I use when I cook... and it started to stick... I was on Amazon a couple years ago and I saw the Calphalon Signature Hard-Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Flat Bottom Wok ... I thought what the heck... I bought one... WOWZERS was I pleasantly surprised. This pan fit my hand, handled the temps I like to use when I cook, it’s solid and it cleans up nicely… well, I liked it so much I bought another to use at my father-in-law’s house when I went to help care for him… then I bought another one just in case something happened to one of the others… it’s still in the box… I now have an entire set of them and will probably buy more as needed. If I ever decide to venture away from the world of non-stick… I would try Calphalon pans FIRST!!!"
"We built a new house last year and my old pans had seen their better days, so I ordered these pans. I have been using my new pans for a few months now and they are holding up really well. I only hand wash the pans, which is fine with me, because there are only 2 of us, but if I had a large family, I would probably want ones that you could put in the dishwasher. I do, however, put the lids in the dishwasher and they seem just fine."
"I purchased these years ago as my first real adult set. They have lasted me almost 15 years! I have taken zero care with them, lol, they go in the dishwasher and sometimes I use metal tools on them. Somehow they have survived and they are still in pretty good shape. So when I decided it was time to buy a new set I came right back to these. If they lasted that long when I didn’t care for them, imagine how long they will last now that I’m aware of how to care for them!"
"I enjoyed this set so my when I purchased it in 2009 that I bought it again this year when my set started showing some age. Still useful, I gave the old set to a friend of mine and bought the same set again plus a 12"" pan with cover and a 7"" deep sauce pot to recreate the full set (which are now not included the in set but were when I bought it in 2009). I look forward to another decade plus of use."
"First, I did not receive these products for free, I bought them. The Simply Calphalon was rated a best buy by CR and I thought that the specs for the Kitchen Aid KitchenAid KCH1S10KD Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set - Black Diamond made them worth consideration. I have been in the restaurant business for over 30 years so I have a lot of experience with pans, mostly professional sets. So that is my point of reference. The Calphalon and Kitchen Aid were in the same mid-range price point (170 - 220) in November of 2015. Truthfully they are very similar but not equal.  First thing I noticed was that the Simply Calphalon were slightly smaller. Especially the Saute pan. The Kitchen Aid set is dishwasher safe, Calphalon is not. For better or worse (as you'll read better in this case) the Kitchen Aid are heavier. The Calphalon are double-coated nonstick, the Kitchen Aid are triple-coated. Packaging for KA says oven safe to 350 degrees and Cal. says 400. Amazon says 500 for KA vs 400 for Cal. Being curious I had both in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes with no issues. Both are Hard Anodized aluminum. If you have an"
"I purchased these to replace a set of Miracle Maid pans I have been using for 50 years. This set is a close match to my old set which I loved. I have used the frying pans several times and am thrilled they are really nonstick. So far, the rest of the set has lived up to my expectations. I didn't think I would ever find a set that I could be happy with after using the miracle Maid, but this set is great. Highly recommend these pans."
I’ve been buying nothing but calphalon since 2001 and really enjoy them. These pans have a rubber grip on the handles that I prefer to the previous ones I had because the gas stove heats up the handles sometimes.
We really love this cookware. The only thing I can say negative about it is it is not dishwasher safe which is disappointing. It distributes heat evenly with no sticky mess afterwards. It is a heavy gauge steel with heavy-gauge handles and quality glass lids period it cleans up like new. For the money I think this is one of the best products out there. No comparison to a $80 set of T-fal. The quality of this Calphalon product is far and above anything that you would find in this price range. I would definitely recommend and will be buying more in the future
"It is missing a great big 12 inch pan, but otherwise this does the trick. And for the price i paid on cyber monday, it is a great deal.  Follow the seasoning directions. But i cook omlets with no oil or butter and they slide right off.  And remeber, never set your stove past 5 unless you are boiling water"
"So far these are awesome. The only thing I’d mention is to not let them sit with moisture on them for too long…I left one of the smaller pans in the sink overnight and it already appeared to have started getting a small rust spot. It mostly came off after washing, though. And since I would count that as minor user error, these are fantastic!  I am taking great care to store them separately from the rest of my pots/pans to keep their quality pristine, and as long as you use silicone or plastic utensils for stirring/flipping/etc, and hand wash them, I am thinking that these will last us a long time!"
"I LOVE these pots and pans! I purchased them for my cottage because the stove uses propane and the regular Calphalon from my main home were burning the food (even on low), plus the propane was leaving a residue that was difficult to scrub off.  I took those back to my house and bought this non-stick set for the cottage. They are very attractive and I really like the glass covers. I've cooked with them over the past several weekends and find that they cook very evenly. The handles stay cool and the propane residue washes right off. With the propane it's hard to regulate the heat, so I wouldn't stay that nothing sticks, but they do clean up easily. They hang beautifully on the hooks above the windows also.  With Calphalon you never want to put them in the dishwasher and that may be the source of some of the poor reviews I've seen. These are great pans and now I'm considering selling my regular Calphalon and buying this non-stick set for my home!"
This product is Great. I purchased it on cyber Monday for a steal for my vacation home. I check periodically to see if they go back down to $139.00 so I can buy my daughter a set. The quality and the pieces are top notch
"I've always been a fan of Calphalon and these don't disappoint. They ship very well packed with most the material being cardboard. The pots and pans have pretty thick bases so they take alittle longer to heat up than some other pans that I've used. The plus side is that there are no hotspots and they all heat up very easily.  I also like the fit of the lids. They're fairly heavy and have a nice snug fit, holding in steam very nicely. The handles also don't get hot, which is nice.  I want to be clear that the only reason I'm giving this set 4 stars is that they are only rated to 450 degrees in the oven. I'm assuming it's because there is silicone on the handles. It's great for controlling heat and being nonslip, but it limits the temperature that they can be used in the oven.  I would highly recommend this set to anyone looking for something nonstick. They've performed flawlessly and the price is unbeatable."
I’ve been married for 25 years and I’m still using the pans I received as a wedding gift. So obviously time to upgrade… Ordered these pans and I’m so pleased with the quality! They do such a great job of cooking my food evenly and without burning anything. Very easy to clean. I’ve been hand washing them to Ensure they last longer
"This is a nice set, it doesn’t feel as heavy as other calphalon sets but it’s nice nonetheless. I’ve used the frying pan in the oven and my steak came out perfect. This is a good set for a young/new family or people who don’t need to cook a large amount of food everyday. These pots are ideal for cooking for 2-3 people."
I am so glad I ordered this set . I had purchased some other frying Pans that claim to not stick or anything but they did. So far this has been a blessing no sticking very easy cleanup and they handles do Stay cool I love to see it because you have everything that you would need in a set of pants I had a good price
"I didn't want to be premature in reviewing this purchase. But I have had the chance to use almost all the cookware, and I am very pleased with heat distribution and the taste of the food when cooked. Will they hold up, or retain the non-stick condition? That's a later review."
This the perfect set for me with everything i wanted. I ended up getting a 3 Qt Stainless Steel and Non-Stick from separate makers but who can beat the price of this set. Handles DO NOT get hot whatsoever. The weight of them is nice as well as they are not as heavy as my individual Analon pieces which i have a few as well. Great Value and great product! You cannot lose with this one especially when it was on sale at $113!
I absolutely love these pots and skillet non sticks DO NOT USE PAM ON THESE AT ALL. I wish they put another pot in this set instead of so many skillets that’s the only downfall for me I would buy any of these again. ******
I hate to cook but I love these pans. It’s the first decent set I’ve had in years. Heat distribution is even. Love the extra handle on the large pan. No sticking. Easy to clean. I do not put these in the dishwasher. Highly recommend!
Calphalon makes a great product according to my sisters. After inspecting their sets I took the big leap. A quality product.
"We bought a stainless steel set before this and they were junk the same day. These, on the other hand, stay as clean as soap washing soap. I’m half tempted to drop some epoxy in the pan just to see if it rinses out once it’s cooked. The sizes are great. The pot is tall more than wide which is smart, leaves more room for the other burners."
"I wish that I had gotten these pots and pans sooner. They truly do not stick with burnt food nor food that has cooked a little too long. Clean up is amazing, I can either just wipe out the pot or pan with a dry cloth or actually put it in warm soapy water which I prefer or the dishwasher. Either method will do. I have used similar products that claim the same thing but, did not live up to the hype."
Good quality cooking utensils. I wish they made this good quality pots and pans where you could put them in the dishwasher instead of hand washing
This pot set is very well constructed and my wife loves them for their heating and ease of cleanup. They are the best pot set for the buck!!
"Totally worth the buy. I got them on sale because but they're totally worth full price. Super easy to clean, nice and heavy. They may not be super high end but honestly, they're the nicest pots and pans I have ever owned and I don't have any gripes with them. I feel like they cook really evenly and are all a really good size."
"I’ve owned Calphalon for years but wanted to replace them with something less heavy. These are significantly lighter, easier to clean, and work great. Haven’t owned them long enough to comment on durability but I’m not worried."
"My husband has always done the cooking in the house. I have watched him for many years look at Calphalon Cookware and he always has a reason ""not to buy it"" or wait. Well I bought this for him at Christmas and he LOVES it! He was very surprised and it is very high quality. I comparison shopped and the same exact set at a big box retailer the cost was more than it was thru Amazon. Had no problems with shipping and he is very happy. Finally after 22 years of watching him use crappy cookware he has a good set! My only dislike is it isn't dishwasher safe, but that's ok. We have a rule in our house, if you cook, you don't have to clean. So I don't mind doing the dishes after dinner, I can make sure that it is cleaned properly."
"Love this set. I've had Cuisinart stainless steel and HATED it. This is waaay better and I love the black color. I only wish that it had a saucepan that was a little large that the largest one this comes with as sometimes it's a bit small for certain tasks. Super easy to clean, nothing sticks to it. The sizes are great if you're cooking for one or two people, maybe three, above that, your pans will be crowded or you'll have to cook in batches."
I’ve always used a slap him pans so when my daughter said she needed new one I bought her this set. Good quality for the price. Easy to clean and cook with.
"These are not quite as nice as another Calphalon set I had years back, but this was less than half the price. They are pretty sturdy and look good."
"I replaced a set made by a chef who sells on QVC , the handles and lids got hot and burned my hands , unless I used a potholder, and they were not easy to clean. My set of Calphalon is great, the exact opposite of the pans I replaced. Highly-rated by me!"
"We purchased one skillet about a year ago and liked it so much, we ordered the complete set. Very durable and easy to clean."
""
"I am absolutely content with this order. I did read a few unsatisfied reviews but I disagree with most. I previously brought a large pot and pan by this brand a couple of years ago which worked wonderfully for me and my parents continue to use them today. I bought this set for my first apartment and I could not have made a better choice. The sizes work well for a single or couple, but a larger family would need larger sizing."
"I bought this set on a Daily Deal for a really good price last year(cough..1/2 the price). It is a medium thickness product. It's not like the old heavy ones from a few years ago, but not to 'junky' light either. I've been happy with the purchase and I would recommend this set to anyone who needed a new set of pots and pans. I have found no issues with any of the pieces. Lids all fit well and the pots and pans appear to heat evenly. I'd drop 1 star if I had to pay more, but ..5 stars for me!"
"Waited a long time to replace my cookware because I wasn't sure what I wanted. Then I used these at the house where my daughter is house-sitting, and really liked them. They are ""tough"" and clean easily and you can see the food through the glass lids and best of all, the silicone on the handles means you can touch and move the pots and/or lids while hot on the stove without getting burned. Found mine ""used"" in Warehouse deals, so got a great bargain, too. Win-Win!"
"My old set of cookware was in need of replacement as the teflon finish in the skillet was starting to look rough. After some research on the internet, I decided on this set. When the set arrived I was amazed at how light the pans, skillets, and pot were. I was even more amazed at how quickly they heated and how even the heat was distributed over the bottom surface. Cooking with these pants is a pleasure and has improved my cooking and the food I prepare."
Some information about this product for consideration factors pertaining to.This product simply calphalon is not in production any more.Going to costco there is currently a set that costs considerably less.One must be aware of the differences.I did lengthy review on those found.When looking at all reviews one had said something about hands getting burned in touching handles and lids.That is what makes SIMPLY calpholon unique.Classic set cheaper.This product has silicon on handles and when properly handled does not burn your hand.Best set of pans Iv'e owned yet Hand wash only!10yr wnty. Thank You for reading
I have been buying this product for years. The pans are real workhorses and it is a pleasure to cook in them. I purchased an extra set which gives me great flexibility when preparing meals. I highly recommend this product.
"Fantastic set. I've roasted, baked, fried, seared, and sauteed and these pots & pans seem to get better with use. I know they're only heat-safe to 400° but I've definitely broiled in the large pan and all was well. They clean up very easily and are heavy and solid. Excellent value for the price."
Love the ease of cleaning!Cooks very well. My daughter was using them one evening and thought she was in wonderland! The rice starch wipes right out of the cold pot! Eggs slide out! Excellent for every level of cooking.
"There’s nothing to dislike about these pans. They are a high quality and so easy to clean, even when you have burned on soy sauce. Everything cooks really good on the frying pans, even with an electric stove it heats evenly. It’s so nice to have good quality pans!"
I love them. They are solid and easy to clean. I bought one that said used but they were new in the original box.
"I've been using Calphalon stainless for years and finally got a set of non stick. This is a great brand and will last forever. The stainless has been nothing but great except for the fact that they easily burn things due to the good conductivity. The nonstick set I recieved is beautiful Calphalon quality and from the little use I've gotten so far they work great. They heat up fast and nothing has stuck to the inside with using very little oil. You do want to cook at a lower heat with these pans of using a radiant cook top, they keep heat very well. The only way I see these losing quality is if they're cared for improperly. I usually don't wash anything by hand, if it fits in the dishwasher you best believe it's going in. These pots and pans will never go in there though. Certain detergents will damage nonstick pans (father is a professional appliance repairman so I know what these cleaners do to dishwashers also) so I suggest always hand washing of you want your non stick to last. Also use only wood or non metal utensils or you'll have a scratched up ruined pan. These of course aren't professional grade pans so don't expect them to out perform the best of the best, but for the price these are some of the best you can get. My stainless set has lasted for years, even through the dishwasher, and there isn't a single piece that has anything wrong with it. If you're looking for a great quality set that will last I highly suggest anything by Calphalon. Unless you're a professional chef and have to have 15 layers of metal surrounding a copper core that was hand forged in Europe somewhere, this is one of the best sets you can have in a home kitchen."
I purchased Simply Calphalon pots and pans set. Pans and pots are great and work as advertised. Only issue is that it would be nicer to have a few larger pans in a set.
I love these I use them ALL the time they’re perfect and easy to clean and they don’t stick!!
I owned one Calphalon 10” pan before I bought this set. My only complaint was that the old pan had sharp points on the end of the handle. I was pleased when I unpacked these to find that the handle was redesigned and are now nice and smooth.
I love this product! It was recommended to me by my son and I intend to get additional pots. Cleaning is simply an easy swish in warm water. I dry them and immediately put them away! So Quick! No burnt residue on the pans and you don't have to use oil. Amazing!
"I have always used Cast Iron to cook with. Having some shoulder issues and really needed something a little lighter. These pots and pans are fantastic. I love how even they cook, how much lighter they are and the durability of them! Great sizes and they go into the oven like cast iron! Best Buy for the money. Couldn’t be happier!"
Wife and I really like these pots and pans! No need for extra oils or butters. Very very easy to clean. The only thing is the little frying pan does not come with a lid! But still have to give this set a 5 star rating!!
I like everything about these pots and pans. The lids make it easy to see what I’m cooking. The handles on the lids and the pans never get hot
"These are so easy to clean, heat evenly and I love the heat resistant handles."
"This is my second purchase of this set. I'm VERY happy with it. The first set was still nearly perfect after 2 years until my cat sitter decided to whip mashed potatoes with metal beaters inside 2 of the pans. The destruction was completed when she put the whole set in the dishwasher and etched the lovely exterior anodized finish. So, that set has been handed down to my daughter and I purchase a new replacement set. So here's some easy tips: It will last forever if you don't use metal utensils. 1) When you buy this set, also buy a nice set of silicone or plastic non-scratch kitchen utensils. Flipper, rubber scraper, and spoons are pretty common, but also get a whip, a spaghetti scoop, and a pair of tongs [this is where my husband started to fail with not using metal, since he'd grab the metal tongs or whip before I added these]. Amazon has great deals on all of these. 2) The non-stick coating is so great that the food almost repels right off the interior. So, just don't let stuff cook onto the exterior. If it does, just soak for a few minutes... and clean with Dormond cleaner made by Calphalon; http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Dormond-Hard-Anodized-Cookware-7-Ounces/dp/B0000CFH36/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1418841771&sr=1-1&keywords=calphalon+cleaner but whatever you do, don't put in the dishwasher. The chemicals will damage the exterior finish and this voids your very good warranty. Enjoy cooking in your new Awesome Cookware... also makes a great gift!"
"Honestly, these pots were recommended to me by my mother. I had always been a fan of the copper technology, but this cookware is better than anything else I have ever used! never a problem to clean and non-stick like I want."
This is my second set of Calphalon. I highly recommend them. I love the soft padded handles. Food cooks beautifully in these pots and pans. You won't regret your purchase!
"I have given away my other set of cookware. I refuse to use it again as - for the price - this 10-piece set of Simply Calphalon is perfect in my home. I like the sizes of each piece, not gigantic pots that come out once every two years and then return to the back of a kitchen drawer to just take up space. Just love these."
"I have the same collection that I bought in 2005. The difference is amazing. Items I still use from 2005 are heavier, bigger, still effective today. This new collections works and works well."
"Before buying this cookware, I read quite a few reviews, both good and bad. I have to say that I am very pleased with this purchase. Not only is this Gotham Steel cookware attractive, it is extremely non-stick, easy to clean and it distributes heat evenly and quickly.  I've come to the conclusion after using it for a while now, that people who complained about food burning or sticking were just using this cookware improperly. Because the heat distribution is so superior, you don't have to cook your foods at as high a temperature. For instance, when making scrambled eggs, I put the frying pan on the burner to heat up while I am scrambling the eggs. By the time I finish prepping them, the pan is heated. After I pour the eggs in, I am able to turn the burner off and cook the eggs with just the residual heat. I also like to add shredded cheese to my eggs to melt into the scramble. The eggs and cheese just slide right out of the pan perfectly.  I wash these pots and pans by hand because they are so easy to clean, it just takes a few seconds. The cookware is also nice and light, very easy to handle. The glass lids are vented so they don't steam up too much. My only complaint would be that the handles on the lids can get a little hot, but, this is a small criticism.  All in all, I have to say that I am 100% pleased with Gotham Steel and I would recommend them for anyone who wants to replace or upgrade their cookware."
"I've had this cookware set for about a month now and it totally lives up to the level of non-stick shown in the commercials if you understand it's limitations being that some of the tourture they put these though I wouldn't dare try. I've made these mistakes so you don't need to.  First, I'd highly recommend omitting any instructions to oil the pan in any recipe. Oli is still ok to use as an ingredient in the food just don't put it directly in the pan. Oil retains heat and may cause hot spots on the pan above the 500°F tempatures the coating on these pans is rated for.  Second I'd recommend using the lowest stovetop tempature you can easily get away with, this is again because of the 500°F tempature rating. At least on my own electric stovetop, the pan can easily get over 500°F when the stove is set to max without any food or oil. On electric stoves Medium-High or 7-8/10 is typically hot enough for any recipe calling for a high burner if you add an additional minute or two and is just below the 500F limit I measured these tempatures with an infrared thermometer gun after remembering the marketing material saying ""safe up to 500""  I was concerned at first about comments about the handle getting hot when the pan is in use but it never seems to be dangerously hot to where to would burn, nor uncomfortable to move from burner to burner. Would I want to lift the pan and take it out to the dining room to serve the food at stovetop tempature? No, but an oven mit could easily address that problem if I'm entering guess and serving them stove to plate.  Lastly, is more of a why not than an actual care tip. The pans cool down so quickly, you might as well clean immediately after use or maybe one to two minutes after use instead of waiting 5-10 min like I used to with traditional Teflon. Cleaning really is as easy as shown in the commercials if you've followed the other steps I mentioned above. Just rinse and use a sponge to knock food particles loose, shouldn't even really need to scrub. I've even used water and a paper towel on occasion.  Hope you find these care tips that the manufacturer didn't provide us useful."
"I have resolved myself to the fact that no pot or pan will ever be perfect and everlasting. That being said, I wanted to find some decent pieces that would be easy to clean, free of all the bad stuff, and last a while. We cook all the time, and we have had these pans since January. If I had paid more, I would probably be disappointed, but because they are so economical, I am really impressed and happy with this set. We've used every piece dozens of times. We have only hand washed with a washcloth, but I literally can't think of a reason you would ever need to do more, because everything just falls of them. We always use a little oil or butter, I have never had a single sticking issue. The handles can get a little warmer than I'd like but, again, nothing is perfect. I have never tried them in the oven, though they say they are safe up to 550F. We do not use metal utensils anywhere near these pans and months later we only have one pot with the tiniest of scratches (that I think came from something that was in the sink with it, and nothing to do with cooking). This is a great set, would absolutely recommend."
Love everything about this set. It is fun to cook again. Cleaning is a breeze! Cooking is always perfect and being able to prepare food Cooking only on medium heat and having them cook faster and more evenly is awesome. Highly recommend. I am an elderly woman with arthritis and the weight of these pans is great for people like me. Love your products!!!
"I purchased these pots and pans for my Son from his House warming list that I created for him here. Looking at 20 different sets of pots and pans...he thought these were Manly. I should have taken pic's when we 1st opened the box...sorry 4 that..Because I rely on Amazon Product pics as well. I saw these same pots in 2 dfferent retail stores each one sold out. So by them HERE!! If I can laer edit or add photos to this revew I will. We both luv this set. Easy to clean, durable and thr pots/pans are as pictured. No missing pieces, no cracks (glass lids) and works on Electric and Gas stoves. Don't worry...women who cook will absolutely adore these Gotham pots and pans."
"I love the pans, my brother is a chef and recommended I throw all my pots and pans away and order these bc they are safer and scratch resistant... I enjoy cooking with them but unfortunately the bigger pot scratched really bad inside after I cooked mashed potatoes, I didn’t even use metal utensils so I’m shocked. I won’t be ordering them again bc for the price it’s just not worth when one gets ruined the first time you use it:/"
"I sent these back. They're an ""okay"" set, and I might recommend them if it's your first apartment, but overall they're not worth the money and they won't last long. Remember: you need to use nonstick cookware on low to medium heat to keep from damaging the non-stick, if you do buy these! Regardless, they weren't what I was looking for. The handles get blazing hot because they're just metal, and the way they're silver clashes badly with the granite gray bottoms and the copper inside. I wanted a nice and functional set to hang on my pot rack, and this just wasn't it. I went with the beautiful EsteLife set instead... more expensive, but doesn't look cheap like these do. Like I said, if you're just going to keep them in a cabinet or it's your first set, I won't try to dissuade you... but overall not worth it."
The largest skillet is what I would call a medium. If you want a big skillet you will have to add to this set. Otherwise it is a good starter set with a nice variety of pieces. I like the copper non-stick. They are light weight. The handles are designed to keep cool but can feel a little sharp around the edges because of this. Most every pot/pan has a lid and that is nice. They have the venting lids so helps some in over boil.
"These pots and pans directly replaced several accumulated skillets I had for probably close to a decade. The nonstick qualities of these is fantastic (perhaps even too good! I find it hard to get a spatula under things some of the time)! They heat up very well on my gas burner stove, and provided an excellent brown to large pancakes on their first use. Cleanup has been a breeze, as nothing I've thrown at them yet has stuck to them. A quick wipe with a sponge and a rinse in some water, and they're good to go again. It's great also having lids with so many pans, as that makes the set extra versatile! I've also found the thick, sharply-angled edges to be particularly good at cracking eggs for breakfast!  The only downside was a lack of a 12"" skillet, but that was easily solved by just purchasing one separately."
"Absolutely love this set of pots and pans! If you are looking for a quality set that is reasonably priced, look no further. I specifically remember the infomercials about these pots and pans using the Gotham steel and copper non-stick coating but never Believed the hype. I cook 5-6 days out the week and so a good set of pans is important to me. The heat is even and the pans don’t rock back and forth like cheap ones do. My eggs were perfect and there was no sticking to the bottom (lightly coated it with Pam but you don’t have to). My onions and garlic cooked perfectly and didn’t brown too fast. I’m coming from a gas stove to an electric so heat control and good pans I’ve realized are key to a proper cook on on all my food. BUY THESE."
"When we first used these pans they were great! After just 3 months they are terrible. Non stick is completely gone. We're very disappointed and will buy a better set next time. Not suitable, tough to clean and worried it may be chipping of into our food. Please bear if you purchase this set."
"I bought these pans to replace my old pans that had become scratched and the costing was scraping off. I like the even heat distribution, it takes less heat. They are extremely easy to clean. Really do not need oil or butter unless you want them for flavor. They are not scratch resistent. I have seen a few scratches on one of my pans. I try to use wooden utensils to minimize scratching."
Beautiful and they work as advertised i.e. non stick and temperature controlled handles. The only thing you have to worry about is the lids do not have a temperature controlled handle. Pot holder needed!
"I bought these as all my other teflon pots were getting scratched and cruddy looking. These are beautiful with the gold finish inside. I'm not being careful with what I use to stir things (anything handy) and I haven't noticed any scratches. The write up said that the handles stay cool to the touch and I assumed that included the lids. The pot and pan handles do indeed stay cool but you definitely need to use a pot holder when lifting the lids from the pots on the stove. The Lids Handles Get HOT. Otherwise, now knowing that I am considering getting another set for my Snowbird residence."
I waited 2 months before reviewing. These pots & pans haven't disappointed. Sturdy yet lightweight and super easy to clean. Affordable price a total plus.
"Great product for the cost, others have posted that they used them once and they were damaged, been using these for about a month now and not a single thing wrong with them. High heat, low heat, nothing sticks, easy flip. Thought the handles would have gotten hot but everything has been great. Highly recommend getting rubber/silicone or wooden utensils to ensure they last long"
"These nonstick pots and pans work great for my cooking style. I love the nonstick surface and also the weight. They’re not too lightweight, and they’re very durable. I really enjoy cooking with these."
"For the price, you just can't beat this product. They're easy to clean, heat up quick, and create a perfect sear on steaks/fish. We bought this set and pretty much trashed everything else we had."
"Usually when I cook eggs, I have to put a ton of butter in order for it to not stick to the pan. But with this new set I don’t have to worry about using butter at all. You know those pancake tricks where you toss it into the air. I can do that with my eggs now because it’s a non stick. AMAZING!!"
"I love the ceramic nonstick pans. I ordered these as they were cheap and we were moving and had nothing. They have, however, given us no compelling reason to replace them. I recommend."
My daughter bought this for my birthday after buying me just one pan 2 years ago for Christmas. I loved that pan and now with the whole set it is awesum. I have had several pan sets over the years and this one will be my last.
I can throw them in the dishwasher. They work great. I do use a mit cause the lids get hot but other than that they are a great set
I had such a old set of pots and pans so it was time for new ones. I love the fact that you can use metal utensils on them and don't scratch. the only thing i wish it had a bigger frying pan. I can just get one from another store. But love the color blue and would buy from this seller again...
"My only complaint is the handle does get hot. I just have to remember to oven gloves when holding handle or removing lid. I do wish the vent was closeable. But as far as non-stick, they are amazing!"
"These are the best pans I’ve owned, and I’ve been an Analon owner for 30 years. They’re light weight and cook food perfectly."
"I hadn’t bought new pots and pans for 30+ years. I wanted pans that were light weight, good reviews and easy to clean.  I got my dish. Love these pans."
"I’ve had these pans for a month now, and I have to say that I regret having doubted the hype around them. They are great: I find my food cooks faster and more evenly than with my old pan, and the sizes are deceptively accommodating for your everyday needs."
"I love this set. They're extremely easy to clean and they cook so well. I've been using them for 2 months now and taking care when I clean, and nothing has a scratch on it. Amazing set!"
"These pots/pans heat up quickly. The handles do not get hot at all, when using them stovetop, as that was a concern of mine. They're very pretty and I like the matte finish on the outer/bottom part."
"So far, these pans are magnificent to work with. Excellent sear, great handles, easy to clean. Food just wipes right off. However, the square pan came dented in the lid. For the price, I wish it had been better taken care of. To pull a product out of the box already damaged is disheartening."
"We like the way all the pans heat and cook evenly. Clean up is fast and easy, nothing sticks and pans do not discolor ."
The woman of the house loves these pots and pans. She says nothing sticks even with only a little Olive oil under medium to high heat. I'm the dishwasher and they clean easy.
Perfect for or family. They look stylish and cook very well. Nothing sticks to them and they still look like new after a few months of use.
"I got these for Christmas and they are amazing. I am someone who cooks 3 plus times a day and these hold up. I’ve washed them a bunch already and they haven’t tarnished, scratched or lost any nonstick yet. Love these. They distribute the heat great! I would definitely buy again."
I know it’s good goes in the oven n all I just am not there yet to use it !! This LASTS FOREVER IT WILL OUT LIVE YOU !!!
These pots and pans are amazing! The nonstick quality was a major factor and they did not let me down. So easy to clean and so visually appealing.
These pots and pans are real easy to clean and also light in the hand.
"We love this brand and knew we wanted to get our next set from them. They don’t disappoint! We use them for every meal, and they deliver every time! 100% recommend!"
"I have never bought a good set of pans, always the cheap crap. Well I am very glad I bought these! Cook great and very easy to clean. I even burnt cheese on the one pan just to test it..... very please! Worth the purchase."
"Great quality and beautiful-looking pan set. My only want would the 12"" sauce pan included."
The best cookware set we have ever bought. These babies get hot fast and clean easily. No more stuck on food and scrubbing. We will order this brand from now on.
I bought these for my mother to replace her 30+ year old set. She loves them!
Super easy to clean even the nxt day ausom buy
These pans work very well and easy to clean
"We’ve owned a few different brands of pots and pans, from cheap to expensive, and this is by far the best ones we’ve had! Not too expensive and they hold up better than any other ones we’ve had! Wish there were other color options, but they’re so worth it!"
Buen producto
"Item was of the most prime quality! The packaging was very, very lovely. Very, very choice delivery."
"I’ve used them almost daily for a few months now, and I have no complaints! They’re easy to clean, they cook evenly, and the non-stick surface holds up well."
"They are great. Sturdy, non stick, easy to clean. Bottom doesn’t scratch."
Love! Love! Love! Definitely worth the money.
I love these pots and pans. Easy to clean and have sturdy handles.
This set of pots and pans cook without sticking. Very easy to clean up. Not heavy to lift.
These are no messy pans. Easy to clean. You can cook your meals using a lower temperature set in your stove than the usual to fry or boil saving electricity and $$.
Love them
Sebe bien
Really love these pans and I’m pretty picky when it comes to my cookware.
Good value!
They are easy to clean. I use a very small amount of olive oil.
I bought these for my daughter's first apartment. She loves them. Easy to clean and don't scratch.
I’ve been cooking wrong my whole life. These pots and pans are amaaaaaazing! Definitely only need it barely on medium and they cook nice and even and nothing sticks. Super easy to clean up afterwards too. I am going to be buying the baking set too!
"Great pans, nice color, cooks great, so far no scratches."
"I love these pots and pans. I am a junior in college and needed some for my apartment. I wanted nice ones but not ones that would break my wallet. These are perfect. They are easy to clean, chemical free, and overall just great great quality. I am so impressed. Definitely worth the price! Hopefully they last me a couple of years :)"
This set is just as described. Durable and non stick. Love it!
"Easy to clean, very solid material, and very good looking set, I love it."
awesome
These are the best pots and pans I have ever gotten. They are nonstick and they make my food taste better. I even bought my mom a set.
MAIN REASON IS THAT DOES NOT CONTAINS TEFLON AND IS USED FOR COOKING PURPOSES
Love these pots/pans!
Yes these are the truth. Truly non stuck and they look nice. No weird taste to the food and super easy to clean!
"Happy customer right here. I love this cookware set. So easy to clean, nothing sticks and great value for your money."
"My review is based upon initial impression and use only. I will update long term as needed. I wasn't expecting this pan to be as nice as it was when I unboxed it. The bottom is thicker than skillets I'm used to in this price point. Every non-stick skillet I've bought for less than $30.00 warped and wobbled on the burner, causing oil to pool on one side, or deflect away from the center of the pan and pool up around the edge. This thing is thick and robust.  The handle rivets are nice and solid. I cranked on them a little and they don't budge. The main handle is long and solid. It angles up a bit which is nice, it keeps your hands away from the hot burner. That being said, it is a bit longer than most skillet or pans you use on your stove (it's 10.5 inches long), I wish it were a bit shorter, or had the option for two helper handles instead. My kitchen and work area is small so I find myself bumping into it. I can't dock it a star for the handle length, it really needs to be that long due to the size and weight of the pan, but still, it annoys me.  Temperature was surprisingly fairly consistent across the pan. Due to the thicker bottom I heated the pan on medium for about 10 minutes to let the heat disperse evenly thru the pan. Using a laser thermometer I measured the center of the pan out to all of the edges. The biggest variance I got was about 7 degrees, which isn't bad at all, especially for a sub $30.00 pan. The pan was still 98 degrees 20 minutes after being removed from the heat, which kind of surprised me a little.  All in all I'm really thrilled with this pan. It comes with a 1 year warranty and if it lasts that long with proper use, I'll be thrilled. I haven't had a cheap, non-stick pan last me more than a few months before warping or flaking.  Be sure to order you some nice silicone utensils to use with this to keep from damaging the non-stick surface."
"I bought this pan because I wanted an affordable pan that wasn’t going to ooze chemicals like nonstick but also wouldn’t burn/stick to all of my food and be impossible to clean: this one fit the bill! It does take some time to get used to but follow my tips and 99% of what you make won’t stick and the cleanup will be seem less and easy: 1. PREHEAT this pan... what does that mean? It means you heat up the pan WITHOUT adding oil for about 3 minutes on medium heat, this prevents burning/sticking. Also, after adding the oil once it feels warm, wait about 1 minute to add anything. This is because stainless steel pans don’t react well to sudden temperature changes, and this is what causes sticking. If I use this method properly, I can cook an omelet fully without ANY sticking in about 1-2 minutes. 2. Once this pan heats up (you’ll know) slowly reduce the heat to prevent burning. At first to heat up the pan I will have it on medium heat (5), after a couple minutes, I can have it on low heat (1) and it will still be cooking my food well because the heat distribution is so good. Don’t overheat this pan under any circumstances, there’s no need! 3. Don’t use a brillo pad on this pan, it’s bad for heat distribution longterm... if you end up with some burning, scrub it with a scrubby and soap, if that doesn’t work, boil some vinegar in it, add baking soda, and scrub; EVERYTHING eventually comes off with this method.  This pan is truly amazing and I love it, and once you get used to it you’ll never remember what grief other pans gave you. It’s super durable and can always be brought back from the dead. Highly recommend!"
"This pan is great! You must remember to season it first, but that's very easy with a stainless pan. Now that I see the quality of Amazon Commercial, I will be buying more from this line. I have worked as a Chef for more than 30 years and know my stuff!"
"Absolutely huge! On the left normal 11"" pan, on the right Amazon Commercial 16"". Just be sure it fits your stove."
"We wanted to get away from non-stick cooking items due to the unnatural chemicals used in such products. This pan has so far provided even heat distribution and the handle does stay cool to the touch. Comes clean pretty easily, as long as you don’t overcook and cause burns in the pan. When I’ve done this (because I’m no Gordon Ramsey) a little Bar Keepers Friend and a good scrub will get you good as new. If you haven’t cooked with stainless steel before, I find that I can cook with this pan at a much lower flame than other types of pans I’ve used in the past, therefore generating less heat in the house while I cook, (a nice bonus in Texas summers), and no burnt on mess. Highly recommend."
"As a former restaurant owner and professional cook (now, just in my residential kitchen), when my daughter was complaining about not having a skillet big enough for their needs (their biggest is a 12"" SS skillet), I decided to buy her what I would classify as a professional level skillet. In the restaurant business I always bought expensive skillets because they do a heck of a lot better job of cooking everything. I want a stainless steel aluminum clad thick bottom skillet which will distribute heat evenly and not just in the hot spots above a gas flame or a ceramic heating element. My skillets from restaurant supply vendors usually ran above $150 to $200. You get what you pay for.  Not wanting to spend that much for a gift in residential use, I went on a search for a very large skillet that I felt would meet my and her needs. I was surprised to find this ""beast"" of a skillet which was larger than almost all others I ran across. And, another thing that is extremely important to me is having a bullet proof surface which I can scour with steel wool, to clean hard to remove stuff after cooking. This skillet will have no problem being aggressively scrubbed with steel wool and will not suffer on iota of damage in doing so.  The bottom is very thick and even in heat distribution. And for its size the helper handle at the opposite end of the main handle is a must, to move it around when loaded. This can also be used in the oven with its deep size it can pull double duty for things like searing meats, roasts in it and then putting a lid on it to pop into the oven to finish off a slow bake for tenderness.  As an accomplished cook, the only draw back is having the deep straight sides so you have to flip contents with a spatula, instead of the ""in the air, flip method"" with skillets that have gently curved sides on them. But the type of cooking to be done in this one is probably not what you would need to flip contents anyway, since there would be too much in the skillet.  This is an impressive skillet for a fraction of the cost of a ""true"" professional skillet and I would have no problem using it in my commercial kitchen if I were still in the business."
"I was looking for a solid omelet pan, and this one does not disappoint! I've been trying to perfect my technique when it comes to French omelets and omurice, and this thing really helped me take it to the next level. The 8"" version is perfect for three egg French omelets. It heats evenly and only requires a minimal amount of added fat (I've been getting by with a half tablespoon of butter for a three egg omelet). I've seriously not had a single one not turn out since this arrived at my door. I'm anticipating that this pan will enjoy a long life, as I use it solely for eggs, do not ever expose it to heat above medium, never touch it with anything other than silicon cooking chopsticks (try them, they're a game changer when it comes to getting perfect small curds for your omelet's interior - https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Chopsticks-Stainless-Reinforced-Eco-Friendly/dp/B07QHFNC1N/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=silicone+chopsticks&qid=1618687966&sr=8-6) or a silicon spatula. It also cleans up like a dream. I'm able to just wipe it clean with a paper towel. Anyone who gives this pan a bad review either doesn't know what they're doing or is treating the pan poorly."
"Thick bottom....just the way I like it. This pan is huge and heavy. I have an extra large burner called ""Power Boil"" and on full blast is still not getting full coverage. The thick base will help but even if you have just average sized burners you might get some hot spots and such. The picture was 5 good sized pork chops....I could have fit 10. I have cooked 5 fat NY Strips in a single go. Two pounds of cooked pasta with Chicken Broccoli....still room to stir it without making a mess. Love this pan. If you have the space/room/burners for it, you will not be dissapointed.  EDIT: Still a great pan. I wanted to add that the ""Winco Stock Pot Cover, 60-Quart"" aluminum lid fits the 16"" version of this pan perfectly if you are looking for a cover for this. www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HEOT0S"
"I thought a 2"" bump from my previous 14"" mega-pan would be barely noticeable, but man, was I wrong. This thing is gargantuan, even by my standards! It heats up well and evenly, and seems to be in line with the rest of the (clad bottom, off-brand) stainless fry pans in my arsenal. If I had it to do over again I would probably get the smaller one - but you know what they say: buy the ticket, take the ride!"
"I haven't had a chance to use it yet and so far I only got as far as washing and examining it. From what I can see it looks very well made and feels very sturdy, I bought it to replace my old pan which measured 12 in wide and a little over 3 inches deep, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the description said 12x24x3.4 and I made the mistake of thinking the 3.4 meant depth but the actual depth is 2.5 so now I'm wondering what 3.4in. meant?"
"This pan works very nearly as well as my much more expensive top of the line pans with copper core all clad in stainless steel. Thickness of the base and sides are solid. The round handle is poor design choice making i easy to spin and thus spill the co tents of the pan, however the sheer weight of this pan especially when loaded with food would make it impossible to hold one handed, therefor the helper handle is required to lift this pan making my criticism of the handle just nit picking."
"Wow. BIG. .. much larger then expected. I cooked lg. steak, onions, and green beans and still had room for potatoes...love it...cleaned up well...originally got for making 1 1/2 lb. bacon in 1 pan... it does and then some."
"Heat distribution is amazingly even, love the long metal handle, and the surface is slick and durable. This is an amazing value and although an Amazon branded product, shows that the evil empire is interested in making quality product. It's the Calphalon killer, maybe unfortunately. Not that I have allegiances, but it is a joy to cook with, politics aside. Easily the favorite big frying pan I've ever owned."
I love to cook big one pot meals for my family and this is the end of the road for pans meeting that need. It’s HUGE! I made a double batch of stuffing in this thing for thanksgiving and I could have made even MORE. Nonstick coating is nice. Heat distribution leaves a little to be desired but that makes sense with how big it is and I don’t fault the pan but the small size of my stove burners in comparison. Wish it came with a lid but it’s awesome.
This pan cooked all my breakfast bacon just the way I like it & all the French toast. It cut down my cooking time by 1 1/2 hours. It is MUCH bigger then I thought it would be & takes 2 burners BUT it is very easy to clean!!
"I love this pan. It's heavy duty, sits flat on my glasstop stove and nothing sticks to the pan without washing off so easily! I don't have to spray the pan or add butter. Even eggs come right out when wiping! It looks nice and expensive too!"
"I am careful about non-sticky pans can potentially release toxic chemicals and decided to buy stainless steel frying pans. To my surprised, it's not too sticky to the food, less sticky than a bigger stainless pans I have. I stir fry food a few times. Heat was conducted very fast and food tasted good. Just be careful about the handle. It can get very hot on medium high gas setting. The price is very good. So, I am happy for the purchase."
No coating with chemical. Easy seasoning for non stick.. just pre heat before cook! Comfortable for washing with steel sponge also there are no rivets inside of stainless pan.
You better be cooking for 4+ people at the same time. This is a Big Freaking Pan
"I was so worried that at this price, I would be unhappy... I was pleasantly surprised! This pan has become my go-to in my kitchen arsenal! It was inexpensive and works so well! I love it!"
"Even thought I did not buy this pan for my self the person who has it said she is loving it. She is 90 years old and says it cooks great, and cleans up beautiful. Fully satisified with the pan."
None stick coating coming off
Very good pan cooks evenly easy to clean nice
I was looking for a stainless steel pan that was non stick and get a very good deal.
Love this versital pan.
This is exactly what i have been looking for. Be aware that it is heavy
"I used it once and it didn't get clean enough... only made eggs, I don't get what happened"
Just opened it. Washed it and cooked an egg in it. I love the simple design and sturdy build. The thick bottom heats evenly. Definitely recommend!
Perfect size. I like the second handle. When is fan is full it is heavy
Rust after two weeks of use!
Amazingly well made pan at an incredible price.
This is the perfect size for smaller omelets etc!!!
"Purchased this pan 6/10/2021. The nonstick coating was fantastic - for two weeks. In spite of not washing it in the dishwasher, using silicone spatulas, using only low or simmer heat, the coating around the edges of this pan where it joins the sides was worthless in two weeks. Anything near the edges of the bottom of this pan sticks so badly that it is a burnt, brown mess that one has to scrape off with a silicone spatula. Even that is not entirely successful. There is constant residue near the edges and up the sides."
Oven-safe up to 500°F that is higher than most at this price.
Perfect size and deeper than most.
I love the size and sturdiness of this pan. I cook for 24-48 people and this is the perfect size. Haven't had it long enough to test its durability but will update if I find anything wrong.
Gr8 everything is good 👍 love it!!
I use this pan daily. It’s better built than I thought it would be. Cleans up very easily. Cooks very evenly.
To fry eggs
Fantastic little pan. Great value for the money!
Cooks evenly. Easy to clean. Extra handle makes it easy to carry when heavy. Very pleased with this pan.
"I bought this for my daughter, She just said she loves that pan."
Very high quality and it distributes heat evenly. No sticking problem either. The only downside is that it is very heavy. It is also a little too long to ever put in our oven. Easy to clean.
"Trying to give the impression this is a professional pan by using the word commercial in its title is a bit deceptive, its a decent pan (I got the 8"") its deep so not a lot of flipping going on.  It works fine, the non-stick is good. I dont expect to get more than 2 years on any non-stick pan before it needs replacing and this should be good for that.  The sides are VERY thin, if you drop it its going to dent/bend if it lands on an edge, that being said the clad disk on the bottom is heavy enough to keep enough heat.  Overall its a decent ""cheap"" non-stick pan... dont expect more than that and youll be quite happy..."
Quality seemed really good but it was too big for my tiny stove. Was sad to return it. Would definitely buy again when I have a bigger stove.
Awesome pan. Perfect size for my needs. Cleans up easily. Nice and sturdy for cooking. Excellent cookware for the money.
This is exactly what I was looking for in my tiny kitchen.
"Pan is pretty great. I needed a replacement for a cheap set that was wearing out. Heat distribution is pretty good, not excellent but pretty good. The nonstick is great! Nothing sticks and it’s easy to clean. I had a moment of stupidity and used a fork to pad some butter around and scratched it but it’s only visible in the light... the reason for 4 vs 5 stars is the thickness of the sides. I was hoping for something a bit more substantial. Overall an excellent value. So much I got the smaller size!"
"Initially, I got this and it worked really well, it was almost like a non-stick pan, very easy to clean and very functional. Here is the comment from my original review:  > My 3 burgers spread around my 11"" pan cooked beautifully - I mean perfectly. > Although this pan is more utilitarian than beautiful or a status symbol, it is > pretty enough and it amazes me. The 11"" size is light enough for my girlfriend > to handle and large enough to cook a big meal ... it is a good size for me who > wants to only have 1 frying pan.  > This pan has a very thick heat-conducting bottom that spreads heat evenly, > such that all 3 of my burgers cooked exactly the same on my gas stove. When > I took them out and cleaned the pan in my sink it cleaned up easily with a drop > of detergent and a simple scrub brush.  The problem is that now that I have had this for a few months every time I cook something with it, it is hell to clean. The sides of the inside of the pan simply will not scrub clean, and not the bottom of the pan is the same. I cooked salmon in the pan last night and there are food stains and residue in the bottom that I simply cannot get off. I think I'd be better off with a cast iron skillet ... except for the bulky weight.  I have to reduce my glowing recommendation for this pan from a 5 to a 2. I even tried to use my drill with a heavy brush cleaning attachment on it and that will not clean it up. I am so disappointed after initially being so happy to find a great product. I don't know if this is something I am doing ( I think not since I did not have this kind of problem with my previous frying pans ) or what it could be about this certain pan?  Sadly lowering rating from 5/5 to 2/5."
"I’ve been cooking with this pan for 4 months straight (approximately 116 days sometimes 2-3 times per day) during the stay at home order. It cooks evenly and it feels heavy and solid built. I especially enjoy being able to cook some meals in the oven with it. And, for most of the 4 months, the Teflon/cooking surface was slick and easy to wash. Fast forward to the 4th month, the cooking surface is starting to break down and food is starting to get stuck while cooking, and harder during washing. Another downside is the pan handle is quite long; making it difficult to store with other pans in a cabinet. Overall, for $35, I think it’s worth it for how many times it gets used, and at a good quality."
Nice pan for the price
"The handle holds water, which turns it into a surprising burn hazard. For the first couple of uses, this pan seemed to work well. It performs as intended for a nonstick in this price range. The handle, however, is poorly made and when the pan is submerged in water, will take on water. The water conducts heat when used and suddenly, when using a pan that should not require any sort of silicone or hot pad, it becomes a several hundred degree, skin peeling, four letter word summoning monster."
"Great pan, very light for the size. Heats quickly and evenly, and the added handle makes it easy to work with.  The only con, and this isn't an issue with this pan specifically but all stainless pans in general, is that it is NOT a nonstick. Foods like potatoes WILL stick like glue to these things, even if you absolutely drown it in oil. Stuck on foods are pretty hard to get out of these pans, but a good scouring sponge will get it done.  If you know that going in, these are fantastic pans for the money. Highly recommended."
Best skillet I ever bought. Will buy more in larger sizes to replace my supposed non stick ones
"We go through pans often and we're hard on them. Mostly we end up with the non-stickiness no longer being non-stick and everything sticking the pan, which (obviously) defeats the purpose. We've had many different brands, all on the higher-end; we tend to stick with higher quality, but they always devolve into the same thing. I've been pretty happy with the Amazon-branded items in the past so I decided to try this.  For the price, these are the best value pans yet. We've had a set of these (three different sizes) for a year now and they are almost as good as new, albeit for a few scratches. They are heavy with a nice bottom core that heats evenly and keeps the heat stable. The handles do not get hot, but they are long, particularly on the large 12"" one. The non-stick coating seems to be holding up well, but I will say it scratches a little easily, but doesn't wear through. We use only nylon, wood and silicone tools in them, but somehow they still get scratched. After 1 year of constant use, they are still holding up well. For the price, these are amazing."
"I researched for months to find a good quality pan for my oversized burner on my glass top stove, and I couldn’t be happier!! It is deep enough to hold rice dishes (Moro, Asopao) and the food does not stick. If you do happen to burn, or use really high heat, the food scrapes right out and does not leave any marks. The bottom heats evenly and is reinforced. So far, the handles stay cool and it is a solidly built pan. I’m going to buy another to gift to my sister. I did buy a universal lid (Amazon’s best seller) and it fits just right. So highly recommend this pan. I use it everyday and often more than once."
Don’t buy this. Everything sticks and it stained immediately. I tried to work with it but the RETURN WINDOW is only 30 days. So I’m 3 days too late. I suppose now it will be a good weapon for an intruder.
"Very good quality for the price. Be aware, this pan is HUGE!"
"Replaced a Tremontina 14” non stick pan with this pan. Used several weeks, very well made. Even slow heating (where hot spots tend to kill non stick pans). Compared to the Tramontina 14” non stick pan, better build quality than the Tramontina… The bottom is perfectly flat, where the Tramontina was raised in the center, which was extraordinarily irritating making eggs.  Negatives, it’s the size of a small volkswagen. Feels 25% bigger than the Tramontina, quite a bit heavier, quite a bit deeper. Doesn’t even fit in the same place the Tramontina did, had to find somewhere else in the kitchen for it. I would one hand the Tramontina exclusively… this one, i’ve used the helper handle several times. Its just slightly larger than the largest burner on the stove, so works, but I couldn’t go any larger."
In my opinion and I am not an expert but it does what I need it to do. It retains heat well enough for me and it is small and easy to store. For me I notice it gets hot very fast and I try to warm my pans on slowly starting from a low heat but even with my weird methods it heats way faster then I expect! I have not used this a lot of times yet because I bought this small stainless steel pan for certain situations and not for things like eggs or fish. I am considering getting the nonstick version for those purposes. Will edit if it does not last long. But perfect so far and especially because the price was so reasonable
Love the size and handle. My new go to skillet!!
Great skillet!
I am very picky on buying cook wear and Cephalon is my preferred choice and the Higher commercial end of T Fall So this is AMAZONS brand and I am liking it. I needed a good small frying pan and this one has some weight to it and I love that. It stays flat on the stove. Easy to clean and handle stays cool even though it is metal. SO far I am loving this and if It continues to hold up I will write another review. So far Thumbs UP for sure and YES I am very happy with it and so far it is performing better than I expected.
"Update: even scrubbed bar keeper's friend to get it this shiny, have only used it a few times. I prefer my Misen pan by far. I will be buying more Misen in the future.  You get what you pay for.  I seasoned my pan and it stained the sides a little. No big deal to me but it is harder to clean, but far more durable and I feel much safer eating out of this pan than say the nonstick pan a roommate or friend may use and stir with a metal utensil! I haven't done eggs in it, I use my non-stick pan for that! But meats went perfectly fine. I do need a bigger pan but I am seeking to invest in a more expensive pan. This was right for the price and a meal for 1 or maybe 2. Overall I would buy this pan again."
I can't stand it when my product stains right away. This was also much bigger than I expected.
"14” ended up being WAY too big for our house, so unfortunately we are returning it. We didn’t use the pan to cook anything, but it feels nice and sturdy. I recommend cutting out a 14” circle from cardboard and placing it on your stovetop to get an accurate idea of exactly how big this thing is and to make sure it will fit on your burners/in your cupboard. It’s a beast!"
This pan seemed great until I used grape seed oil in it and the coating turned sticky in one side of the pan. When cleaning it using a deglazing method this hole appeared. Really disappointed there’s only a 90 day warranty which ran out in November and this occurred in December.
"Heating is uneven. I use an infrared thermometer and there is a 30 degree difference in some spots. It heats slowly. And if you add frozen vegetables the temperature quickly drops and takes a long time to recover. Stainless steel is much better if you do stir fry.  I also have the 8"" version. That one developed some small scratches in the coating after a few uses. I use the same silicone spatulas. This suggests that quality isn't reliable."
"I’ve been looking for a reasonably priced induction ready frying pan this large for a while now. I’ve only used it a couple times since getting it and it works as advertised! Non stick, easy clean up, even heating..what more could you want. Only slightly negative thing is the handle doesn’t fit my hand well. Great value for the size and quality of this pan."
"I have an induction cooktop with a large 13” ring, and this is the only pan big enough to take advantage of it. Heats evenly and plenty of room, with tall enough sides. With good stainless steel care it has not discolored or been sticky at all. I bought a 14” lid on Amazon too. I use it daily for my family!"
"I purchased 1 pan on Amazon because the mixed reviews had me nervous about committing to a whole set. I have had my pan for a few months and it gets better and better. I loved the pan so much that as soon as Costco had them on there site again I purchased the set. I use the pans everyday from eggs to steak. Let me address some of the worries I had after reading reviews. Sticking- The pans need to be seasoned when you receive them, there are instructions. For the first few uses even after seasoning food did stick however, the more you use the pan the better and better they get. Also, I learned that I need to cook at a lower temperature than I did with my Circulon pans. Clean Up- People complain they are hard to clean. Absolutely not true. They are the easies pans I have to clean and they look as beautiful as the day they arrived. I use a stainless steel scrubber and it gets all food and cooked on oil spots off. It seems scary the first time you take a hard steel scrubber to the pan but, the pan does not scratch. You can also use bar keepers friend but I haven't had to use it yet. Just a steel scrubber. Black residue- There is a black residue on the pans the comes off when you clean the pans before first use. It is a polish they use on the shinny smooth part of the pan. It cleans off just fine.  I am so glad that I gave the pan a try and didn't judge the pan after the first handful of uses. The pan cook brilliantly once you learn the correct lower temperature and once they are seasoned, which does take a little time."
I bought the hype literally. Im not sure what these other people are buying but this pan is not good. Especially for the money this pan costs. Not worth it. My egg stuck to it not once but twice. Thought it would get better after it heated up really hot but nope it stuck. Now im returning it.
"I have a Panasonic induced hot plate KZ-CX1 which is able to pin the temperature at a specified number, say 180 degrees celsius for eggs and pancakes, or 230/250 degrees celsius for wagyu steaks. With this machine, I found it very hard to burn eggs or meats to sticky carbons on this frying pan, even if oil is not applied. I am not saying that eggs or meats won't burn to carbons on it, but not so soon, and as a result, not so sticky that I could not shove them off the pan.  I like it. Maybe those who burned food to carbons on it simply do not have good fire power control, or they got a malfunctional product which hit the bulleye of the bad yield rate."

"I have only had the Hexcalad pan for a week or so, but I am impressed with its performance. I can actually lower the burner setting and get the same heat distribution that I was getting from my older no-stick pans. Clean-up is easy, but I have noticed some discoloration in the ""non-hex"" area around the rim. The pan is supposed to get better as time goes on like cast iron does, but I haven't had it long enough to see that. That said, it's important to follow the seasoning instructions that come with the pan to make sure it works to the best of its ability."
"I bought both the 12"" and the 10"" skillets and they are wonderful! Truly nonstick and very easy to clean. Plus, you can use metal utensils and even scouring pads with no damage. I was so tired of buying nonstick pans that worked for only a few uses before everything stuck to them and they became useless. These pans will last forever and you don't have to baby them. Yes, they are expensive, but so worth it!  DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY HEXCLAD PANS. THEY WILL LAST A LIFETIME AND THE MORE YOU USE THEM, THE MORE YOU WILL LOVE THEM!! IF YOU HAVE ANY WEDDINGS COMING UP, BUY THE COUPLE THESE PANS AS A GIFT NOW WHILE THEY ARE YOUNG. THEY WILL ENJOY THEM THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND WILL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER PAN OR SKILLET--EVER!"
"I was hesitant about buying a ""hybrid"" skillet that was supposed to be non-stick. I've had bad luck with non-stick skillets but this one said it wouldn't stick and I could use any kind of utensil on it. I've cooked several different types of food in it, including eggs and haven't had any problems. I have scrubbed it but always put a little oil in it and rub in in with a paper towel after drying it and have had no problems. It's heavy enough and easy to handle, came wrapped and in good shape. I would recommend this and will most likely buy another one."
Is NOT made for high heat and warped after a couple of uses. Not a good pan overall.
"I bought this a while back and wanted to wait to review it. I seasoned it with olive oil and was a bit skeptical. I couldn't fathom how a pattern like that on the cooking surface of the pan would allow no sticking, but once seasoned I have cooked several items in this pan and never had anything stick to it. I cooked eggs in it this morning and I like my eggs over easy, so you can imagine that sticking would be an issue. I was very pleased with how I could flip the eggs in this pan and never have to touch them with a utensil. I have not had to or desire to cook anything above medium, the heat distribution in this pan is perfect, it heats up fast and even. It is very well made, and heavy but easy to clean, I don't normally put pans like this in the dishwasher but occasionally will put this in just to clean it really good, I will typically season it again after doing so, not much just a little olive oil and about 30 minutes on medium-low heat gets it good to go."

"I wasn't sure what to expect as, like many others, have gone through almost the full gamut of non stick pans. I'm really impressed by this one, the non stick qualities are great, it passed the egg test as best as I could hope for. What's really impressive is that it got very heavily burnt on food from cooking, and I didn't have brillo or a scrub pad, so I used the back of the sponge to clean it. It didn't make it look super nice BUT it's non stick properties we're still retained as opposed to other pans. I got a scout pad in two days later and scrubbed it easily back to new, looks like I just bought it. And again, after all that scrubbing and it's like nothing happened.  I will definitely be buying more of these pans! As of right now this is a 5 star pan, if in the future it start degrading I will jump back in here to post an update but I honestly don't believe that will happen."
"They claim little or no spray or oil...bull! These are no different than any other ""nonstick"" fry pan. Everything sticks with ""little or no"" spray or oil. Cleanup? LOL...difficult!  Buy a cheap nonstick fry pan for $10 and it will be as good as these."
I absolutely love this pan. It delivers on all its promises and is fantastic to work with. I liked it so much that I ended up buying their whole pot set up and those are fantastic as well. I’m a big Hexclad fan now. Just waiting for them to come out with a roasting pan… hopefully soon :)
I didn’t rate durability as I have only used it twice. I tried eggs as many said they stuck. Used a bit of oil and a bit of butter for taste at 180 on my induction corner and no sticking. I seared a steak on highest setting then turned way down and it was great. I washed by hand and was easy. Didn’t have any problems. Keep it in the bag it came in and oiled lightly. So far I love it. Will give it some time and use more before buying a set as they are not cheap.
"I was hesitant on buying this but I’m glad I purchased it. It’s a great pan for anything. If found it’s best to start on a low heat. Eggs come out beautifully, scrambled are also not difficult getting the pan clean after. It came in a very nice cloth cover bad to store it in. I feel the price is right for this quality of a 10” pan."
"Heavy weight, perfectly level, distributes heat evenly, you can use metal cooking utensils - no problem. Dishwasher safe. It also goes from stovetop to oven. I bought the lid separately and I love the set. I'm going to buy the set in the 12"" as well. I think I could probably make a pizza in the 12"" one. Best ever!!"
My non-stick pans were wearing out after a few years use. I bought this frying pan and I use it almost exclusively. I am very impressed with how well it cooks everything from grilled cheese to steaks and all inbetween. I find it cleans up very well with a plastic scrubbing cloth and Dawn. I keep it shiney and enjoy using it. When I need more pans I will be purchasing this brand for sure.
"I Love Eggs. Especially when the yoke is runny, be it fried or poached. I seasoned my pan as directed. My first try was ok, but the edges of the egg whites did stick a bit. After cooling, I rubbed more olive oil into the surface of the pan and left it set. Instructions say I can use cooking spray, so I did. Heated the pan up, dropped in my eggs, they slid out of the pan. What else can I say!"
Great pan. A little pricey but worth the money. Nice & slightly heavier (but not nearly as heavy as an iron skillet) than other non-stick pans I’ve bought in the past. Good kitchen investment. Will last forever if used as directed. Like the fact that I can use it on the stove top and in the oven.
"Honestly it’s really pricey, more than I’d normally like to spend on a pan but I’m pretty amazed at its ability to retain heat. With proper seasoning and use of oil there hasn’t been much sticking issues. If it does stick for whatever reason it’s super easy to clean."
"Best non-stick pan I've ever owned. nothing sticks to it, even on MID-HIGH heat. a bit pricey but after you use it, you may not think so. I did not buy the overpriced lid. I just use a lid I have at home from a previous pan and it fits. Highly recommended"
I have other sizes of HexClad pans and love them also. Even dried eggs will clean out with a little soak in water or a little Bar Keepers Friend to remove the most stubborn stain. The pan has even heat distribution and I find a lower heat setting is good because or efficient heat transfer.
We are a huge ALL-Clad family. The Hex-Clad I like better than the regular All-Clad. It is non-stick and extremely easy to clean. We purchased this skillet for a test but will be purchasing the other pots & pans in the near future. I only wish they made bakeware. Hopefully coming soon. These will last a lifetime just like the All-Clad.
"I honestly don’t know how a pan could be any better. First of all nothing sticks to it, even with little oil. You can use any utensils on it. The first time I had to grab the handle while cooking I was amazed at how cool it was. No potholder necessary. I just wish I had room in my kitchen to buy the whole set."
"This pan has the weight of substantial cookware, not lightweight aluminum. I followed the directions about seasoning and about cooking especially sticky foods. I love that I don't have to worry about washing it. I love how it cooks scrambled eggs. Excellent pan!"
"I find this pan useless. It is neither non-stick or stainless. My stainless pans work great. My non-stick pans work great. EVERYTHING sticks to this pan. The seared bits of the fish stick and tear from the fillet. Blintzes stick and the brown part of the crepe peel off and stick to the pan. Eggs stick.  Really, for the money this thing should be great. It is not. Worst kitchen purchase ever on Amazon."
I make eggs in this pan everyday now for 2 months. Shows absolutely no sign of wear. A little spray oil and nothing sticks. Will definitely buy more.
"I ordered my first pan direct from Hexclad and LOVED it. I found this one on sale for much less, so I took a chance. It came in the original Hexclad box down to the printed materials and bag. It is great! I think I am going to get many years of cooking out of these!"
I like it because it don’t stick to the pan. Very well made. It’s very easy to clean. And a strong pan. Just amazing.
A heavy duty easy to clean pan. Kind of pricey but you get what you pay for.
"Make sure to season your pans well before first use. Follow the directions that come with the pan. Breakfast potatoes stuck a little bit, but as I use the pan more it seems to be getting better. Made savory crepes, and they flew right out of the pan!"
"This pan is worth the price tag! It was delivered quickly and well packaged. I ordered it as a gift for my husband, who has been wanting to invest in some high quality cookware. The pan itself heats to temperature very quickly, cooks evenly, and is visually very sleek looking. We've made some meals where food gets really cooked on or coated over the pan, and it's been very easy to clean off when washing dishes (no soaking required)! We really like this pan, and will be investing in more HexClad soon."
"After a week of use its been performing as expected. This morning however my wife with a gloomy voice said she has bad news. ""one egg of two stuck to our new frying pan and I even used oil"" I always thought you get what you paid for. I paid plenty for this pan, now at least in this case questioning that edict."
"So far have used mostly for cooking eggs, we seasoned pan according to instructions and eggs slid out with no sticking. Will update after using for different cooking."
I bought this frypan to test the product before replacing my present cookware. It is everything advertised and I plan to add to the collection.
"Easy to clean, non stick and using lower heat. It does 'hump up' a little in the middle, like all pans, when higher heat is used. I bought 12"" pans for myself, kids and grandkids."
I’m on my second pan and tossing everything else. This non-stick pan is safe and holds up to its claim on durability.
Very pleased with the product. Cooks evenly and cleans up quickly. My go to pan.
"It took a lot of butter and about ten stuck omelets before it became non-stick. I wasn't so sure about it, but I'm glad I persisted and now I would like more of this set."
"Well crafted, worked perfect for my need. Compared well with some very high qualty pans I use. Buy again if needed"
I seasoned as per instructions. Cooked a steak in no time. Clean up was easy. Hot soapy water does it. I recommend this to everyone.
"I switched to steel cookware about 11 months ago, i needed a non stick alternative for quick dishes. I have really enjoyed my hexclad pan. I clean it with baking soda each time and it looks like new!"
"I was skeptical but this pan quickly proved me wrong. Easy to season and have made grilled cheese, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, grilled meatloaf … all came out great and super easy cleanup."
"So far so good. The pan is easy to clean. I don’t use soap, just hot water like I do my stainless steel pans and that way it stays seasoned."
"The handle stays cool no matter what temp you are cooking at, the heat distribution is unlike any other pan I’ve ever used. If you don’t want to purchase the whole set start out with, get a 10” off of Amazon and base your opinion off of there. I love my set and it’s everything you’d expect it to be, if you can properly apply olive oil or butter when necessary then this product will not disappoint."
Love the pan. Easy to clean and cook. Just a little heavy. But worth the money
Nonstick mostly and super easy to clean. Great heat distribution. Can go in 500 degree oven.
So far it is great. I’m planning on buying more pieces.
Excellent heating properties. Coating with a thin layer of oil before use makes cleanup easy.
Very very good 👍
This pan cooks evenly and really nice pan that will hold up for years. Has LIFESTIME Warrenty...
"Let it heat up and use a small amount of oil or cooking spray, nothing sticks. I haven’t put it in dishwasher yet, just too easy to hand wash. Looking to buy the 8” next. Don’t be afraid use metal utensils either."
REALLY like this pan. Easy to use and clean. Highly recommend
Perfect from the first use. Cooks evenly on medium to low heat. Food is perfect every time. Exceeds my expectations for the perfect cookware.
It is what it is but my wife likes it.
Worth every penny. Food cooks beautifully
"Cooks well,non-stick, and cleaned up easily"
"Was everything they claim it to be, love it.."
Perfect meals for the first time.
I like this brand as much as I like my All Clad stainless steel. I highly recommend
Bought the 12in 6 month ago. We are hard on pans in this house. And these hold up!! Its like cooking with cast iron but better.Just got the 10in too As my pan wear out. They will all be replaced with Hexclad…
I like that food doesn’t stick.
"This pan rocks! Once i seasoned it up, it cooks everything perfectly. Perfect size to cook just about anything. Highly recommend."
Product is outstanding and does great at giving a great sear. All these reviews leaving one stars clearly didn't read and follow the simple directions. Trust me if you use the pan as directed it is perfect. Highly recommend
"It's a great pan - we own two. We always add a bit of olive oil or canola before cooking and they clean easier that Teflon, and no chemicals. The cost is higher than other non-stick pans, but there is no coatining - highly reccomend."
I was looking for a good nonstick pan for cooking eggs. This one does a good job.
I use this as my go to pan for just about every meal needing a pan...
"We’ll constructed, easy to clean and wonderful to cook with! I’ll be buying a whole set!"
"Impressed with the quality of this product. Not only does it cook very evenly, but after following the instructions for pre-seasoning the pan is very easy to clean after cooking."
"I wanted to love this pan, lifetime nonstick?! Who Wouldn't!? Unfortunately that did not pan out (pun intended!). The way this pan heats is great, I will admit I like that. But the non-stick is basically non existent. I reached out to Hexclad directly for help thinking it was defective based on the videos and all I got back was about 1 hours worth of YouTube videos on how to wash and season the pan. I traded this one for my Miesen nonstick skillet which I loved, but after 2 years the coating started to wear out so it was time to get a new one. I thought from the videos that this hexclad would be a great replacement and turned out it was not by any means. Sending me the YouTube videos (which I watched, then even had to season my pan) was not really how I wanted this. Anyway, I am going to be sending this back to Amazon since it does not seem to be nearly as ""perfect"" as the company says it is. That's my advice!"
